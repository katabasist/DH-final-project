open on the interior of owl cave, dark and silent. suddenly: voices coming closer.
cooper, truman, etc.
this way... careful andy...
flashlight beams illuminate the scene. agent cooper, sheriff truman,
deputy hawk and deputy andy enter. cooper and truman carry flashlights,
backpacks filled with excavation equipment. hawk holds a bright lantern. andy is armed
with sketch pad, pencils. all pause, turn toward the cave symbol. cooper reacts with a curse.
dammit.
the painting has been tampered with, ten dowels, with obscure symbols attached, now extend
from it, seemingly abstract, without obvious intent or meaning.
but who...?
hawk kneels at the base of the painting, casts lantern light upon the cave floor. he's examining
fresh tracks left in the dirt. cooper steps toward him.
i saw the same tracks outside the power station. weight
shift to the left foot. a break in the heel.
windom earle.
what would earle be doing here?
that's a frightening question to contemplate.
andy. i need an accurate, large scale rendering of this
painting. harry, we need to speak to major briggs
immediately.
whatever you say, coop. i'll call from the jeep.
cooper nods assent. truman exits. hawk steps to andy, casts additional light upon the
painting as the deputy draws and copies. copper pivots, gazes at the mysterious image. as if
to wonder where it might lead him.

start close on windom earle. seated in an armchair, pipe in hand, avuncular in
aspect, he begins:
once upon a time, there was a place of great goodness
called the white lodge. fawns gamboled there amidst
happy laughing spirits. the sounds of innocence and
laughter filled the air. when it rained it rained sweet
nectar that paralyzed the heart with the desire to live
one's life in truth and beauty.
generally speaking, a ghastly place reeking of virtue's
sour smell, engorged with the whispered prayers of
kneeling mothers, mewling newborns, and fools young
and old compelled to do good without reason. but, i
am pleased to note, our story does not end in this place
of saccharine excess.
as he speaks, camera pans from earle, travels toward his unseen audience, revealing
leo johnson seated cross-legged on the floor, as if listening to a bedtime story.
for there is another place, its opposite, of almost
unimaginable power, chock full of dark forces and
vicious secrets. no prayers dare penetrate this frightful
maw. spirits there care not for good deeds and priestly
invocations. they are as like to rip the muscle from
our bones as greet you with a happy g'day. and, if
harnessed, these spirits, this hidden land of unmuffled
screams and broken hearts, will offer up a power so vast
that its bearer might reorder the earth itself to his liking.
this place i speak of, is known as the black lodge. and
i intend to find it.
camera continues to pan, reveals a dull-witted youth seated at leo's school
desk. long stringy hair, head band, a vacant stare. some sullen refugee from a speed metal
talent show.
listen, man. the story's cool. but you promised me
beer. besides, you told me there was gonna be a party up
here. black lodge, white lodge, like what's the big
deal?
camera concludes its move, holds on earle's computer screen, where we see a
computer rendering of the hieroglyph from owl cave.

i think i shall never see, a girl as lovely as josie, when she

pete's poetic reverie is interrupted when catherine martell storms into the room.
she's carrying the mysterious black box eckhardt gave her.
pete! stop your incessant moping and give me a hand
with this damn box.
what exactly do you want me to do?
open it. i've been trying all morning. thomas
eckhardt left this box to me when he died. i want it
opened and i want it opened now.
well ... let's take a look-see... do you have a key?
if i had a key, it would be be open already, don't you
think?
#2.019
'course there's no key hole...
(he plays with the sides and edges of the box,
pieces that interact as if part of a larger puzzle)
it's a puzzle box. saw one of these at a crafts emporium
in guam. i was taking a little r and r with the
doolittle twins, there was this monkey show that you
wouldn't believe, and dale doolittle, he was the larger
of the two, come to think of it, for twins they didn't
look at all alike...
pete!!!
sorry, poodle.
the trick is to fit the pieces together just so...
yes. and how long is that going to take?
pete concentrates on the puzzle box, brow furrowed, lips pursed. a long beat.
this could take years.

sorry. i've got a police cruiser full of hungry lawmen
waiting in the parking lot. a box of donuts, to go. and
a cup of hot coffee for the road.

without a goodbye. then, at last, he turns to face her.
you're beautiful, shelly. got it? so take advantage.
bobby makes her feel like it's a curse. bobby exits. shelly sighs, quotes:
what is all this sweet work worth, if thou kiss not me?
shelly turns to see cooper staring at her. he looks as though he's seen a ghost.
what did you say?
someone sent me a poem. it was anonymous.
i need to see that poem immediatley, shelly. please.

shelly reaches under the counter, retrieves her purse. she hands her third of the poem to
cooper. he inspects it.
we each got a piece. donna, audrey, and me.
i'll have to take this with me.
shelly nods assent. annie returns bearing donuts and coffee.
one dozen to go. cup of coffee.

cooper pays in a hurry, turns for the door without another word.
agent cooper...?

shelly and annie. they exchange a look, wonder what's on his mind.

open on deputy andy in the station conference room. he stands at the blackboard,
painstakingly reproduces the cave painting upon it. andy erases, alters, draws primitive lines
on the slate.
sheriff truman's office
agent cooper and sheriff truman confer in the latter's office. truman examines the poem
fragment shelly gave to cooper.
mountains kiss... waves clasp... what's this all about,
coop?
it's part of a poem, torn into thirds. sent to shelly
johnson, audrey horne, and donna hayward... by
windom earle.
earle's contacted all three? are you sure?
see the mountains kiss high heaven
and the waves clasp one another;
no sister-flower would be forgiven
if it disdained its brother...
i sent this same poem to caroline once.
i don't like the sound of this.
it may be nothing more than a taunt. earle takes a sick
pride in his ability to insinuate himself into innocent lives.
and if it's not?
let's talk to the girls as soon as possible. see what they
recall.
deputy hawk enters.
#2.019
major briggs is here. conference room.
donna hayward's poem. audrey horne is in seattle
until tomorrow.
cooper opens the envelope, removes another fragment, aligns it with the first on truman's
desk. he peers at the poem for a beat, preoccupied, an idea forming. hawk turns to exit.
hawk?
bring me leo johnson's arrest report. anything that
might have his handwriting on it.
hawk, nods, exits. truman wonders:
what's the connection?
there isn't one. yet.
major briggs watches deputy andy transcribe the cave painting with fascination. as andy
connects two figures, the major suddenly interrupts:
deputy brennan? as i remember, the line you are
drawing should proceed downward, not across.
andy checks the original rendering on his sketch pad. andy erases, redraws. then it hits him.
he turns to major briggs, mystified.
how did you know that?
cooper and truman enter.
major briggs. we need your help. yet i find it
difficult to accurately describe why or how.
go on.
#2.019
the twin peaks sheriffs department is currently
involved in several disparate investigations. the
disappearance of a known felon, leo johnson. the
appearance of my former partner, a murderer, windom
earle. and the discovery of an ancient hieroglyph in a
place called owl cave.
logic demands that these investigations remain separate
entities. but recent developments suggest otherwise. i
believe that these mysteries are not separate entities, but
are in fact complimentary verses of the same song. i
cannot hear the song yet, major briggs. but i can feel it.
and that is enough for me to proceed.
as a military man, i am familiar with damage done by
blind adherence to logic. how exactly may i help you?
i need to know everything there is to know about
windom earle's work with project blue book.
that would involve accessing classified air force
computer files.
yes, it would.
my security clearance was revoked shortly after my
disappearance.
and your ability to access the blue book files?
the issue is not one of access. there are, however,
certain moral judgements i must consider.
of course.
will this information help you to prevent future loss of
life?
yes.
#2.019
can you gain this intelligence without my intervention?
no.
pause. briggs rises, steps to the blackboard. andy's rendering of the cave painting upon it.
is this a copy of the hieroglyph you found in owl cave?
yes. do you know it?
i have dreamed it. or seen it. somewhere. somehow.
briggs stares at the hieroglyph for a long beat. then turns to face cooper and the rest.
i will do what you ask.
deputy hawk enters with a file, hands it to cooper.
leo johnson's arrest report.
cooper takes the file, opens it. he finds examples of johnson's handwriting. as the others
look on, cooper arrays the sample next to the poem fragments. as he works:
the damage leo suffered would no doubt alter certain
handwriting characteristics. but his basic style remains
the same...
this poem, sent by windom earle, was transcribed by
leo johnson.
leo's working for earle?
yes. or is his captive.
hold on this tableau for a beat. cooper, truman, hawk, andy, and major briggs. the
evidence before them. verses to the same song.

drink up, friend. we celebrate.
leo carries the beer to the youth, now revealed inside a huge papier mache chess piece.
celebrate? i can barely move my arms.
leo carefully puts the can to the youth's lips, offers a hearty swallow. earle places the last few
pieces upon the wire frame, effectively encasing the heavy metal youth inside.
you have lived your short life in odium and obscurity.
but now, at the end, you will step upon the larger stage.

beyond imagining. who knows where you might travel

not a parade, my friend. not exactly.
well i'm real cool about helpin' out and everything. but
how do i get out of this thing?
you don't.
earle reaches into a chest, produces a wooden bow. he turns to leo, orders.
leo. fetch me an arrow.
leo pauses - he's been feeding beer to the youth all along - turns to regard him.
arrow. whoa, man. i do not appreciate practical jokes.
leo. the arrow.
leo sets the can of beer upon a table, faces earle. and does not move. he manages:
n.... no.
earle doesn't hesitate. he grabs the shock collar remote, presses the appropriate button. leo
shivers and falls, struck down by its power.
jeez, don't zap the geek. how'm i supposed to get my
beer without...
earle zaps leo a second time, lifting him clear of the floor. leo moans, crawls to his knees.
oh, dude ... that's gotta hurt...
fetch me... an arrow.

leo staggers, stands. and walks to a basket near his makeshift bed. he retrieves an arrow -
whittled to perfection, armed with a wicked steel point - and brings it back to earle.
arrow...
thank you, leo.
earle turns back to the papier mache chess piece, the youth trapped inside.
what's with the arrow, man... what are you doing?! this
isn't funny, man. this is not funny.
please. be still.
what the hell are you doing...?!?
think of all the hapless sinners, wondering where their
soul's destination lies? think of the prayers and the
doubt, the gut-sucking fear that visits late at night. and
for what? to gain the answer to a simple question.
where will my spirit wake? what life am i given after
my life? this grave question has plagued man's sorry
conscience for eons. and you, lucky boy, have the
answer... now.
earle unleashes the arrow, it tears through the air, pierces the heart of the papier mache
chess piece... and the heart of the heavy metal youth inside.
the arrow buried up to the hilt. a small trickle of blood seeping from the hole it makes.
watching the later with undisguised shock and horror. wakened from one nightmare to
another.

shelly receives him without hesitation. cooper looks on with a smile: the whole world is in
love. just then: bobby briggs enters, stops and stares.
what the hell is going on here...?
cole breaks from the kiss, regards the angry youth, grins.

moment, what does it look like?
poor kid acts like he never saw a kiss before.
watch closely, son. it goes like this.
gordon...
too late. cole kisses shelly again, with gusto. bobby watches, open-mouthed, stunned
silent. who is this guy?

establish.
doc hayward, eileen, and donna at dinner. the mood is quietly tense, nobody willing to say
what's on their mind. food is passed, plates filled. but little is eaten.
would you pass the peas, donna?
mom, can i ask you a question?
sure.
donna...
how well do you know ben horne?
eileen, i told donna about the heal the planet benefit
you re working on.
heal the planet...?
with ben horne.
i was here when he came to the house. you went to see
him yesterday.
oh. well, yes. ben has offered some of his time.
#2.019 30.
i know he favors several of the local charities.
maybe the charity sent mom's roses.
i put them by the bed.
roses. that's nice.
donna, would you pass the peas?
i think roses are romantic, don't you?
donna, pass your mother the peas.
how's school?
just great. all the girls are real excited about miss
twin peaks.
it's a fine tradition. i've worked with the pageant for
years.
i entered.
really? but you never...
why not? i could use the scholarship money to study
overseas.
she means away from here. eileen and doc exchange a look. donna simmers between.
still wearing the cumbersome nose bandage, dick tremayne taps a wine glass with a knife,
calling the wine tasting party to order. a dozen or so people sit in the bar area, including ben
#2.019 31.
horne, andy, lucy, lana budding and a few of the models from the fashion show. everyone
has two wine glasses in front of them and a spit bucket. on the table in front of dick are a
number of wine bottles, covered in bags.
good evening. evening all. welcome to our
oenophiliac soiree, another in a continuing series of
public events, sponsored by horne industries, to benefit
the stop ghostwood development movement.
ono-what?
something to do with wine.
when my good friend, ben horne, asked me how would
i like to contribute to the good fight, i said to myself,
dick, i said, you're a former sommelier why not try to
bring a little culture to the proceedings? i replied ... but
of course: a wine-tasting parry. uplift the general level
of quality of life at the same time we're putting money
into the fight to save our trees. voila!
i should of course mention that our wines this evening are
all courtesy of the great northern's wine cellar, thank
you, ben, and now ... to the tasting! lana, lucy, if you'd
help me pour, please.
lana and lucy jump up to help him pour out the contents of the first tasting. dick flirts rather
obviously with lana, which lucy can't fail to notice. she simmers as she pours.
our first wines tonight are reds. there are some schools
of thought who of course say there are no other wines but
reds.
andy raises his hand.
yes, andy.
there are also white wines and sparkling wines.
#2.019
thank you, andy.
very good, lana.
don't pour quite so much, lucy.
another cold look from lucy to lana and dick.
now that we're all poured, let's first examine -
don't taste it, yet, andy, for heaven's sake.
andy has a mouthful of wine.
spit it out.
andy spits into the bucket.
sorry.
that's all right. that's what we're here for: to learn.
now, to the wine. first we must examine the nose of the
wine, to see what it can tell about its bouquet. and
we do that by ...
by smelling.
very good, lana.
another look from lucy.
lift the glass thusly ...
and while vigorously rolling the wine around in the
glass, we breathe deeply and fully.
unbeknownst to him, the wine seeps into the gauze bandage on tremayne's nose and a crimson
blotch starts to creep cellularly upwards.

that's good. now, procedurally, we take our first
taste, a big, boisterous gulp and roll it energetically
around our entire palate, trying to involve those hard to
reach taste buds, tucked away in the back of our tongues.
remembering not to swallow ...
the class takes a sip and rolls it around in their mouths.
excellent. and now ... we ... spit.
as one, the group spits noisily into their buckets.
by the fireplace in the other room, jack wheeler enters and sits near a pensive dale cooper,
nursing a drink, staring into the fire. a beat. wheeler emits a rueful sigh, thinking of audrey.
a beat. cooper allows a happy little whistle of satisfaction. he's thinking about annie. a
beat. wheeler sighs again. cooper whistles. both gradually aware of the other. then, at last,
more to himself:
love is hell.
sorry?
love. it's hell.
the hindus say love is the ladder to heaven.
we're both right.
"proof of heaven, while we're living."
the hindus have also been known to take a hike on hot
coals for recreational purposes.
self-discipline.
#2.019 34.
self- discipline and love are a bad match.
earthly love.
what other kind is there?
when you're in it, none.
it hits you like an eighteen-wheeler. and there's no
relief.
it makes you feel more alive.
and you feel more of everything. pain included.
pain especially.
can't think of anything but her.
no.
she goes away, it's like a part of you's ripped out of its
socket.
sounds like you've got a pretty serious case.
i am roped, tied and branded.
she feel the same way?
here's hoping.

#2.019 35.
cooper lifts his drink in support.
how 'bout you? you on the critical list, too?
i feel like someone's taken a crowbar to my heart.
that's not bad.
no. i think maybe it's been locked away long enough.
then that's good.
here's hoping.
here's to you.
they drink. a beat. a voice interrupts:
mr. wheeler, telegram for you, sir.
a bellman holds out a telegram. wheeler takes it, tips him. he opens the telegram. we
see it's from brazil. grim news.
damn.
bellman?
the bellman stops, turns to regard him.
tell the desk i'll be checking out. thanks.
the bellman exits. wheeler collects his thoughts, rises.
good night.

cooper nods, watches as wheeler steps away.
the wine-tasting continues. dick is hovering over lana.
all right, class, what did that sip reveal to us? what
flavors are we enjoying?
tastes kind of woody.
no, not really. anyone else? lana?
banana?
yes, there is a hint of banana, that's the metachloric acid,
very good. what else?
revised 1-31-91, cherry
#2.019 36.
banana.
chocolate.
correct, andy, there is another acid, hydroxinine, which
is present in both flavors.
why don't we just skip the wine and have a banana split?
registering, lucy's mood, dick pours more into lana's glass, doting on her.
let's have another sip, shall we, swallowing this time
and let's see what else we can discern.
gosh, dick, i never knew wine could have so many
different qualities.
amazing, isn't it a really fine wine is like a
symphony. strings, woodwinds, brass, percussion,
they're all present, playing in harmony.
everyone sips. dick turns to lucy with a prefunctory tone.
and what reaction do you have lucy?
she spits the wine out in his face.
i'm pregnant. i'm not supposed to drink.
they look at each other.

police cars. cops. lights trained on the gazebo, where a large box sits in the center. cooper
drives up, is greeted by truman. they move towards the gazebo.
we thought at first it might be a bomb. we don't
exactly have a bomb squad. it's weird.
what did you do?
andy brought his metal detector. if it is a bomb it's
not metallic and there's no ticking sound, so...
be careful, coop, i think it is meant for you.
i doubt it harry. windom is too precise. this will
have to do with some other itinerary on his peculiar
journey. when he tries to kill me it will be face to face
and far removed from chicanery or subtrafuge.
cooper moves confidently up to the gazebo. finds a small rope emerging from the top, with
a ring attached and a sign that reads, 'pull me."
let's see what he's up to.
he pull the ring. a moment later all four sides of the box begin to fall to the ground.
get back!
cooper doesn't move as the box falls apart. revealed inside is a large black, papier-mache
chess piece, a pawn. sticking out of the top is the very dead head of windom earle's victim.
a sign on the pawn reads, "next time. it will be someone you know."
