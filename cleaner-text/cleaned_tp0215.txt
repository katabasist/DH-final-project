mrs. marsh hired him to fix the jaguar.
how did you meet him, mrs. marsh?
jeffrey's jaguar broke down near wally's. i went inside
to use the phone and he offered to help.

evelyn turns her back on him. malcolm laughs and walks up the stairs.
james and donna slide quietly, nervously into a booth in the bar.
we can't get out of this by ourselves, james. we've got
to get someone to help us.
but i didn't do anything. malcolm killed mr. marsh.
i'm being framed
it doesn't make any difference. we can't just wait for
cops to catch us. i think you should call big ed.
no, my only chance is to talk to evelyn. if she told me
this was a set up, maybe she'll tell the police, too.
you wouldn't have a chance. the police will be waiting
for you. we've got to keep moving.

ed, it's donna. i don't have much time. james is in lots
of trouble. he was working for this woman, repairing a
car and there was an accident - james thinks -
the cop from the marsh house enters the bar. donna stares at the cop and then at james who
also watches the cop. james slides out of the bar. donna is about to run after him when the
cop moves suspiciously towards her. she changes the subject.
- so, tell me about your new boyfriend, janie - he's
really cure, isn't he? he lettered in football? what
position does he play?
the cop walks over to the bartender. they are obviously talking about james. move back

have been for a long time, since before laura died.
before and after leo went into his drool mode.
bobby, where were you the night the mill burned?
what's that got to do with this?
leo tried to kill you. maybe you shot him that night.
no way. i went to shelly's house the night of the fire
because i was worried about her. leo was waiting for
me. he was about to play paul bunyan on me when hank
jennings shot him through the window.
you sure it was hank?

as shelly and bobby leave they bump into albert rosenfield in the doorway.
cooper is genuinely happy to see him.

gordon cole. as he so succinctly put it,
"i'm worried about coop.
(spreads out a map, pointing out a pattern
marked on it)

chicago. earle's been sending gift wrapped packages to
police departments and offices of major law
enforcement agencies. each look like mail bombs, but
turn out to be harmless. deliveries are paid for with
phony credit cards signed "windom earle." cole's

he's got the dea, fbi, treasury, postal service and
the mississippi, oklahoma, and illinois state patrols
looking for him. invited all of them to the party, but
my guess is he won't dance with anyone but you, coop.
cooper is unnerved. albert retrieves more work from his case.
the vagrant in the office died from a knife wound
severing the aorta. he'd been dead for two days.
but it's finger was pointing to the chess board? how did
he manage that with the rigamortis?
rigamortis goes from head to toe but after two days
leaves the body toe to head. earle waited for it to leave
the arms and fingers so that he could maneuver them on
the chess board.
and then he played zeus at the power station.
how do you know?
he left us this map. taped under a table.

cooper moves away from the map. stares our the window. albert worries for his friend.
he's making his move. most definitely.
albert moves to the door. tries to cheer cooper up.
about the uniform, coop. replacing the elegance of the
dark suit and tie with the casual indifference of a mouse
brown work outfit is a form of fashion suicide, but, call
me crazy, i like it.
albert goes out. truman studies the frightened cooper.
leo johnson in bed with his wounds from the night before freshly dressed. windom
earle sits next to him playing an antique wooden flute. five stainless steel square suitcases
rest near him. the chess board is set up on the table. a small school desk sits by the door.
on one wall is a earle's high tech command module - computer, modem, monitoring
devices, police scanners. leo awakes to the haunting flute music.
ah, you are awake, then.
i trust you've slept well.

"drug trafficking, arson, attempted murder."
"domestic violence." i'm partial to that.
leo tries to make a bolt for the door. earle slams his wound with his flute. leo falls back.
well, leo, i have cleansed your wounds. you're on the
mend. i've removed the proverbial thorn from your paw.
leo. leo the lion.
i want you to help me. and obey me. will you do
that?
leo hesitates. earle shows the flute to leo.
in thirteenth century japan the samurai were stripped of
their weaponry. but they discovered that the aged and
treated bamboo of their shaku hachi flute made an
excellent cudgel.
this flute is truly an instrument of pleasure, don't you
think?
leo tries to make a run for it, but merely allows earle to have more fun with his flute. it ends
with earle standing over leo near the doorway. he takes a dog collar out of his coat.
i wanted to save this necklace for an "occasion," but now
you've ruined it.
he wraps the collar around leo's neck. attached is a round object that looks like a beer can.
now, come over here. i've made you some gruel.
as earle returns to the table, leo scrambles for the door. he stops short. struggling with an
electrical shock coming from the collar. he falls backwards. stunned. earle sits at his table.
come here, leo. come on.
leo struggles towards the table as earle plays his flute.

almost twenty years, norma. one day we're talking
about a graduation party and the next day we're here. in

i tried not to think about it. spent more and more time
in the diner trying to make the place work because there
was nothing else. we were open everyday so that i
wouldn't have another life. no birthdays, no fourth of
july, no christmas.
i turned all my christmases into a week full of
mondays. when that didn't work i'd spend my time
thinking about presents i never got to buy you. never got
to give you.
i bought you a present last christmas. an onyx and
turquoise bolo tie. i walked over to your house to give it
to you, but i just stood there and waited to see you
through a window. i should have just walked right in. i
don't know why i didn't. i'm sorry i didn't.

bed.
it's about the future now, ed, and what we are going to

serving tray. another angle reveals josie in the kitchen, carrying the tray toward the
living room. josie steps toward catherine and eckhardt seated at the large circular dinner
table. they converse, run forks through salads on fine china.
i must confess i received your invitation with some
surprise.
word travels fast in twin peaks. it seemed fitting that
i dine with my late brother's business rival. some wine,

eckhardt listens to catherine's charter, now looks up at josie as she steps toward them
your brother was not always my rival. we were friends.
andrew was a witty, intelligent, and charming man.
plaudits no doubt employed to describe his sister as well.

of a sort. your brother was as well.
i wonder, mister eckhardt. when you had him killed,
was it for art or money? don't stand there, josie, pour.
josie nearly drops her bottle of wine. but eckhardt betrays no reaction. he simply turns his
gaze from josie to catherine. catherine's playing a dangerous game. eckhardt will play
along ... for now. josie pours blood-red wine into crystal glasses with a shaking hand.
call me thomas. your brother did.

one does not kill for art or money. they are
commodities easily lost, but just as easily gained.
however, one -
- rather, i, would find reason to kill for love.
did you love her that much?
josie returns, offering a tray of canapes. eckhardt's tone has been cratonic throughout. but now
he pauses. looks at josie. takes a small confection from the tray. and speaks quietly:
yes.
eckhardt pops the canape in his mouth. josie nearly drops the tray. catherine speaks evenly, as

i wonder. what shall we do with her now?
you've come so far to twin peaks. it would be a shame
to leave us empty-handed.
it would.

untrustworthy. she'll betray you again. and again.
i have managed to find pleasure in even that repetition.
of course i'll miss her cheery disposition. we've

that's not exactly what you want to hear, is it, james?

james stares into her eyes. evelyn moves closer. the truth hurts her too:
you're good and you're honest. i'm not. but that doesn't
mean there weren't moments when i truly wanted you
here. not for the money or for malcom. but for me.

it...james steps toward evelyn's arms.
i wanted you too.

they exchange a gentle kiss. a beat. footsteps behind them, a sudden leap ... and
malcolm appears, strikes james on the head. james slips to the floor, lies
still. evelyn looks at his inert form with shock, then to malcolm.
malcolm speaks quietly, words for evelyn to commit to memory. her story, her alibi, a tale
to be told to the police.
james broke into the house. he was angry, he was crazy.
he killed jeffrey and now he came back to kill you. a
poor, helpless widow. but you were ready for him,
evelyn. you got your gun ... and you shot james until he
was dead.
hold on evelyn for a beat. malcolm before her. james helpless on the floor.

a fire burns in the hearth casting warm light about the cabin. windom earle peers into a
mirror, carefully affixes a false mustache to his face, other concealing facial hair. he speaks
aloud as he prepares his disguise:
work slowly and with care. everything must be written
in a steady, uncompromising hand.
leo sits at a small wooden school desk, concentrates on a piece of writing paper before him.
he painstakingly copies from an open book of poetry, produces a version in his own hand. the
shock-collar still hangs about his neck. earle steps behind him, peers over leo's shoulder. he
uses his flute as a yard stick or marker.
no, no, no. terrible.
erase.
earle produces the shock collar control, presses a button. a low-grade shock shivers
through leo's body. leo reacts with a shudder. then erases in haste, looks up at earle with
plaintive expression.
now. try again. concentrate.
leo looks back to the paper. as if it was responsible for the shocks that course through him.
he puts pen to paper. but he errs again.
oh, leo. for heaven's sake.
another stinging shock. leo turns, as if to flee. but earle is upon him. he grabs leo's hand in
an iron grip.
let me show you.
earle guides leo's hand to the paper. and carefully leads him through the difficult section.
there is something odd and tender about earle's actions. as teacher to pupil. father to son.

finish.
a beat. leo proceeds, afraid, but more determined somehow. earle watches with satisfaction
as leo completes the unseen document. he gives leo a friendly pat on the head.
i am proud of you, leo.
leo looks up it earle, eager to curry his favor, whispers.
windom ... earle...
yes. windom.
earle picks up leo's work. three child-like valentines. in the center of each heart is
a picture: shelly, donna, and aubrey. they are surveillance photos. leo has written their
names on each valentine.
pretty words for pretty girls. which one will be my
queen?
queen ...
earle carefully tears the page into vertical thirds . leo reacts with a protesting groan.
no...
earle looks at him sharply. leo cowers at his school-desk. earle produces three identical
envelopes, one for each torn third.

a surreal tableau follows. grant's surrender as enacted by ben horne (as the victorious general
lee), dr. jacoby (as the vanquished general grant), jerry horne (as wilmer mclean), aubrey
(as daughter mclean) and bobby (as the miserable bugle boy).
ben pauses, midroom, surveys the small table at its center, the players grouped about him.
aubrey steps forward with a smile.
welcome to our humble home, general lee.
thank you. you are ...?
scarlett mclean. this is my father.
aubrey gestures toward jerry in his farmer's suit. but jerry misses his cue, stands frozen with
stage fright. so aubrey repeats:
this is my father.
jerry reacts, hurries forward, still clutching ben's sword.
wilmer mclean at your service. i'm indeed honored to
make your extremely suitable acquaintance.
why are you armed with my sword?
i ... like your sword. sire.
ben frowns, surrounded by idiots no matter which universe he inhabits. aubrey ushers jerry to
the side.
#2.015 35.
thank you, daddy.
where is general grant?
general grant's a-comin', sire. i know'd it.
an awkward beat. jacoby remains in hiding. someone's missed their cue. jerry looks at
aubrey. aubrey frowns, shoots a look at bobby. bobby plays a hasty toot on the bugle. the
cue jacoby's been waiting for. a beat. and he steps forward, with as much diginity as
stepping from behind a curtain allows, into the room. ben reacts to the odd entrance, ignores
it. and extends a hand.
general grant.
general lee.
please, gentlemen. sit down.
she gestures toward the small round table. they sit.
we once met during the mexican war. do you
remember?
(calling upon high school drama training,
sticking to the script)
i have come to surrender the north.
ben reacts. is he the only sane man in the room?
the mexican war. do you remember?
it was a good war as i remember.
nonsense. all wars are nothing more than madness
#2.015 36.
disguised as the patriotic ventures of politicians too old
or cowardly to participate in them. i have no love of
war. and even less for politicians.
me neither.
but as for the men who fight them...
well. they have my eternal respect and sympathy.
very well, general. enough fruitless conversation. my
terms. federal officers may keep their side arms and
general possessions. officers and men claiming to own
horses may keep them too. and each officer and man
will be allowed to return to his home, not to be
disturbed by the confederate states' authorities.
i surrender.
ben pauses. rewriting history wasn't supposed to be like this. he sighs.
of course you do. the articles ... ?
ben looks about, no paper on the desk. jerry hurries forward, having missed his cue.
the articles, sire.
sir.
sir.
general grant. you will sign?
yes.
#2.015 37.
and may i add that you have been a valiant opponent of
both noble bearing and fine character. qualities happily
reflected in the hearts and minds of your brave men.
thank you.
jacoby signs. he hands the pen to ben. ben signs as well. jerry reveals a harmonica, begins to
play the battle hymn of the republic in the background.
bobby and audrey look on from the perimeter. bobby turns to aubrey.
i thought the north won the civil war...
aubrey rolls her eyes. ben and jacoby stand, shake hands a second time. jerry steps closer,
playing loudly now. ben gets fully into the spirit of the moment, tears gather in his eyes, he's
at the pinnacle again, he's triumphed over inestimable odds ... and faints dead away.
daddy!
jerry, jacoby, and aubrey gather about the fallen general. jacoby loosens his collar. bobby
stands just behind them.
give him room.
ben!
daddy, can you hear me? daddy?
a beat. then, a long last, ben's eyes flutter ... and open. he speaks:
where am i?
twin peaks.
i had the strangest dream. you were there, and you, and you...

who are you?
bobby briggs. sir.
oh.
it was incredible. there was a war. and i was a
general. general lee. and somehow, despite
incredible odds against me, i won. it ... well. i know
it's impossible. but you were all there. and i was too.
bur you're back now, daddy. you're home.
yes. i am.
atta boy, ben.
how do you feel? any aftereffects. dizziness?
to tell you the truth...
i feel terrific. i feel like...
yes ...?
what is it, daddy?
what in the world are you doing in those clothes?
jerry does a little impromptu dance of celebration. aubrey hugs her father. dr. jacoby sits
back on his heels, still wearing his tattered uniform. bobby plays a rolling figure on his
trumpet.

camera tracks toward the house, a moving pov, now peering through a window
inside. evelyn kneels by james on the floor. malcom enters the living room carrying a pistol in his
right hand. another angle reveals donna looking through the window, reacting to the
horrifying scene within.
malcom holds the gun toward evelyn, grip-end first.
the story rings a little truer with your fingerprints on the
gun.
no. i can't...
just your prints. leave the rest to me.
malcom forces the gun into evelyn's hand. then produces a glove, slips it on his right hand.
i'll do my best to imitate the actions of a hysteric. five
shots, tightly grouped. like the gun went off in your
hand. repeatedly.
glove on, malcom holds out his hand for the gun. but evelyn hesitates, steps back from him.
evelyn...?
just then: donna races into the living room.
no!!
malcom whirls about. donna races to james, kneels to hold him in her arms. to protect him
from further harm. james stirs, barely conscious.
donna...?
don't hurt him. please. don't hurt him anymore.
#2.015 40.
the gun, evelyn.
i called the police. they're coming. you'll never get
away with this...
malcom...
she's lying. give me the gun.
don't do it. please don't let us die.
evelyn.
no.
malcom whirls about. finds evelyn gawking fondly at the young lovers. the gun held tightly
in her hand.
i can't do it. i won't.
there is a transcendant determination in her voice. a soul reclaimed. malcom darkens.
i will.
he steps forward, means to wrest the gun from evelyn's hands. but evelyn fires, a bullet
slams into malcom's chest. he staggers, looks down at the wound with surprise. he steps
toward evelyn, the gun smoking in her outstretched hand. but his legs fail him. malcom
staggers, malcom falls dead to the floor. a beat. donna weeps, cradles james in her arms.
evelyn drops the gun. and in a voice totally devoid of emotion, begins to recite the story
malcom taught her.
he was angry, he was crazy. he killed jeffrey and he
came back to kill me. but i was ready for him. i got
my gun. and i shot him. i shot him until he was dead...
a distant siren wails.

a man pauses in the hotel lobby. it is windom earle in disguise. earle looks about, reacts. he
sees agent cooper step into view. earle walks quickly to a pillar nearby, hides behind it.
meanwhile, cooper steps through the lobby after a long day. he walks past earle in hiding,
continues. then reacts, as if he'd felt someone's eyes upon him. cooper turns, takes a closer
look... but there is no one to be seen. earle has moved on. cooper shrugs, steps inside the
waiting elevator.
a beat. earle steps to reception, pleased with his subterfuge. he watches the elevator door
close, turns to hand an envelope to the night clerk.
for miss aubrey horne.
cooper enters his room, removes jacket and gun. then he pauses, notices something ahead. a
strange shape beneath his bedspread where the pillow lies. cooper steps closer, carefully pulls
it back.
a plaster deathmask has been set upon his pillow. the face of a beautiful woman. caroline.
cooper stares at the mask for a long, long beat. his heart floods with sad memory. then,
careful not to break it, cooper lifts the mask off his bed. beneath it ... a small tape recorder,
now activated by the mask's removal. cooper reacts, waits. and hears the familiar voice
of windom earle.
earle's voice
breathtaking, wasn't she? a truly beautiful woman,
caroline. funny, after all this time, after all that
happened in pittsburgh ... i still love her. and i know
that you do too ...
now, dale. listen carefully. it's your move ...
