ACT ONE
FADE IN:
1. INT. SHERIFF TRUMAN'S OFFICE - NIGHT
Close on the fibers of a fabric tape. We slowly pull back revealing that it is the tape covering
the mouth of the DEAD MAN. A surgical gloved hand reaches into the frame and slowly
pulls the tape off the mouth, inside the mouth attached to the tape is a black chess piece - a
pawn. We pull back to DOC HAYWARD, AGENT COOPER.
HAYWARD
Good Lord.
Cooper reaches in, removes the chess piece and examines it: it's a match to the pieces on the
chess board set up on the table. HARRY enters the room.
TRUMAN
No one saw a thing. The blackout and fire drew
everyone out of the building.
COOPER
Andy, we'll need this dusted for prints ...
Cooper drops the chess piece in a bag and hands it to ANDY standing inside the door with his
eyes closed so he won't see the body and cry. He reaches out for the bag, misses it. Truman
puts it in Andy's hand. Andy turns to leave and walks into to the wall with a thud. Andy peeks,
adjusts his trajectory and makes it.
TRUMAN
How long has he been dead, Doc?
HAYWARD
Hard to tell; we'll need an autopsy.
COOPER
Doc, open the victim's shirt. I believe you will find an
incision, a stab wound one inch beneath the sternum,
penetrating upwards, severing the aorta.
Hayward and Truman exchange a look then Doc opens the shirt. Cooper was right.
TRUMAN
You've seen this before.
COOPER
(nods, examines the floor)
No blood stains.

Cooper picks a pine needle up off the floor. Then walks to the middle windowsill, examines
with magnifier. HAWK comes in the door.
COOPER
Hawk, footprints?
HAWK
Two sets, same boots; one coming, one leaving. Heavier
impressions on the way down.
COOPER
Carrying the body.
TRUMAN
We should get molds made of those before it rains.
COOPER
He'll have been wearing the wrong size shoe, untraceable
and already destroyed.
HAWK
I followed them to the granite stream up the ridge, lost
them on the rocks.
COOPER
He knows how to mask a trail ... any cars stolen in town
recently?
TRUMAN
There was one a couple of days ago, from the Cash and
Carry on Sparkwood. No witnesses. Cooper, you're
sure Windom Earle's behind this?
Cooper nods, steps to the window, looks into the darkness.
COOPER
A short time ago, a vagrant ... our victim was befriended
and offered a lift. He was given some cheap wine and a
cigarette. The victim was then driven to a location up
behind the ridge, you'll find the car still up there. He
was stabbed, once, managed to run at least fifty yards,
cutting his hands and face on brush before collapsing.
Earle engineered the explosion that caused the power
failure, created the diversionary fire that drew everyone
outside the station, then brought the body in through this
window.
(turns, Faces them)
Windom Earle has been in this room. I can still feel his
presence. There aren't going to be any fingerprints in

here, Harry. No slip-ups, oversights, no mistakes.
Everything he does has its own rationale, precision and
intelligence. Windom Earle is a genius. And he's taken
his first pawn. In a very sick game.

3. INT. GREAT NORTHERN LOBBY - NIGHT
AUDREY and BOBBY sit at a small round table. The power is out. Candlelight illuminates
the scene. They have drinks between them. Plus a bucket of ice. Audrey drops a few cubes
into Bobby's glass and a few into hers.
AUDREY
Listen carefully, Bobby Briggs, here's what we're gonna
do. If I have learned anything from my father before he
flipped his wig it's that a business relationship is a
sacred pact, equaled only by the closest of personal
relationships ... where nothing is held back.
BOBBY
Right.
AUDREY
Do you want to get rich, Bobby?
BOBBY
Immediately.
AUDREY
Maybe I can help. This is the last of the ice cubes till the
power comes back on.
She reaches over and picks an ice cube out of Bobby's drink.
AUDREY
Now, pretend this is my father.
She closes her hand around it.
BOBBY
An ice cube?

AUDREY
Right. And our job now is to help my father find his
way back from Limbo-Land so he doesn't melt away and
leave me with a handful of nothing.
She reopens her hand, the cube is melted.
AUDREY
We wouldn't want that to happen, would we?
BOBBY
No.
AUDREY
From now on Bobby I'm the one you suck up to.
She licks up the melted water.
BOBBY
(a moment of conscience)
What about Shelly?
AUDREY
What about Shelly?
Bobby's eyes grow stalks. He finishes his drink.

5. INT. LEO JOHNSON'S HOUSE - NIGHT
POV, moving frantically through the darkened kitchen into the living room and to the door.
We pull back, SHELLY desperately tries to open the door but it's been locked from the out
side.
SHELLY
(screaming)
No!
She looks back into the kitchen, it's pitch black, she can't see a thing.

SHELLY
(pleading)
Oh, God ... please no.
The sound of a creaking wheel on the wheelchair is heard.
SHELLY
Leo?
Out of the darkness comes Leo's wheelchair directly toward her, it knocks over a lamp, comes
closer and closer. She jumps out of the way as it crashes into the door. Shelly starts for a
window, something flies through the air and lands at her feet. She freezes; a bar of soap in a
sock lays on the floor. A guttural laugh rises out of the darkness.
SHELLY
Don't do this, Leo.
From the darkness comes.
LEO
(slurred, and bursting with pride that he's e's back)
Le...O. Le...O.
The refrigerator door swings open. The light from inside illuminates a grinning crazed-
looking LEO.
LEO
F-u-n-s o-v-e-r.
Leo laughs again. The refrigerator slowly closes. From the darkness comes the sound of a foot
dragging across the floor. Shelly makes a break for it, out of the darkness Leo's hand grabs
Shelly by the neck, pulls her close to him.
LEO
Le-o go-od.
He smiles, then throws her across the table, sending her and everything on the table crashing
into the corner.
LEO
Fu-n.
Leo shuffles toward Shelly, his left leg and arm not quite up to snuff. He stops, reaches up and
turns on the radio.
LEO
Le-o like mu-sic.

Shelly picks up a toaster and hurls it at him, bouncing it off his chest. Leo looks at the
toaster, then down at his chest.
LEO
Ow.
Shelly tries to run again, no luck, Leo has her, grabs her by the throat. He starts to spin her
around, his grip tightening on her throat as he does. Shelly tries to pull away, but even with
only one good arm Leo it too much, desperately close to passing out she strikes, gouging at his
eyes. Leo erupts in a rage, throws her into the living room where she crashes against the wall.
Leo then flips the kitchen table over and lets out an animal like howl.
CUT TO:
6. EXT. LEO'S BACK DOOR - NIGHT
Bobby steps up to the door, still buzzed from the evening with Audrey, takes in a deep breath
of the fresh night air, and hears Leo's howl.

7. INT. LEO'S
A bruised and battered Shelly cowers in the corner as Leo slowly approaches, a silent monster.
CUT TO:
8. EXT. LEO'S - NIGHT
Bobby tries the door but it won't open, then bangs on it.
BOBBY
Shelly? Shelly?
Bobby walks over to the window and looks in, rubs on the glass to get a clearer view. Shelly
pulls herself up to the glass, bruised and crying.
BOBBY
(immediate concern)
Shelly?
We hear the howl again, then Leo's fist comes crashing through the window. Bobby tumbles
away from the window in terror.
BOBBY
(stunned)
Leo?
From inside we hear Shelly scream, as Leo grabs her.

Bobby races to the door and tries to break it in, no luck.
CUT TO:
9. INT. LEO'S - NIGHT
Leo has Shelly by the hair and is dragging her toward the living room. Off screen we can hear
the frantic pounding and shouts of Bobby. They reach the kitchen and Leo drops her onto the
floor. Stands over her for a long moment.
LEO
Good-bye wi-fe.
He raises up his big boot above her face, a tear falls from his eye, he's going to crush her.
Shelly screams. Bobby bursts through the back door and is on Leo before he can react. They
tumble to the floor, for a moment Bobby has an advantage.
BOBBY
You bastard!
Leo suddenly reaches up with tremendous strength, grabs a surprised Bobby by the neck and
flips him on to the floor, then is on top of him. Leo smiles.
LEO
Hell-o Bob-by.
Leo begins to laugh, then tightens his grip. Bobby gags, the throat is beginning to go. Bobby
manages to reach into a pocket and pull out his lighter, flicks it on. Leo stares at the flame,
transfixed. Bobby moves the lighter close to Leo's face. Leo smiles, transfixed. Bobby then
adjusts the flame and it shoots up into Leo's face, he erupts in a scream and covers his face with
his hands.
LEO
(screaming)
Ahhhh!
He stands, bounces off the walls knocking things down, then runs out into the darkness. Bobby
crawls over to Shelly, takes her in his arms, a tear falls from her eyes.
SHELLY
Bobby.
BOBBY
It's okay now, he's gone.

Don't leave me again, please, Bobby, please.
BOBBY

creaking on it's hinges.

10. INT. SHERIFF TRUMAN'S OFFICE - MORNING
A flashbulb whites out the scene. When it clears, we are on a white sheet being draped over the
dead man laying on a stretcher. We pull back to Cooper looking tired from a long night of
forensic work which is winding up.
TRUMAN
No prints, no fibers. You were right. If it's Earle, he
didn't miss a beat.
(hands Cooper a cup of coffee)
Did you hear from Denise, uh, Agent Bryson?
COOPER
(nods assent)
The DEA and the Bureau have cleared me of all criminal
charges. But the suspension stands. I'm waiting to hear
from Gordon
TRUMAN
In the meantime you're still my deputy. This case is
your's if you want it.
Cooper looks at the body as it's carried out.
COOPER
I want it, Harry.
Hawk enters.
HAWK
Found that stolen car on a logging road just as you said
... no prints. And just so you know, Hank Jennings
missed the buy at Dead Dog because he was in the
hospital. Claims he was hit by a bus. I cuffed him to
the bed and booked him for parole violation. One more
thing: Shelly Johnson just called. She says Leo Johnson
came to last night, attacked her and ran off into the
woods.
Harry and Cooper react. Another flashbulb goes off.
CUT TO:
11. INT. SHERIFF'S STATION, RECEPTION AREA - MORNING
Close on Andy trying desperately to pull off the surgical gloves he is wearing. He yanks, he
pulls, one last try and it shoots off across the room, sticking to the sliding window of
Lucy's office. Lucy looks up as Andy peels it off the glass.

Lucy, we need to talk... It's about Nicky.
LUCY
Little Nicky?
ANDY
Dick and I have been doing some thinking and some
looking and we think he's a ... he's a ...
LUCY
A what?
The stretcher with the body is slowly wheeled out by TWO ATTENDANTS. One of the
wheels squeaks incredibly loudly. Both Andy and Lucy's eyes are glued to the body as it
slowly passes and exits.
ANDY
(looks around to make sure no one is listening)
We think he murdered his parents.
LUCY
He's nine years old.
ANDY
I know. We think he was six at the time of the crime -
LUCY
(slow boil)
I met little Nicky. I talked to little Nicky. If you two
think, for one second that I'll believe a little defenseless
orphan is a murderer ... the both of you aren't fit to be
fathers to a chimp!
Lucy reaches out, grabs one of the fingers on the glove Andy has on, stretches it out several feet
and lets go... wap!
LUCY
I'm going to get to the bottom of this, right now.
She storms out.

POV: Looking under the hood of the Jaguar.
JAMES moves out from under the hood, finds a smiling Jeffrey and EVELYN.
JEFFREY
I'm Jeffrey Marsh, James. I've been hearing very good
things about your work from Evelyn.
JAMES
See how you feel when you drive it.
JEFFREY
I'm sure it will be fine. Sounds like it's lucky we found
you.
James can't place this pleasant man with the one who beats his wife. He feels like hell.
JAMES
Lucky for me too.
JEFFREY
I hear you're on the road.
JAMES
Yeah. Will be again soon, I guess.
JEFFREY
No itinerary, no deadlines ... I'm envious. Wish I was
going with you.
Evelyn locks her eyes on James who can feel the heat. Jeffrey opens the door to the car.
JEFFREY
Maybe after I take her out for a spin we'll talk shop.
Sounds like we have a mutual love.
(slams the door)
Cars?

Of course he'll stay. There are plenty of things I can
find for him to do... right James?
JAMES
Yeah, maybe.
(her look devours him)
Excuse me.
James leaves, heads for his room.
JEFFREY
Nice kid.
He looks at Evelyn.
EVELYN
He's done a fine job on the car.
Jeffrey slides into the car and ignites the engine. Races the motor.
JEFFREY
Let's see what it will do on the open road.
Evelyn kisses him through the car window.
EVELYN
Bye... Jeffrey.

15. INT. BEN'S OFFICE GREAT NORTHERN - DAY
Close on the flames in the fireplace. We pull back. BEN HORNE, dressed as General Lee,
puffs on a cigar as he sights a small cannon. On the floor of the office are toy soldiers in
marching columns and an elaborate train set. DOCTOR JACOBY sits across the battle field,
pencil and note pad in hand. The office doors swing open, Audrey enters with JERRY.
JERRY
Ben?
JACOBY
He prefers General.
AUDREY
He's marching on Washington. We think he's getting
close.

AUDREY
He thinks you're General Jeb Stuart.
JACOBY
(Soto)
You're with the cavalry.
BEN
Jeb, a great day is upon us. By dawn our troops will be
on the outskirts of Washington. By mid-day it will fall,
and we will once again walk on my cherished fields in
Arlington.
(he looks at Jerry very solemnly)
Only God can stop us now. And it is my firm belief,
Jeb, that the almighty is a Southerner.
Ben moves back to his soldiers. Jerry looks at Audrey, then back at his brother, tries to smile.
JERRY
Hallelujah ...
Jerry glances over to Jacoby, motions him over to join Audrey and himself
JERRY
You think it's a good idea for Ben to be carrying a
sword?
JACOBY
Your brother is suffering from delusions brought about
by emotional collapse. He thinks he's on a forced march
to Washington. He's crossing the Maryland border as we
speak.
AUDREY
He's nuts.
JERRY
(pats her condescendingly on the head)
Why don't you let your uncle Jer decide that for himself.
Ben picks up the flag and waves it.
JERRY
(distraught)
Oh, Ben.

JACOBY
Actually what he is doing is quite healthy. By reversing the South's
defeat in the civil war he will in turn reverse his own setbacks. What he
needs now is both your understanding, a confederate victory, and a good
price for his cotton. Metaphorically speaking.
Jacoby smiles. Jerry looks over at Ben.
BEN
Men of the South, from this day to the ending of the earth we who fight
shall be remembered. For our bravery. For the battle scars we bear.
We few. We happy few. We band of brothers. Onwards... to
Washington.

16. INT. TRUMAN'S OFFICE - DAY
Close on the chess board set found with the body. We slowly circle it, coming to Cooper,
intently staring at it. Coffee cup in hand. Harry joins him.
TRUMAN
How does chess figure into all this?
Cooper studies the board for a moment, then looks at Harry.
COOPER
Because we played a game every day for three years. Windom felt all
of life could be found in the patterns and conflicts created on the board.
And because I never beat him, and we both know it. Now I have to
make my next move. I'll publish it in the Twin Peaks Chronicle
tomorrow. That should do it. He's close.
TRUMAN
Coop, I think I need some more information here.
COOPER
Harry, I've brought some baggage to town with me I haven't told
you about.
TRUMAN
(not demanding)
Well, as your superior -
Cooper turns to Harry. The coffee cup shakes in his hand. Both notice. For the first time
Truman sees fear in Cooper's eyes.
COOPER
Windom Earle was my first partner. Everything I know about the law
and the bureau I owe to him. Four years ago we drew the assignment of
protecting a material witness in a federal crime. She was a very gentle,
very beautiful woman. Her name was Caroline. She and I ... fell in love.

16. CONTINUED:
TRUMAN
What happened?
COOPER
One night, I failed in my vigilance. An attack was
made. I was wounded, stabbed, lost consciousness.
When I awoke, Caroline was in my arms. She was dead.
She had also been stabbed.
TRUMAN
(putting it together)
The wounds on the vagrant?
COOPER
Identical. The killer was never caught. My wounds
healed. Windom Earle ... went mad. Institutionalized,
until his recent escape.
TRUMAN
So why is he after you now?
COOPER
(a beat)
Harry, Caroline was Windom Earle's wife.
Harry takes a seat.
TRUMAN
So he blames you for her death.
COOPER
No. It's worse than that - much worse. I think he killed
her. And I think he also committed the murder that she
originally witnessed. He used to beat her, Harry, that's
what I found out when I ...
(can't continue for a moment)
Windom's mind is ... like a diamond. It's cold and
hard and brilliant and at some point he stopped caring
about right and wrong. I also believe Windom feigned
the insanity that sent him away. You don't know what
he's capable of. You don't know.

JAMES
Don't you knock?
EVELYN
I'm sorry. Are you leaving?

James walks over to the window, then turns and looks at her. The look melts her, and she
realizes it.
EVELVN
Please ... don't leave me. Don't leave me alone with
him.

The BARTENDER goes for the coffee. Donna takes in the scene. Sitting at the other end of
the bar is Evelyn. The bartender returns.
DONNA
I'm looking for a biker. His name is James. James
Hurley. He's expecting me. He's expecting this.
She holds up an envelope. The Bartender looks her over, then glances at Evelyn and nods.
Donna takes out a cigarette. She strikes a match, we follow it up to the cigarette.
EVELYN
You look like someone in need of help.
Donna studies her for a moment.
DONNA
Do I?
EVELYN
How old are you?

He did some work for me recently.
DONNA

EVELYN
He fixed my husband's car.
Donna tries to decide if this woman is a threat.
DONNA

EVELYN
He left, yesterday. On his bike.
DONNA
Where'd he go?

BIG ED
Thanks.
She leaves. Doc notices the look between them.
DOC
Where's Nadine, Ed?
BIG ED
She's got a wrestling match up at Knife River. Doc,
Nadine's what I wanted to talk to you about. You're a

BIG ED
It's downright dangerous. She's liable to kill a young
kid. I don't know what to do.
DOC
Be patient. And tell her to be home by nine o'clock on
school nights.
(Ed smiles, Doc rises)
Ed, Donna took the van this morning, said something
about going to look for James. Is there anything I need
to be worried about?
BIG ED
He's out west a couple of hours, just trying to clear his head,
I think. Donna's taking him some money.
DOC
It's not easy being a parent is it?
BIG ED
It sure ain't.
Doc leaves, Norma walks over with a piece of pie. Slides in across from Ed.
NORMA
Hank's in the hospital. He says a tree fell on him.
(she reaches out and touches a bruise on his face)
Doesn't have anything to do with this, does it?
BIG ED
The tree was a redwood named Nadine.
(Norma doesn't quite get it)
Honey, after you left yesterday, Hank jumped me, right
in my own living room. The truth is, if Nadine hadn't
walked in when she did, it'd be me in the hospital or
someplace worse.
NORMA
Nadine took out Hank?

Yep. And it wasn't pretty.

mistakes I've made.
He reaches out, takes her hand.
BIG ED
We could start by getting a cabin, a bottle of sparkling
wine and some venison steaks.
NORMA
People will find out.
Ed grips her hand.

Lucy leaves. Truman and Cooper turn their attention to Briggs.
TRUMAN
Major, what happened?
BRIGGS
As men who have dedicated their lives to service, I know
you are able to understand how sacred I hold a pledge of
allegiance. And the cost one must pay when breaking a
pledge.
COOPER
It can be very great.
BRIGGS
The Air Force, I thought was not unlike other societies
of men, dedicated to the fight for good.
Harry and Cooper look at each other wondering. Briggs gets up from his chair.
BRIGGS
Gentlemen, frankly I'm worried. When my superiors
questioned me about my disappearance they exhibited a
degree of suspicion and intolerance bordering on the
paranoic. I must now admit that their motivation in the
search for the White Lodge is not ideologically pure.
(turns to them)
I believe that during my disappearance I was taken to
the White Lodge. I remember virtually nothing, but I
have the clear intuitive sense that there is much trouble
ahead.
COOPER
What kind of trouble?
BRIGGS
I am not aware of the form it will take.
(straightens himself up, back to form)
I will return. Until that time, I will be in the shadows if
you need me. Good day, gentlemen.

He leaves, Truman and Cooper follow.

25. INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
Truman and Cooper enter, join Hawk and Andy. At the other end of the room stand Jacoby
and LANA.
JACOBY
Good, I wanted everyone to hear this. I have just spent
most of the last twenty four hours with this charming
young lady. And as you can see, I have no bruises, no
broken bones. Any claims by her deceased husband's
brother that she is cursed and somehow responsible for a
death is nonsense. What she does possess is a heightened
sexual drive and a working knowledge of technique,
anatomy, and touch, few men have ever had the pleasure
of experiencing, or the skill to match.
Lana blushes, smiles. Looks them all over. Pause.
TRUMAN
Is it warm in here?
EVERYONE
Yes.
Cooper steps forward, extends his hand.
COOPER
Lana, let me be the first to congratulate you.
LANA
Thank you. I could never have done it without Dr.
Jacoby.

Jacoby and Lana are staring down the barrel of a huge shotgun, held by DWAYNE

The gun swings back to Lana and Jacoby.
DWAYNE
And the hippie too.
We pull back.
TRUMAN
Mr. Mayor, this is not going to solve anything.
DWAYNE
She killed my brother!
JACOBY
Mr. Mayor, Lana has killed no one.
DWAYNE
Horse dung. Come over here, Lana. Come over here.
No one moves. Cooper steps up.
COOPER
Fellas, why don't we let the Mayor and Lana talk this
over alone.
DWAYNE
I don't want to talk, I want to shoot.
COOPER
You can always shoot later, Dwayne. Talk first.

Right in here. Go ahead, Lana, it'll be fine.

then stops. Several long moments pass. Everyone is getting fidgety.
ANDY

It's kind of hard ... waiting.
Everyone nods. Several more moments pass. Jacoby chuckles again. More silence, then
Cooper steps over to the door of the conference room and listens.
COOPER

He motions Hawk to the other door, they all take out their guns, then burst in.

All guns are trained on Dwayne ... with Lana sitting in his lap in the middle of a deep,
passionate kiss. The guns are all holstered. Dwayne, covered in lipstick, finishes the kiss and
looks up, beaming.
DWAYNE
We've decided to adopt a child.
Lana kisses him again.
LANA
He's so much like Dougie, I feel like my husband's been
brought back to life.
DWAYNE
I've been lonely and selfish. I hope you'll all forgive
my boorish behavior. Come along, dear.

CATHERINE
Have you asked yourself, Pete, how I survived after the
fire? How I was able to effect my transformation into
Tojamura and marshall the resources I needed to defeat
Ben and win back the mill?
PETE
Now that you mention it ... yeah.
Catherine opens the doors, revealing ANDREW PACKARD. Pete is speechless.
ANDREW

If it isn't sneaky Pete Martell.
PETE

Andrew ... I saw the boat ... you ... you ...
ANDREW
(off his stuttering stupification)
Take all the time you need. Good old Pete.
CATHERINE
As you can surmise, I had Andrew's help.
PETE
So, let me get this straight, you didn't die in the boat
accident.
ANDREW
We didn't tell you, Pete, with apologies beforehand,
because you didn't need to know. And frankly ... we
didn't want you to.
PETE
Okay. Well, if you're bringing anybody else back from
the dead, I vote for Veronica Lake.

No.
ANDREW
Eckhardt and I were business partners. I knew lumber, he
knew Hong Kong. We made a lot of money, had some
fun ... then I got the better of him in a piece of business
and he tried to stab me in the back ...
PETE
Really?
ANDREW
In a manner of speaking. He's a very dangerous and
powerful opponent.
CATHERINE
He plotted Andrew's death for six years. After he
thought Andrew was dead he came after me.
PETE
Does Josie know you're alive, Andy?
Catherine and Andrew glance at each other. As if talking to a child.
CATHERINE
Pete, dear, Josie worked for Eckhardt.
PETE
That's right. She did? My God ... is she still?
CATHERINE
We'll find out when Eckhardt arrives.
PETE
He's coming here?
Andrew nods.

The fax machine begins to beep. Truman steps behind the desk to retrieve the incoming
message. We see concern on his face. Andy and Cooper sit behind him.
Lucy walks in with Doc Hayward and DICK TREMAYNE. Everyone stops, sizes up the
situation. A stern Doc zeros in on Andy.
HAYWARD
Andy, in here, we're going to talk.
Andy dutifully follows Doc into Truman's office. Truman studies the fax. Troubled.
TRUMAN
Coop, we've got another problem. I need to ask you a
favor.
That brings him back.
COOPER
Harry, there's something we have to get straight. You're
in charge, I work for you now. You say jump, I'll jump.
Cooper smiles, so does Harry.
TRUMAN
This just came over the wire from Seattle.
He shows him a clipping from a Seattle newspaper. MURDERED MAN FOUND IN
ALLEY NEAR AIRPORT. And a picture of Jonathan, the Asian man. Murdered.

Close on Andy and Dick seated next to each other. Doc stands above them, his arms folded
across his chest. Lucy vigorously paces the room.
HAYWARD
When Lucy told me about your "theory" I called the
orphanage and cut through the red tape. I immediately
got to the bottom of things because I was there when it
all begin. Little Nicky is no more a murderer than
Lucy or I.
TREMAYNE
I believe pathological was the phrase we used, Doc -
HAYWARD
Dick, I didn't drop you on your head when I brought you
into this world, don't give me cause to regret that.
ANDY
Doc, it's just -
HAYWARD
Shut up and listen, the both of you.
Lucy smacks a bug with a flyswatter like it's a baseball.
HAYWARD
Little Nicky entered this world through the back door
where hope and promise never saw the light. His mother
was a poor immigrant chambermaid at the Great
Northern. Nicky was conceived during an assault by a
man in a back alley who fled across the border. She
never reported it to the police, but when she started to
show she reported it to me. But Nicky's mother had a
dream for a better life, for herself and her child. It was
the dream that brought her to this country. She decided
to carry that child. The poor wretch never saw the boy.
She died just as Nicky took his first breath. I delivered
that woman's baby. We buried her in Potter's Field and
sent the infant to the orphanage. For several years he was
shuttled from one state home to another. Then one day,
hope finally shined on little Nicky. A young childless
couple brought him into their lives. They were loving,
caring parents. It all collapsed in one terrible moment
on an icy highway. There was a crash. Six year old
Nicky managed to pull both his parents from the
burning wreck, but it was too late, and Nicky was alone
once again, as he is today.

Jones turns and looks across the lobby. Standing by the fireplace is Thomas Ekhardt,

moment, sensing something different about these two people.
