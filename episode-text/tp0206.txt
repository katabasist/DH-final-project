ACT ONE
FADE IN:
1. INT. HAROLD SMITH'S HOUSE - NIGHT
SUDDENLY: HAROLD SMITH looms, gardening tool in hand. It arcs through the air,
smashes Laura's diary out of MADDY FERGUSON'S hands. Maddy screams, backs toward
the door. But DONNA HAYWARD remains frozen in place, ashen, as Smith turns to her.
He speaks quietly at first, almost puzzled. And quite mad.
SMITH
I trusted you. I invested my heart and my soul in you.
DONNA
We only wanted to read it, I didn't -
MADDY
Donna, run!
SMITH
(mounting fury)
I thought you were different. You made me feel I could
return to the world and find something decent and pure.
But you're just like all the others. You lie, you betray, and
then you laugh about it. You are unclean. You have
contaminated me.
Smith raises the tool over his head. Donna remains transfixed. Maddy screams.
MADDY
DONNA!!
Just then: the front door explodes open, JAMES HURLEY tumbles inside. The sound
distracts Smith, Donna regains her senses, turns to run. But then she spots Laura's diary open
on the floor nearby. Donna moves toward it, as if to grab and flee. Smith yells:
SMITH
(he rushes toward the diary)
NO!
JAMES
Donna!
James rushes forward, Smith raises his hand to strike. Donna retreats, James pushes Smith
out of the way, takes Donna by the hand. Maddy joins them as they rush our the door. Smith
kneels to retrieve the diary. He looks at the open door, the black night beyond it. The world
outside. Smith turns and races back to his greenhouse.
CAMERA VIEWS Smith through the large glass panel, his features lurch into view, shadowy,
distorted by the glass. He lets out a howl, but we can't quite hear it behind the thick panes.

2. EXT. HAROLD SMITH'S HOUSE - NIGHT
James, Donna, and Maddy race into the night.
JAMES
Run!!
DONNA
(looking back at house)
He's not coming. He won't. He's afraid.
They stop running, catch breath.
JAMES
Are you okay? Did he hurt you?
DONNA
No. I'm fine. I ...
Donna begins to cry. James takes her into his arms. Donna holds him tighter.
DONNA
Oh James. It's all my fault. I'm so sorry.
JAMES
Don't cry. It's my fault too.
(to Maddy, as if to include)
We have to tell the Sheriff. We'll tell him everything.
DONNA
You've had enough trouble. I'll go.
JAMES
But -
DONNA
Just hold me. Please.
James takes Donna into a deeper embrace. Maddy stands and watches. Then looks away.

4. INT. THE BOOKHOUSE - NIGHT
AGENT COOPER carries AUDREY HORNE into the Bookhouse interior. She moans
softly, drifting in and out. DEPUTY HAWK enters behind him. They are met by, a
handsome young man. A Bookhouse Boy named CAPPY.
CAPPY
We're all set up inside.
Cooper nods, no time for conversation. He carries Audrey to a bed inside a curtained area.
Cappy pulls back a blue blanket, assists Cooper as he gently sets Audrey upon it. They work
with quiet, but discernible urgency.
Cooper checks Audrey's pulse, softly placing two fingers upon her neck. He peers into her
eyes, listens to whispered breath.
COOPER
Sluggish pulse. Pupils constricted. Breathing slow and shallow.
Cooper gently lifts her left arm - every time he touches her it is with great care and precision
and checks inside the elbow. Bruises. Red pinpricks.
COOPER
Needle tracks. Most likely heroin.
HAWK
Poor kid.
AUDREY
(faintly)
Daddy? ... Can you see me Daddy?
COOPER
Multiple injections over the course of a two day period.
Audrey, can you hear me?
Audrey says nothing. Her eyes roll back. She nearly loses consciousness. Cooper leans closer.
COOPER
Audrey, you must stay awake. Do you hear me? You've
got to stay awake.
AUDREY
(airy whisper)
Can you catch me? ... Can you ...?
Cooper watches, helpless, uncertain. Then, urgent, emphatic:
COOPER
I want you to talk to me. Audrey, Please.

There's a faint note of desperation in his voice. But Audrey cannot hear it. She's lost in a
heroin fog, she rambles, slips in and out.
AUDREY
His tongue, so heavy ... a hand in my throat ... it hurts me,
Oh God it hurts ...
(she shivers uncontrollably)
Black cold, the lake, black cold ... can't breathe ... help
me, please help me ... I'm sinking ...
Cooper gently gathers Audrey into his arms.
COOPER
I'm here, Audrey. I will stay with you. You're right here.
You're right here with me.
Cooper gently places a hand upon her cheek, offers a healing caress. Suddenly: Audrey's
hand rises into view, takes Cooper by the palm. Holds on tight.
COOPER
Audrey?
Audrey's eyes focus. She sees him for the first time.
AUDREY
(weak as a kitten)
I prayed prayed that you would come and you did ...
He holds her.

5. EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT
Maddy drives off in the station wagon. James and Donna stand together, face to face.
DONNA
She was so brave. I feel terrible. If anything had
happened to her
(can't continue)
JAMES
No more plans, okay? No more going off on our own.
DONNA
James, he has Laura's secret diary. He could have killed
her.
JAMES
He could've killed you too.

Donna offers a gentle kiss, looks deep into James' eyes. A beat, then:
DONNA
I feel stupid. Ashamed.
JAMES
After Laura died, everything happened so fast. It's hard
to know exactly what to believe in.
DONNA
(he's read her mind)
Yes.
JAMES
Bur when I saw you tonight I knew exactly what I
believed.
DONNA
Did you?
JAMES
It's like if we could put our hearts together, and keep
them that way forever, we'd be safe no matter what.
DONNA
You and me.
JAMES
From now on.
DONNA
Yes.
James kisses her on the mouth. Donna reacts with whispered repetition.
DONNA
Yes.
They kiss with even greater fervor. Their passion in direct contrast to - or perhaps in
conjunction with - their innocence.

7. INT. TRUMAN'S OFFICE - NIGHT
Sheriff Truman looks up from a book of mug shots and corresponding paper work as
Cooper enters and slumps, exhausted, into a chair across from him.
TRUMAN
How is she?
COOPER
She's through the worst of it. Heroin.
(Truman reacts)
This close to a lethal dose. Sooner or later the dope
would have been lethal. Hard to imagine that kind of
cruelty.
Truman slides the mug book over to Cooper. Points out a shot.
TRUMAN
Not really. Take a look. Blackie's killer. I knew I'd
seen him before. Jean Renault.
COOPER
"Renault?"
TRUMAN
Eldest to Jacques and Bernard. Hell of a lot more
dangerous.
(hand's Cooper a sheet on Renault)
He runs the northern territories. Drugs, extortion,
gambling; you name it.

TRUMAN (continued)
(putting the pieces together)
There was a tape in Blackie's office of you playing
blackjack the night you and Big Ed visited the casino.
COOPER
(his surmise)
Jean Renault was after me.
TRUMAN
(completing the thought)
The man who caught his brother.
COOPER
(grim)
Renault planned to kill me. And he used Audrey as bait.
It's a deeply troubling revelation. A long beat. Truman comforts, reminds:
TRUMAN
We got her back, Coop. And she's going to be okay.
Cooper doesn't look convinced, a long beat. Then
COOPER
I went out of my jurisdiction twice I've violated my
professional code. And Audrey is paying the price for it.
TRUMAN
We did what we had to do.
COOPER
(beat)
This isn't the first time my actions have brought suffering
to someone I care about. In the name of 'doing what I
thought I had to do.' Dammit. I should have known better.
TRUMAN
That doesn't change the fact that Audrey's here now. Not
up at Jack's with a needle in her arm.
(beat)
You're the best lawman I've ever seen, Cooper. But
sometimes you think too much.
He says the latter with admiration and quiet humor. Cooper appreciates both.
COOPER
Thank you, Harry.

The middle of the night. Deserted, errie. Cooper walks through the empty room carrying a
briefcase full of cash.
BEN HORNE enters, finds Cooper waiting for him there. Ben is nervous, but trying hard to
hide it. How much does Cooper know?
BEN
Agent Cooper, I got your call.
(spotting briefcase)
What happened? Did you ... ?
COOPER
We were able to free your daughter without payment.
Cooper hands him the briefcase.
BEN
(referring to cash as well as daughter)
Thank God.
COOPER
Audrey was being held in a brothel north of the border
known as One-Eyed Jack's.
BEN
(feigning shock)
No.
COOPER
The brothel's Madam was at least partially responsible
for your daughter's kidnapping and subsequent blackmail.
Ben pauses, fearing what Cooper might know. All the things Blackie could have told him.
BEN
Did you arrest her?

COOPER
She was killed before we could question her.
BEN
(trying to hide his pleasure)
No!
COOPER
Murdered by a man named Jean Renault.
BEN
(as if hearing the name for the first time)
And this Renault, did you catch him?
COOPER
He escaped.
BEN
(more good news)
Too bad.
(opens briefcase, peers at the inside)
Everything seems to be in order.
COOPER
(quietly critical)
Audrey's recovering from a drug overdose.
BEN
(paternal in spite of himself)
Drug overdose? Oh my God.
COOPER
She's going to be all right.
BEN
Can I see her?
COOPER
I wouldn't disturb her now. She's resting, comfortably.
I'll call you in the morning.
Ben doesn't like his tone. But given the time and place, not to mention all the lies he's telling.
BEN
Yes, do that, Agent Cooper. Thank you.
Ben reaches out, takes Cooper into a celebratory hug. It's an odd, awkward gesture.
Unexpected. Completely devoid of feeling.

BEN (CONTINUED)
Thank you for bringing my Audrey back to me.
Cooper accepts the embrace. Grudgingly. Then extricates himself, prepatory to leaving
COOPER
Good night, Mr. Horne.
Ben watches, wheels turning, as Cooper steps into the shadows.

FADE IN:
10. INT. LEO JOHNSON'S HOME DAY
BOBBY BRIGGS, in sport coat and tie, struggles to push LEO JOHNSON in his wheelchair
through the doorway. It's too tight a fit. Bobby curses under his breath, struggles with the
chair. Maybe he can slide it through sideways.
SHELLY JOHNSON and an Insurance Representative, TOM BROCKMAN, watch Leo's
bumpy progress from the living room. Shelly winces with each shove and bang. Brockman,
fifties, unctuous, offers his best sympathy:
BROCKMAN
Poor fellow, really gone.
BOBBY
(muttered)
You ain't kiddin'.
Bobby finally gets Leo into the living room nearly losing control of the chair, but holds on
tight, manages a grim smile for Brockman. The Insurance Agent returns it.
BROCKMAN
I want you to know how much I admire you kids,
standing by Mr. Johnson. Not taking the easy way out.
Most people would just ship him off.
BOBBY
(as close to piety as he can manage)
Yeah, well, Leo's sorta special to us.
BROCKMAN
Believe you me, in-home care is the stuff of miracles. It
may not always seem that way to you, but Mr. Johnson
should benefit tremendously from his being here among
his loved ones.
SHELLY
(working, a smile into place)
We certainly hope so.
BROCKMAN
(while inspecting bed and winch)
Will you be hiring full or part-time help?
SHELLY
Cousin Bobby and I will be here full-time.

BROCKMAN
I admire your dedication.
(concluding, reaching into briefcase)
Everything looks to be in order. You might want to child-
proof those electrical sockets when you get a chance. Sign
here ...
Brockman extracts a form from his briefcase. Shelly signs it.
BROCKMAN
(returns form to briefcase, hands Shelly envelope)
Your check
Shelly opens it, reacts with disbelief.
SHELLY
There must be some mistake.
Bobby takes the check Looks at it. He can't believe it either.
BOBBY
1700 bucks?
BROCKMAN
(with a sympathetic nod)
Sad, isn't it? The cost of health care is going through the
roof.
BOBBY
It's bringing rain. We're supposed to get five thousand a
month.
BROCKMAN
Figure state and local taxes, equipment fees, medical and
maintinence costs, administrative fees ... you see the
results. Fortunately with you two here Mr. Johnson will
be more than adequately provided for. Good luck
Brockman extends a hand for shaking. Bobby just looks at him for beat, a little dazed. Then
he offers an aimless handclasp. Brockman exits. Shelly turns to Bobby, mortified.
SHELLY
I have to quit my job, Bobby. How am I going to make
it on this?
BOBBY
I don't know.

in the first place -
BOBBY

Shelly stops, swallows hard. Fights a few unwanted tears.
SHELLY
Well you'd better think of somethin'. For both of us.
Just then: a quiet noise from Leo's chair. From Leo. It starts somewhere deep his chest,
then pours weakly out his lips. A moan. A protest. Bobby and Shelly both whirl about, stare
at Leo with amazement. His face remains blank. His eyes deeply empty. But the sound
continues, now stutters just a bit. HOLD ON Leo for a beat.

Donna sits before a doubting Sheriff Truman in the Interrogation Room.
TRUMAN
Donna. We, already have Laura Palmer's diary.
DONNA
No, this is her secret diary.
TRUMAN
(dubious)
And she gave it to this "Harold Smith?" Why?
DONNA
I don't know. To hide it or something.
TRUMAN
Did he ever actually show you the diary?
DONNA
No. But he read from it. I saw her name on the inside
cover. Her handwriting.

All right. I'll try to get someone out there to take a look.
We've got our hands full, I can't promise anything -

nothing, just looks at Audrey. Then he kneels to wake her.
COOPER

Audrey's eyes flutter open. She's weak, dreamy. Ben comes around from behind Cooper,
crouches at her side.
BEN
Thank god, Audrey. Thank god.
Ben tries to embrace her. But Audrey focuses, realizes who it is. And recoils. Cooper takes
notice. Ben shifts backward, plays the loving father without missing a beat.

BEN

Don't talk now, sweetheart. We're going to get you

terrible experience. What terrible people. The things
you must have seen.

You've kept yourself in fine nick, Josie. Sapphire earrings

Suddenly: Jonathan grabs Josie behind the neck, pulls her forward. Josie shudders, is afraid to
resist. Jonathan offers a cold, hurtful kiss. Then he whispers.
JONATHAN
Be adaptable.
JOSIE
(pleading through her fear)
We had an arrangement ...
Jonathan releases her, now turns his grip into a caress, his fingers tracing her jawbone.
JONATHAN
Sheriff Truman is important to you. You be to him. You
make him into a fool. But he is important to you
nonetheless,
(her silence gives him the answer he needs)
Leave with me tonight. Or I'll kill him.
JOSIE
He doesn't know anything -
Jonathan's fingers move smoothly from jawbone to lips, silence her. It is a gesture both
violent and sexual.
JONATHAN
The plane leaves at midnight. Be there. Or I will come
for you. And your Sheriff. That's ... the arrangement.

Not really.
JAMES
When we were to together you know, just talking ... I felt
something. I just wasn't sure.
MADDY

You looked at me and you saw Laura.
JAMES
I guess I did.
MADDY
Want to know somethin' strange? I liked it.
JAMES
You did?
MADDY
When we were growing up, Laura and I were so close it
was scary. I could feel her thoughts. Like our brains were
connected or something. Our mothers were the same way.
(beat)
When she died suddenly I had a chance to be Laura. At
least other people saw me that way. Like the way you
looked at me. I liked that too.
JAMES
It was wrong.
MADDY
It wasn't one thing or the other. For a while I got to be
somebody different. Now I'm just me again.

JAMES
If you really love someone, it's like this bright light is
shining on you every minute. You're right in it. It's great.
But I don't think you can stay that way all the time.
MADDY
Sure you can.
JAMES
(looks at her, beat)
I want to. I want to try to make the way my heart feels
last forever. Pretty weird.
Maddy doesn't think it's weird at all. A tender beat. Just a whisper of what might have been
between them. Then Maddy offers a confession of her own:
MADDY
I'm going home tomorrow, James. I came to Twin Peaks
for Laura's funeral. And I stayed for Uncle Leland and
Aunt Sarah, just to help out. But it's time to go ...
JAMES
So this is goodbye or somethin' ...

Now, to what do I owe the pleasure of this call?
JOSIE
I've got the contract with Pete's Signature. I want my
money.
BEN
Of course you do.
JOSIE
All of it. Now. Before you get this.
BEN
Josie, Josie. Surely a mind as quicksilver as your own can
grasp the complicated position we're in. Fluidity is all.
I can't summon up cash reserves I don't have. But I have
already and will be happy to assure you again that as the
contracted payments arrive from Iceland your percentage
will immediately -
JOSIE
(hot)
I won't leave this office without my money
Pause.
BEN
Why do I sense this isn't a negotiable position? You're
under some kind of pressure, aren't you?
JOSIE

Do not ... play games with me.
BEN
Games?
Ben smiles, reaches into a drawer, removes a small gold key. He holds it up for Josie to see.

This key unlocks my personal hotel safe. And inside that
safe, I've put together a fascinating dossier on you, dear
Josie, and husband Andrew's little boat that went boom.
(beat, cold)
So you behave yourself, lady, or, believe me when I say
this ... I will ... bury you.
Josie moves towards him. Shows him a key.
JOSIE
That's a shame. Because if anything unfortunate were to
happen to me, it would lead authorities to a certain safety
deposit box in another city. Inside of which is
enough evident to put you away for three lifetimes.
They'll bury us side by side.
They stare at each other; mongoose and cobra.
BEN
Stalemate.
Now Josie moves towards Ben seductively, holding the contract.
JOSIE
Your move. Cash.
BEN
(pause; an idea)
Happily, I can accomodate you.
He goes back to his desk, retrieves TOJAMURA'S CASHIER'S CHECK and endorses it.
BEN
A sign of my good faith. Tokyo bank. Five million
dollars.
Ben hands the check to Josie. She examines it. Folds it. Puts it away. Hands him the
contract.

Well played, Josie.

CUT TO:
18. INT. LEO JOHNSON'S HOUSE - NIGHT
START CLOSE on Leo Johnson. Wheelchair bound, he wears a festive party hat, Ray Ban
shades, and a blank expression. A kazoo hangs from his mouth, it bleats with each jagged
breath. But Leo remains perfectly still. On permanent leave in the Land of Nod.
ANOTHER ANGLE reveals Bobby and Shelly. Wearing party hats, piping a jaunty tune on
their own kazoos, Auld Lang Syne. Shelly leads Leo to the dinner table, a cake before him.
Bobby acts the mocking Master of Ceremonies.
BOBBY
Leo, we figured with you gettin' out and all, well, what
the hell, we sorta wanted to give you a little party. Our
way of saying, hey, Leo Johnson, welcome home.
SHELLY
(mock dutiful)
Welcome home, darling.
Bobby paces, steps behind Leo. Adjusts his glasses. Tweaks his nose.
BOBBY
Cause you're a special guy, Leo. And we just want you to
know that we remember all the great stuff you did for the
ones you loved.
Bobby pulls up Leo's hat, the elastic chin strap stretches, then Bobby lets it snap back down.
BOBBY
Like Shelly here. Who could ask for a more caring and
thoughtful husband? Makin' her clean your dirty clothes.
Wash your dishes. Mop your floors. You're a class act,
man. Top to bottom.
(kneels, speaks right past his ear)
And how 'bout Leo Johnson, wife abuser? There's a guy
you want to party with. Soap in a sock. Internal injuries
and barely leaves a bruise.
(rises, resumes pacing)
But last, and I'm thinkin' not least, we got Leo Johnson,
murderer. Hang your wife up like a piece of meat.
Leave her to burn. Don't let anybody ever tell ya you
don't know how to treat a woman.
Bobby puts his arms around Shelly. Gives her a deep kiss. Both turn to look at Leo in his
chair, festively decorated, utterly silent.

BOBBY

"This is your life," Leo Johnson. You deserve it. Every
damn minute.
Bobby kisses her again, gently pushes her backward, onto the table. Takes one last look at
Leo.
BOBBY
Sorta makes you believe in karma, don't it?
Bobby kisses her more passionately, she returns his kisses with equal fervor. He pulls at her
blouse, she hurries to unbutton his shirt. But then, she can't help it, Shelly turns to glance at
Leo.
Leo remains inert. But the angle, Shelly's guilty conscience, perhaps a flare of light off the Ray
Bans, all conspire to suggest movement, some imperceptible shift in Leo's posture.
Shelly SCREAMS. Rolls out from under Bobby.
BOBBY
What? What?
SHELLY
He moved. I saw him move.
(he reaches or he she pulls away)
No. It's too creepy. It's wrong, Bobby.
Bobby looks from Shelly to Leo. Walks to him.
BOBBY
Okay, Shel. Maybe you're right. I mean I don't wanna
exploit him or nothing.
Bobby carefully removes the party hat, the shades. And the kazoo from Leo's mouth.
BOBBY
Sorry, Leo. We sorta lost control. No need to make
your rehabilitation any more difficult than it already is.
Doc Hayward says you need 'familiar stimulus', so we
just figured, what the hell ... kazoos.
Bobby scoots Leo a little closer to the dinner table, the cake before him, continues, soothes:
BOBBY
Honest, Leo, Shelly and me are gonna do everything we
can to keep you safe and happy.
(new idea)
You want some cake or somethin'? That'd be nice, huh?
With ice cream?

Bobby spoons a big scoop onto the cake as he speaks. Leo does a header into the cake and
cream. Shelly gasps.
SHELLY
Bobby!
Bobby pulls Leo's face out of the cake, returns him to a sitting position. Turns to Shelly.
BOBBY
Gee, you gotta be more careful, Leo. Good thing we
didn't light the candles.
A beat. Then, she can't help it... Shelly begins to laugh.

I can't be too specific, Leland, but with Jerry on the road
I need you back here. Let's just say I have a much better
sense of what you've been through in the last few weeks.
LELAND
I appreciate that, Ben. And I appreciate the confidence.
Really I do.
BEN
If it weren't for your indictment, I could drop you into
your old slot. Our friendship, our history together. But
first I need to know you're okay.
LELAND
I am 100%. 110%. Let me prove it to you.
BEN
(jumping right in)
We've taken a payment from the Icelanders on
Ghostwood, but a group from the Orient wants in in the
worst way. Jerry's on his way to Tokyo to check them
out. I'm about to take Mr. Big to dinner. We need to
buy a little time here.
LELAND
First thing we do is re-survey the land. Required because
of the fire. Set up a parade of inspectors, federal, state,
and county 'til Jerry comes back with a full report. If
there is money coming from either direction, we run it
thru the Caymans, pick up some pocket money on the
exchange rate. And if we have to we can drop escrow
into a black hole for six months.
BEN
(beaming)
That's my Leland.
The phone RINGS, Ben answers it. Tojomura is waiting for him in the hotel bar. While Ben
is occupied, Leland slips over to the bookshelf, a stuffed white fox displayed there. Leland
surreptitiously removes a clump of hair from the stuffed animal, secrets it in his coat pocket.
