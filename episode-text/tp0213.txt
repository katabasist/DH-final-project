ACT ONE
FADE IN:
1A. EXT. WOODS - DAY
MAJOR BRIGGS sits in an armchair in the middle of a fog forest clearing. It's an odd
image. As if it occurred inside his mind. Briggs' moods shifts with great alacrity, alternating
between inchoate rambling and coherence, as if someone had popped his mental cork.
BRIGGS
I ... I remember stepping from the flames, a vague shape
in the dark ... then nothing. Until I found myself standing
by the cold remains of our campfire. Two days later.
VOICES enter the Major's dreamscape. Dr. Hayward and Agent Cooper.
HAYWARD'S VOICE
Major, there are some new therapeutic techniques that
might help us to break through your amnesia.
BRIGGS
My memories are immune to regression. I can feel
them, they are palpable. The smell and sensations...
everything is known to me. Yet somehow beyond my
reach.
COOPER'S VOICE
Do you remember anything else?
BRIGGS
Very little. Save for one disturbing image. A giant
owl. Pervasive.
COOPER'S VOICE
A giant owl. How big?
SUDDENLY: a flash of blinding LIGHT, the image of a screeching OWL flying fast
and low, and a second FLASH leading us to...
CUT TO:
1. INT. SHERIFF'S CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
Briggs seated in the same armchair inside the conference room. AGENT COOPER and
SHERIFF TRUMAN gather around him. DR. HAYWARD completes a physical exam, has
just snapped a poloroid of the Major's head - hence the second FLASH of light.
BRIGGS
(answering Cooper's query)
Enough to cloud my mind and memory.

1. CONTINUED:
HAYWARD
(receiving undeveloped print, reporting his
findings)
Three triangular scars behind his right ear. In perfect
proportion.
TRUMAN
(still the skeptic)
Major Briggs, exactly what kind of work do you do?
BRIGGS
That information is, as I have repeated endlessly to
myself ... classified. Though the keeping of secrets
seems less meaningful to me now.
(his mind wanders)
Perhaps there are sources of information that transcend
the human need to conspire. Information of such weight
that it pertains not to the ...
(struggling, emotional)
My God, is this meant for the soul, my soul ...?
COOPER
(gentle prompting)
Maybe you should start at the beginning.
BRIGGS
(after a beat)
Are you familiar with Project Blue Book?
COOPER
The Air Force project dedicated to the investigation of
Unidentified Flying Objects.
BRIGGS
(pulling himself together)
Officially disbanded in 1969. But there are those of us
who continue in an unofficial capacity. Examining the
heavens as before. And, in the case of Twin Peaks, the
earth below.
(beat)
We are searching for a place called the White Lodge -
Cooper reacts, remembers Hawk's stories. But before he can answer... a knock at the door,
followed by the entrance of two stern UNIFORMED MP'S.
MP #1
Major Briggs?

BRIGGS
(almost relieved)
I've been expecting you.
Briggs rises to join them. The MP's mean to escort him to the door. Truman protests.
TRUMAN
Now wait just one minute...
MP #1
Colonel Reilly's orders.
BRIGGS (mediating)
I'm afraid we will have to continue this discussion at a
later date. Goodbye.
With that, the MP's lead Briggs from the room. Hayward looks at the poloroid, now
developed. He hands it to Agent Cooper. Three scars behind the Majors right ear in perfect
proportion. Just then: a drop of WATER falls from above, splatters upon the image From a
fire sprinkler overhead. Just like the one that heralded Bob's flight to freedom.
2. HARRY'S OFFICE - DAY
ERNIE NILES stares at the telephone on Truman's desk as if, it was his worst enemy.
DENISE BRYSON stands nearby, gestures toward it.
DENISE
Go ahead, Ernie. It won't bite.
ERNIE
(rising, and lying, to the occasion)
A lot you know. We're dealing with a murderous thug
here. Not that I haven't had plenty of dealings with his
kind before. Jean Renault is a hard man, but I've known
men who'd make him quiver -
DENISE
Ernie.
ERNIE
All right, all right, all right.
Ernie picks up the receiver. Just then: Cooper and Truman step into the room. Startled, Ernie
returns the receiver to its cradle with a resounding SLAM.
TRUMAN
(re unexpected entrance)
Sorry.

COOPER
Setting the buy?
DENISE
Trying to. Ernie's a little gunshy.
ERNIE (insulted)
Gunshy? Ernie Niles is bold as bold can be. Let me at
him.
(he reaches for the phone, then a sudden gear shift)
Please don't make me do this. This is suicide. I know.
I'm begging you, please. I don't want to. I'm begging.
Denise deadpans, gestures toward the telephone. A long beat. Ernie sighs, dials. Someone
answers. He pales a bit, pauses, then, meekly:
ERNIE
May I please speak to Jean Renault?

3. A STATION CORRIDOR - DAY
Deputy ANDY BRENNEN enters a corridor, finds Tremayne waiting for him.
TREMAYNE
Andrew, where have you been?
ANDY
Cat in tree.
TREMAYNE
A peace officer's work is never done. Lucky for us my
efforts bore more palatable fruit.
(proudly imparts a great secret)
I paid the Happy Helping Hand adoption agency a visit
where several blue-haired ladies were only too happy to
sup from my open palm. Unfortunately, all of Little
Nicky's records had been sealed and returned to the
Orphanage.
ANDY
We'll never know what really happened to Little Nicky's
parents.
TREMAYNE
Courage, Andrew. Do not despair. Next stop: that
selfsame Orphanage. And Little Nicky's records
within.

ANDY
(getting cold feet)
Maybe we should tell Lucy.
TREMAYNE
Absolutely not. Our investigation into Nicky's past
must proceed sub rosa. This, dear boy, is strictly a
man's job.
(putting on his best Holmesian visage)
Follow me.
Andy and Tremayne exit. Lucy peeks out of her cubicle, curious. All she SEES is Agent
Cooper as he approaches. Cooper wonders:
COOPER
Any luck, Lucy?
LUCY
I checked the personals columns in every national
newspaper on the list and I didn't find anything that
looked like a chess thing or any mention of the name
Windom Earle. Sorry.
Cooper gives Lucy an encouraging pat, and turns toward the door.

ED HURLEY finishes breakfast at the counter. NORMA JENNINGS hands him his check.
The latter occurs under the watchful eye of HANK JENNINGS, standing to the rear.
NORMA
(she knows Hank is watching)
Everything all right, Ed?
ED
(so does he)
Just fine, thanks. For you.
Ed rises, hands her a bill. And a NOTE beneath it. Norma reacts, tucks the note into her apron.

NORMA

'Bye now
They exchange a meaningful glance. Ed exits. And behind them, his eyes dark with anger and
suspicion, Hank watches every single move.
6. MIKE AT THE COUNTER
MIKE NELSON enjoys a morning cup of coffee. His respite is shattered by the sudden
appearance of NADINE HURLEY at the stool beside him.
NADINE
Good morning, Mike Nelson!
MIKE
(muttered)
Oh, Lord.
NADINE
Wanna share a soda? How about a nice big piece of
cherry pie. Two forks.
MIKE
Mrs. Hurley, Nadine, I want my own piece of cherry pie.
In fact, I want two pieces of cherry pie for myself
NADINE
Okay. Meat loaf!
MIKE
(anger rising)
Cherry pie and coffee. In fact, sixteen cups of coffee.
(at Nadine)
I don't want to talk with you. I don't want to walk with
you. I don't want to see you. I don't want to know you.
Is that clear enough to understand? Or will I need a
court order to get my point across?
A long beat. Nadine's worldview severely challenged. She bows her head for a beat,
chastised. Then looks up, the light of love not yet extinguished in her eyes.
NADINE
Mike Nelson you are the handsomest boy I've ever
known. And I would really like it if you and I could go
out on a date.
A beat of stunned silence. Suddenly - Nadine gives Mike a kiss. Deep, much deeper than he
has ever been kissed before. And more sexual than the kisses of a hundred high school girls.

NADINE
Sorry. Sometimes I can't help myself.
Mike pauses, stunned. By both the kiss ... and how much he liked it.

7. HANK JENNINGS
HANK enters from the kitchen, carrying an order. He pauses to watch NORMA
JENNINGS grab car keys and purse from a shelf beneath the register.
HANK
Where're you headed?
NORMA
I've got a couple errands.
HANK
(friendly)
Little early for errands, isn't it? We've still got most of
the breakfast crowd.
NORMA
(ditto)
Think of this as a test, Hank. Just you, an a kitchen full
of scrambled eggs. I'll be right back.
Norma exits. Hank watches her go. She lied to him and he knows it.

SHELLY JOHNSON directs a spoonful of cereal into LEO JOHNSON's mouth. But Leo
sputters, gurgles, and half the cereal spews out upon the table. And Shelly.
SHELLY
(exasperated)
Dammit. It's your turn to feed him.
BOBBY BRIGGS, seated opposite, looks up from his paper. Like a beleaguered husband no
longer satisfied with happy memories.

BOBBY

I got practice.
SHELLY
Football season is over.
BOBBY
This is baseball, baby. Our national pastime.
SHELLY
Okay. Then you can wash him when you get back.
BOBBY
(throwing down paper, getting to his feet)
I'm not coming back.
SHELLY
What did you say?
BOBBY
You're lookin' at Ben Horne's brand new boy. Do the
words "golden opportunity" mean anything to you? This
is my big break. And I've got better things to do than
give Leo Johnson a bubble bath.
SHELLY
And what about me? Don't I have anything better to do?
BOBBY
Not that I can think of.
He didn't mean it. Shelly SLAPS him hard across the face. Bobby stares at her for a beat.
Then turns and walks out the door. Shelly yells after:
SHELLY
Bobby!!!!

10. INT./EXT. MARSH GARAGE - DAY
JAMES HURLEY at the garage phone. He dials, waits.
JAMES
(after a beat)
Uncle Ed? Yeah, it's me ... I'm okay. Listen. I need a
favor. Get the money out of my savings account,
whatever's left. And send it care of me to The Broken
Bones, it's a bar out on 96...

James senses someone close by, looks up. It's EVELYN MARSH, standing quite still in the
garage doorway. She wears dark sunglasses. James stares at her for a beat, returns to Big Ed on
the phone.
JAMES (continued)
... I can't explain. I'll call you later. Got to go.
James lowers the receiver from his lips. Evelyn steps closer, she smiles.
EVELYN
Long distance?
JAMES
Twin Peaks.
EVELYN
Are you homesick, James?
JAMES
No.
Evelyn runs her hand along the Jaguar's sleek lines. As she approaches, James can see a bruise
beneath her right eye. A wound the sunglasses cannot completely hide.
EVELYN
Tell me about Twin Peaks.
JAMES
(reticent)
There isn't much to say.
EVELYN
You could start with why you left. A woman, as I recall.
Two of them.
Evelyn's keeping it light. A gentle flirtation. James responds quietly, lets a secret out of his
heart.
JAMES
(after a long beat)
I loved a girl who died.
Evelyn stops still to face him.
JAMES (continued)
Her name was Laura. I thought I knew her but I didn't.
Nobody did.

EVELYN
I'm sorry.
JAMES
(the feelings rush back)
My life used to make sense, you know? I didn't like it
all the time. But it was mine and I felt like it belonged
to me. Then Laura died. And the whole world went
crazy. Suddenly my life belonged to something else.
To Laura. And no matter what I did, or how much I
tried to help, and I tried, I really did...
(beat)
Another girl died. And all I wanted to do was get on
my bike and ride as far away from Twin Peaks as it
would take me.
James pauses, deeply shaken. Evelyn steps to him, takes James into her arms. A long beat.
She whispers:
EVELYN
(genuine compassion)
I know the feeling, James. I know the feeling.
Their mouths come closer together, awkward, shy. They kiss. James gently removes her
sunglasses. He wants to see into her eyes. A long beat. James traces the bruise on her check
with his fingertips.
JAMES
Why do you let him hurt you?
Evelyn takes his hand, presses it against her lips. She will not answer. Instead, she kisses James
with great passion. Their embrace deepens. Suddenly: the SOUND of a car pulling up the drive.
Evelyn steps out of James' arms, looks to the main house. MALCOM steps out of a limousine,
pauses to shoot a warning glance in their direction. Then proceeds inside.
EVELYN
Jeffrey's leaving.
Evelyn turns back to James, whispers before leaving.
EVELYN
I need you. Will you help me?
Evelyn hurries out of the garage without waitin for an answer. HOLD ON James for a beat.
Considering his reply.

JOSIE
Harry.
TRUMAN
Two days, Josie. Two nights. And not a word.
JOSIE
I'm sorry.
TRUMAN
What the hell are you doing here?
JOSIE
(quiet and afraid)
This is my home.
TRUMAN
After everything you told me? Home with Catherine?!
JOSIE
I have no choice.
Josie turns from him, she cannot bear his gaze. But he reaches after, pulls her into his arms.
TRUMAN
Let me take care of you. Please.
JOSIE
Don't you understand? I'm safe here. And you are safe as
well.
TRUMAN
No.
JOSIE
(pulling free from his arms)
Look at me. I am Catherine Packard's maid.
(a quiet shudder)
Go away, Harry. I'm no good for you now.
Truman steps closer, he sees the servant's clothing, the tears that shine in her eyes.
TRUMAN
I want you. Good or bad. I don't care.

13. INT. GREAT NORTHERN CORRIDOR - DAY
AUDREY HORNE wanders down the corridor outside her father's office. She pauses, hears
Ben shouting inside.
BEN'S VOICE
Dammit, Longstreet. We may have come to this
godforsaken town in search of shoes, but we will leave it
with Grant on his knees, and our sights set on
Washington!
Audrey reacts, steps toward the office door.
CUT TO:
14. INT. GREAT NORTHERN HOTEL - DAY
Audrey enters, finds an amazing tableau within. BEN HORNE has transformed the floor of
his office into a huge diorama depicting the Battle of Gettysburg, complete with rolling hills,
tiny trees, miniature soldiers in uniform. And a chugging train that hoots about the periphery.
Lost in combat, Ben holds two toy soldiers, continues a conversation between them. Ben is
dressed in the requisite finery of a Southern General.
BEN
(as toy soldier, Longstreet)
Yessir, General Lee.
(as Lee)
Longstreet, I want you to lead the assault on the Round
Tops. Ewell will take Culp's Hill -
AUDREY
(can't believe her eyes and ears)
Daddy ... ?
BEN
(as Lee, raging)
Yes, Culp's Hill, are you deaf? And where's Jeb Stuart
and his calvary?! Damn his eyes!!
(as Longstreet)
Jeb's a-comin', Sir. I know it.
(as Lee)
He'd better be. For all our sakes. We meet the enemy
here. And we meet him by morning.
AUDREY

Horne freezes, looks up from battle. Wild-eyed and disheveled.

Suddenly it's daybreak.
AUDREY
What in the world are you doing?
BEN
THERE'S A CIVIL WAR GOING ON HERE.
AUDREY
(voice breaking, truly concerned)
War?
BEN
The war between the states. And who are you?
AUDREY
Audrey, your daughter, and you need some help.
BEN
Thank you but I just want to be left alone, this is an
important day.
AUDREY
This is an important day, alright, we've got a business to
save. You and me. And I am going to help you.
BEN
(a long pause)
Audrey?
AUDREY
(hopeful)
Yes, Daddy?
BEN
(back to the races)
You're standing on General Stuart.
She moves. Ben snatches the soldier from under her feet.
BEN
We spotted ol' Jeb, General Lee. He brought us a
hundred and twenty-five wagons.

father - and the Civil War - behind. Ben doesn't notice.

BIG ED HURLEY steps nervously about the living room, checks a clock on the knickknack
shelf. Just then: a KNOCK at the door. Ed answers it. Norma steps inside, still wearing her
Double R uniform. An awkward beat. Neither sure just what to say or do. Then:
ED
Norma, I've been thinking -
NORMA
(simultaneously)
Ed, I came here so I could -
ED
(after a beat)
You first.
NORMA
(deep breath, with loving surety)
Okay. When I go to bed, you're the last thing I think of.
When I wake up, you're the first thing on
my mind. I know the world's gone to pieces. And I
know it all seems designed to keep us apart. But there's
one thing bad luck never takes into account. We love
each other, Ed. And I think we have to stand up to that.
No matter what.
A beat. Ed takes her into his arms, they kiss deeply.
NORMA

START CLOSE on hands attaching a hidden microphone to a rather sweaty chest. A
protesting voice is heard. Ernie Niles.
ERNIE'S VOICE
Careful. Watch the chest hair. Ouch.
ANOTHER ANGLE reveals Sheriff Truman, Agent Cooper. And DEPUTY HAWK
fitting Niles with the wire, putting baby powder on his chest.
HAWK
(just an observation)
You're sweating like a pig, Mr. Niles.
NILES
(no offense taken)
I suffer from nervous perspiration. Hyperhidrosis. It's a
childhood condition. Though I never really noticed it
until the war ...
(oh what the hell, why not lie)
... Korea. I was leading a battalion toward the forty-
ninth parallel. Just a bunch of young, fresh-faced kids,
no idea what kind of hell we were about to step into -
COOPER
Ernie? Ernie, I want you focus on the here and now.
Repeat your instructions. Step by step.
ERNIE
(after a beat, a little hushed)
I take Denise up to Dead Dog Farm, introduce her to
Renault as a big-time buyer from Seattle. I lead
Renault through the buy. Complete the transaction. And
get the hell out of the way.
COOPER
Good. Harry? You'll take it from there.

gain.
COOPER
Thank you, Harry. I hope I can live up to it.
HAWK
I'm done. Might want to towel him off before we go.
ERNIE
(growing increasingly nervous)
Just how long will it take you to storm the farmhouse? I
mean from the time I complete the buy? Maybe I
should be wearing a vest. Can I ask a question?
TRUMAN
Sure, Ernie.
ERNIE
(entering collapse)
Don't make me do this. Please. I'm not the man you
think I am. I'm a coward. Really. This isn't my line of
work, I -
(he notices the stern looks from all)
I'm fine. Sorry. A momentary lapse. Count on me.
COOPER
(with a sigh, to Truman)
Where's Denise?
Just then: Denise, or rather Dennis, enters the room. She's reverted back to male dress for the
occasion, hair tied neatly back in a ponytail.
DENISE/DENNIS
Right here.

Somehow it seemed ... appropriate.
Cooper offers an unfazed thumbs up.

TREMAYNE'S VOICE

We may have to pick the lock. Tricky business, that.
Just then: the door opens, REVEALING Tremayne and Andy on the other side. Andy has

TREMAYNE

Voila. We enter.
ANDY
Where is everybody?
TREMAYNE
Lunch.

Here we are ... the case files.
Tremayne leafs through the cabinet, reading names as he goes.
TREMAYNE
Nails, Neaster, Neatherby, Needleman. Nicholas
Needleman. Our little Nicky.
ANDY

We can read it in the car.
TREMAYNE

Patience, Andrew ... Hmm. The usual background
information. Birthplace, initial adoption.
ANDY

HUSBAND
Hi. We're the Brunston's. I know we're a little early.
But we were just so damn eager to see him ...
(off their confusion)
Can we see him? Where is Donnie?
Speechless, Andy simply points at Tremayne. Tremayne faces the unexpected guests, replies:
TREMAYNE
(thinking on his feet)
Dead.
The husband pales, the wife gasps. Tremayne improvises further.
TREMAYNE
Dead tired, that is. I'm afraid Donnie isn't feeling up to
snuff.
HUSBAND
But he was in perfect health, yesterday.
ANDY

Dick.
TREMAYNE

DONNA
I need your help, Ed.
ED
What can I do for you?
DONNA
I've been looking for James everywhere. He hasn't been
in school. No one's seen him at the Diner. I even went
to his house but I can't find him.
ED
Donna. Listen to me. James is all right. He called.
DONNA (impassioned)
Tell me.
ED (taking out an envelope)
James asked me to send him some money care of a bar
out on 96. We didn't talk long ...
(showing envelope to her)
That's all I know.
Donna peers at the envelope for a beat. An address written there.
DONNA
Let me take it to him.
ED
What about your folks?
DONNA
I'll speak to them. They'll understand.
Ed's not so sure, but Donna doesn't hesitate. She gives Ed a kiss on the cheek, exits. Ed pauses,
turns back to the bedroom. Norma's standing in the doorway. Both listen to the sound of
Donna's car driving away.
NORMA

Oh, Ed. The things we do for love.
Hank SLAMS his fist into Ed's jaw. Ed topples over backward. Hank leaps upon him. He'll
beat him to death if he can. Just then: someone OPENS the front door. Norma returning?
No. It's Nadine, carrying a satchel of books. Thinking about Mike. Thinking about Ed.
Thinking about her parents in Europe.
NADINE
Eddie? I'm home!
Nadine SEES Hank and Big Ed. One looming over the other.
NADINE
Eddie?
Hank turns to Nadine, revealing Ed below him, face bloodied and battered. Nadine reacts in
a flash. She leaps forward, swings her book satchel like a scimitar, bashing Hank in the head.
Hank yowls in protest, tries to avoid. But Nadine is stronger and faster than his darkest
nightmare. And now she turns the full force of her anger upon him.
Nadine batters Hank through the living room, pile-driving into a coffee table, hurling
him through the knickknack shelf, and with one last great punch...sends him careening over the
sofa. A beat of stunned silence. Hank lies still. Nadine hurries to Big Ed's side.
NADINE
(cradling him in her arms)
Eddie? Can you hear me?
ED
(eyes fluttering open)
Nadine?
NADINE
Nadine's here. Don't worry, baby. Nadine will take
care of everything.

CUT TO:
26. INT. BEN HORNE'S OFFICE - DAY
A victorious Ben Horne, still in military raiment, eyes the battleground before him. Bobby
Briggs looks on with a sinking feeling. His big break is turning to sand before his eyes.
BEN
Colonel Chamberlain and the 20th Maine were trapped
at the summit of Little Round Top. A third of his men
already fallen. His one chance, his only chance, was to
take the offensive; to move his left flank down the
hillside, like a swinging gate and take us by surprise.
BOBBY (maybe he can break thru the fog)
Uh, Mr. Horne..?
BEN
But we were waiting for him. The 15th Alabama
attacked before the left flank was able to muster.
Chamberlain's desperate manuever ended in failure
(an arm around Bobby)
Little Round Top was ours. From this vantage point, we
were able to roll back the Federal line, setting the stage
for Pickett's mighty charge. And victory.
BOBBY
Victory. Oh boy.
Bobby looks to the door, Audrey peeking inside. He shrugs. What can I do? Meanwhile, Ben
produces a sword from behind his desk, hands it to Bobby with great fanfare.
BEN
General Meade, you have suffered in ignoble defeat. I
accept your unconditional surrender.
Bobby doesn't know what the hell to do. Ben wants him to hand the sword back.
BEN
General Meade. I accept your unconditional surrender.
BOBBY
(backing from the room)
Okay. Tell you what, Mr. Horne, I gotta go check with
President Lincoln first, okay? So you wait right here,

Bobby makes a hasty exit, holding the sword.
CUT TO:
27. INT. GREAT NORTHERN CORRIDOR - DAY
Bobby exits from the office carrying the ceremonial sword, finds Audrey outside. They walk
down the corridor together.
BOBBY
Baby, I got good news and I got bad news. The bad
news is your old man just bought a condo in Flip City.
Ben is out to lunch. The good news is he's about to win
the Civil War.
AUDREY
(wheels already turning)
I'll call Uncle Jerry. He'Il know what to do. And
Doctor Jacoby. Maybe he needs an injection. Bobby, I
don't care what it takes: we've got to get Ben Horne back
on his feet again.
BOBBY
(willing to play along)
Okay, baby. Whatever you say. Bobby's on the case.
That may work with Shelly. But not this girl. She deadpans:
AUDREY
Don't call me baby.
They turn the corner. Catherine Martell, who's overheard some of the exchange, steps around
the corner and heads for the office.

The door opens ... Catherine Martell steps inside.
CATHERINE
Hello, Ben.
Ben reacts. She's a walking reality check, tearing Ben from fantasy's comforting embrace.
BEN
Catherine.
CATHERINE
(pause, eyes on diorama, an educated guess)
Gettysburg?
BEN
(uncertain how to greet her)
Yes ...
CATHERINE
(accurately interpreting the battle results)
Only you could conceive of winning the Civil War. For the South.
BEN
I have Washington in my sights.
CATHERINE
You have the nuthouse in your future if you don't snap out
of it.
BEN
(reluctantly considering reality)
So you've come to gloat. Come to celebrate my
demise. Go ahead, then. Laugh. You've defeated me.
Left me for dead. As I have defeated General Meade.
There's something wistful in Ben's expression. A kind of vulnerability Catherine's never seen
before. Catherine looks at Ben for a beat. Then, a little wistful herself.
CATHERINE
True. I did come here to gloat. You double-crossed me.
You tried to kill me. And I, for the very best of reasons,
intended to bury you so deeply that future generations
would someday unearth and exhibit your remains:
Slimey Rat Bastard Americanus: DO NOT FEED.
DO NOT TRUST.

I'm not all that trustworthy, I suppose.
CATHERINE
Far from it. And yet, despite all the things I know,
despite every reason you've given me to despise you ... I
find myself here with you ... wanting you.
BEN
You can't be serious ...
CATHERINE
I want you, Ben. Horrifying as it seems. I can't escape
it. You ... make my body hum.
Ben looks at her, speechless. Catherine reaches for him.
CATHERINE
Now kiss me, General Lee.
Catherine pushes Ben down upon the soft couch. Both sides engage.

29. EXT. MARSH GARAGE - DAY
Evelyn stands outside the garage, holding a bottle of champagne and two glasses. Eyes closed,
she waits; giddy, impatient.
EVELYN
(teasing)
Hurry up, "Jim." The champagne's getting warm.
JAMES' VOICE
(from inside the garage)
Don't call me "Jim."
Suddenly: the ROAR of an engine from the garage. Evelyn opens her eyes. And James drives
into view behind the wheel of the gleaming Jaguar. Evelyn holds the champagne and glasses
into the air, triumphant. James pulls up beside her. He opens the passenger door, steps into
view. Presents the automobile with a grinning flourish.
JAMES
Anyplace special you want to go?
EVELYN
(in kind)
Jeffrey'll be home by midnight. That doesn't give us a
lot of time.

I'll take what we got.
EVELYN

Deal.
James and Evelyn meet at the front of the Jaguar. The engine running. Evelyn pours two
glasses, hands one to James. They touch glasses. Evelyn proposes a toast.
EVELYN
(not coy)
To handsome strangers and rebuilt engines.
James downs his glass with a flourish. Evelyn grins, does the same.
EVELYN
I never thought I'd see it ride again. You're a miracle-
worker.
JAMES
It was nothing. Honest.
EVELYN
You're too modest.
JAMES
I don't want to brag.
EVELYN
(keeping it light)
Oh, go ahead. You deserve it. You're strong and you're
kind. You have a wonderfully honest face, James. Don't
laugh, it's quite rare. Every time I look at you, I can tell
exactly what you're thinking.
JAMES
Guess I ought to be careful about what I'm thinking.
EVELYN
(shifting emotional gears)
Don't be careful. Not on my account.
Evelyn pours herself another glass, hands the bottle to James.
EVELYN
What are your plans?

I don't know.
EVELYN
(quiet confession)
Don't.
JAMES
What?
EVELYN
(now looking into his eyes)
I don't want you to leave. Give me time, James. I'll
think of a hundred reasons for you to stay.
Evelyn kisses him. Their passion increases. James begins to remove her blouse. Evelyn reaches
for his belt. James eases her down upon on the Jaguar hood, the engine still running hot beneath
them. Evelyn smiles, giddy, she whispers:
EVELYN
(re engine)
It 's warm.
HOLD ON James and Evelyn for a beat. ANOTHER ANGLE reveals Malcolm watching
from the garage. And he's smiling.

Deputy Hawk sits in a police cruiser, wearing a headset, manning the radio and taping controls.

ERNIE'S VOICE
You sure you don't want to wait for Hank? He told me
this morning how much he wanted to be in on everything.
I feel pretty strongly we should wait a couple more -
RENAULT'S VOICE
We'll start without him.
ERNIE'S VOICE
(instant collapse)
Whatever you say. Dennis ... ?
DENNIS'S VOICE
May I?
RENAULT'S VOICE
(suspicious)
You're sweating awful bad, Professor. Something wrong?
ERNIE'S VOICE
(lying because he can)
Me? Sweating? Hyperhidrosis. It's a childhood
condition. I was living in Guam at the time, contracted
yellow fever. The. aftereffects are vicious, as you can
imagine, heavy sweating's one of the socially
inconvenient -
DENNIS'S VOICE
(hoping to distract)
Everything's in order. I've got a plane to catch, so if we
can finish up...
KING'S VOICE
Sit down, Ernie. Take a deep breath.
RENAULT'S VOICE
(boring in on Niles)
A man needs to learn the art of relaxation. Life is a
precious commodity. Why waste it running headlong
into the future? Pause. Enjoy each moment as it passes.
Treadmills are for lab rats.
ERNIE'S VOICE
(a babbled plea)
I don't sweat like this all the time. I was in Korea, we
were just a bunch of fresh-faced kids ...
Suddenly: a crackling BUZZ, static emanating from the wire. Ernie's sweat has caused a short.
Chaos follows, sounds of panic, footsteps shuffling, Ernie's muffled pleas.

COOPER

They're in trouble.
Suddenly: the wire goes dead. Not a sound to be heard. Truman reaches for his headset, as if
to adjust. Hawk runs into view.
HAWK
The wire's dead.
Cooper turns back to his binoculars, gazes at the farmhouse below.
THROUGH THE BINOCULARS
Nothing at first. Perhaps some tumult glimpsed through a window. Then, suddenly, the front
door bursts open - it's Jean Renault, pushing Dennis Bryson into view, holding him tight,
pressing a gun into his ear. As hostage. Renault bellows:
RENAULT
COOPER!!!

RENAULT
COOPER!!
Cooper and Truman exchange a look. A beat. And Cooper steps forward, out of hiding.
TRUMAN
Coop!
COOPER
He came for me, Harry.
Cooper steps from the bluff toward Jean Renault. Truman turns to Hawk.
TRUMAN
(the man of action)
Get Capability on the radio. I want backup.
HAWK
State police?
TRUMAN
The Bookhouse Boys.
Hawk races back to the cruiser. Below, Cooper nears the farmhouse and Renault.
RENAULT
I want safe passage to the border.
COOPER
I'm not authorized to deal.
RENAULT
Then bring me someone who is.
COOPER
First, release your hostages.
RENAULT
Why?
COOPER
(matter of fact)
We will kill you if you don't.

No. We will trade.
RENAULT
Trade?
COOPER
Your hostages. Ernie Niles and Agent Bryson. For me.
Renault figures. It's what he wanted after all. Finally ... Renault smiles, nods assent.
RENAULT
Agreed.
(loosening his grip on Bryson)
Hands in the air, Agent Cooper. Come to me.
HIGH ANGLE
Cooper raises his hands, takes lonely steps toward Jean Renault, the farmhouse. Renault
releases Bryson. Shoves Ernie Niles after.

CAMERA REVEALS Malcom standing below, waiting for her. Evelyn smiles sleepily
Malcom returns a grin.
MALCOM
How's our baby boy?
EVELYN
Sound asleep. Dreaming of love.
MALCOM
Lucky, lucky, lucky.
Malcom opens his arms. Evelyn eases into them. They exchange a deep and lasting kiss.

35. INT. DEAD DOG FARM - NIGHT
Cooper and Renault sit opposite each other inside. Renault keeps his pistol trained on Cooper.
Preston King paces about, nervous, he peers out a window.
KING
More deputies. Sharpshooters. Let's deal. Or let's run.
King is starting to panic. But not Renault. He remains calm, quietly philosophical.
RENAULT
Will they let us run, Agent Cooper?
COOPER
No.
RENAULT
Will they deal?
COOPER
I doubt it.
RENAULT
(with a sigh)
What do you suggest we do?
COOPER
Surrender.
RENAULT
I agree.
KING
Are you crazy?
RENAULT
(waving him off with the gun)
There is only one thing left to decide. To surrender
quietly. Or to kill you first.

RENAULT

COOPER
Is my death so important?
RENAULT
My brothers are dead. I hold you responsible.
COOPER
(stating the facts, not a plea)
I met Bernard once. As for Jacques, I arrested him,
nothing more.
RENAULT
But I blame you, Agent Cooper.
COOPER
Why?
RENAULT
Before you came here, Twin Peaks was a simple place.
My brothers sold drugs to truck-drivers and teenagers.
One-Eyed Jack's welcomed curious tourists and
businessmen. Quiet people lived quiet lives. Then a
pretty girl dies. And you arrive. Everything changes.
My brother Bernard is shot and left to die in the woods.
A grieving father smothers my surviving brother with a
pillow. Arson, kidnapping. More death and
destruction. Suddenly the quiet people here are no
longer quiet. Their simple dreams have become a
nightmare.
(shifts his grip on the pistol, as if he now meant
to shoot a hole in Cooper's chest)
What's one more death, after all? Maybe yours will be
the last. Maybe you brought the nightmare with you.
Renault is toying with Cooper, spinning words into ideas. But there is something eerily
accurate about his playful philosophizing. King is unimpressed.
KING
I don't know what the hell you think you're talkin' about.
But I do know that we have a goddam problem and if
you don't want to solve it. I will -
(stops at the window, stares outside. Open-
mouthed)
Jean? You want to take a look at this?
Renault gets up, steps to the window. Keeping an eye on Cooper all the while. He joins King,
peers outside.

36. WHAT THEY SEE
Improbably, impossibly, a WAITRESS from the Double R Diner sashays toward the
farmhouse, holding a tray aloft into the night air. It's a surreal image, the waitress caught in
the glaring jeep lights, stepping closer, steam rising off the food above her.
35. BACK TO SCENE
KING
(looking out the window)
You order food?
King draws his gun as if to fire. But Renault stops him.
RENAULT
Let her come.
Cooper follows their exchange intently, looks toward the door. A beat. And someone knocks
three times. Renault steps to open it. Standing in the doorway, tray held aloft, is Dennis - or
rather Denise Bryson, in full Double R regalia.
DENISE
Suppertime.
Several things happen simultaneously; Jean looks closer at the waitress, dimly recognizes the
face. Denise lets the tray drop down to her waist, revealing a gun upon it. In one smooth
motion she hurls the pistol toward Cooper, even as he leaps forward out of his chair. Jean turns
to fire at Cooper. Denise drops Preston King with a right cross to the jaw.
Cooper shoots Renault through the heart. Sheriff Truman and Deputy Hawk pour inside, guns
ready. Both spot Renault dead on the floor. Denise cuffing Preston King. They lower their
weapons. A beat, then:
COOPER
Quick thinking, Denise.
DENISE
Don't thank me. Thank Sheriff Truman. It was his idea.
Cooper turns to Harry. Surprised, proud. He smiles.
COOPER
Harry S. Truman.
TRUMAN

Shelly sleeps curled up on the living room sofa. Still waiting for Bobby to come home. A
record plays on a stereo turntable nearby. Something soft and sweet. Then, suddenly, the
house lights FLICKER, the record begins to slow. The sweet tune distorts eerily. Shelly
wakes with a start.
SHELLY
(sleepy)
Bobby?
The lights FLICKER with greater intensity, now blacking out for seconds at a time. Shelly
slips off the sofa, steps toward the kitchen. Now afraid.
SHELLY
(whispered, hoping)
Bobby, is that you? This isn't funny.
Shelly comes upon Leo's bed revealed in the flickering light. She gasps. The bed is empty.
SHELLY
(her fear increases)
Bobby?
Shelly pivots, looks toward Leo's wheelchair. The wheelchair is empty.
SHELLY
Bobby!!
Shelly whirls about, hysterical. That's when she SEES him. Leo Johnson standing across the
room, swathed in shadow and light. Shelly SCREAMS. And the lights cease their flickering,
the house is plunged into absolute darkness.

OPEN ON the station interior. Pitch black, no lights anywhere. A beat. And LUCY
MORAN leads Cooper, Truman, and Hawk inside. Truman holds a flashlight toward the
dark, pauses to listen to Lucy. Cooper continues ahead.
LUCY
The voice on the phone said there was a bomb planted in
the woods but it didn't say which woods and then all of a
sudden there was this big BANG and the lights went out
and I couldn't find a candle so I called the fire
department.

TRUMAN
Was there a fire?
LUCY
Two of them. First there was one at the power station.
But most of the volunteer fire department was playing
bingo so it took a while to get everybody together.
Then there was the bang I told you about. It sounded
like it was right upstairs so we all got out of here.
Well, it turned out to be the transformer on the pole
right above and behind the building but we had to wait
to go back inside because the transformer was shooting
sparks everywhere and we were afraid it would start the
station on fire, too. But it didn't.
TRUMAN
Do they know what started it, Lucy?
LUCY
"Suspicious in nature," that's what Chief Kipple said. He was suffering
from smoke inhalation at the time so he sounded a little hoarse -
Suddenly Cooper's voice is heard in the dark.
COOPER'S VOICE
Harry!
Truman looks up, notices that Cooper and Hawk have proceeded ahead.
TRUMAN
Yeah, Coop?
COOPER'S VOICE
(grave)
You'd better take a look at this.
TRUMAN
(to Lucy)
Stay here.
Truman steps toward Cooper's voice. CAMERA FOLLOWS Truman, the flashlight's beam,
as he enters the office.
TRUMAN
Cooper?
Truman stops still. The flashlight's beam tracks across the office floor, REVEALS Cooper and
Hawk standing by Harry's desk, eyes turned toward his chair. Truman shifts, aims the flashlight
to follow their gaze ...
... and reveals a horrifying tableau. A DEAD MAN seated in the chair, eyes frozen wide in an
agonizing stare, mouth taped shut as if to silence screams. Before him, arrayed atop the desk, a
chess board. The dead man's hand has been set upon a knight, as if to make his next move.
