POLICE CARS in the driveway.
CUT TO:
2. INT. MARSH HOUSE, VESTIBULE IN FRONT OF THE STAIRS - NIGHT
A COP stands at the door with MALCOLM. A few other COPS look around the house.
EVELYN MARSH sits on the steps behind them playing the grieving widow.
COP
His room is completely empty.
MALCOLM
He's a drifter. I'm sure he was long gone once Mr. Marsh
pulled out of the driveway.
COP
Would you know his full name?
MALCOLM
I barely knew the kid. Jim... ah, Jim -
EVELYN
(from across the room)
James Hurley. He said he was from Twin Peaks.
COP
Work here long?
MALCOLM
Mrs. Marsh hired him to fix the Jaguar.
COP
How did you meet him, Mrs. Marsh?
EVELYN
Jeffrey's Jaguar broke down near Wally's. I went inside
to use the phone and he offered to help.
COP
We'll check there.
(moves to the door)
Thanks.
Malcolm shows them out. Closing the door he walks to Evelyn.

MALCOLM
And so we bid adieu to James Hurley.
EVELYN
Give it a rest.
MALCOLM
Careful, Evelyn. I really couldn't tolerate a nervous co-
conspirator.
EVELYN
I just want it over with, alright?
MALCOLM
Whatever you say, Mrs. Marsh.
Evelyn turns her back on him. Malcolm laughs and walks up the stairs.

3. INT. WALLY'S BAR - NIGHT
JAMES and DONNA slide quietly, nervously into a booth in the bar.
DONNA
We can't get out of this by ourselves, James. We've got
to get someone to help us.
JAMES
But I didn't do anything. Malcolm killed Mr. Marsh.
I'm being framed
DONNA
It doesn't make any difference. We can't just wait for
cops to catch us. I think you should call Big Ed.
JAMES
No, my only chance is to talk to Evelyn. If she told me
this was a set up, maybe she'll tell the police, too.
DONNA
You wouldn't have a chance. The police will be waiting
for you. We've got to keep moving.
JAMES
But she'd listen to me. I know she would.
DONNA
(suspecting it all)
Would she? Why?

His look tells her about his relationship with Evelyn.
DONNA
I'm gonna call Ed. Stay here.
Donna moves quickly to the phone. Dials. It takes awhile for ED to answer.
DONNA
Ed, it's Donna. I don't have much time. James is in lots
of trouble. He was working for this woman, repairing a
car and there was an accident - James thinks -
The COP from the Marsh House enters the bar. Donna stares at the cop and then at James who
also watches the cop. James slides out of the bar. Donna is about to run after him when the
Cop moves suspiciously towards her. She changes the subject.
DONNA
- so, tell me about your new boyfriend, Janie - he's
really cure, isn't he? He lettered in football? What
position does he play?
The cop walks over to the bartender. They are obviously talking about James. MOVE BACK
to the receiver sitting on top the pay phone. Donna is gone. On the other end is Ed's voice.
ED'S VOICE

Shelly and Bobby sit in chairs across the table from Cooper and Truman. Mid-interrogation
with Bobby getting steamed.
TRUMAN
What were you doing at Shelly's house last night, Bobby?
BOBBY
I almost get killed and suddenly I'm on trial.

BOBBY
Here's the deal. Shelly and I are together, okay? We
have been for a long time, since before Laura died.
Before and after Leo went into his drool mode.
COOPER
(sees an opening)
Bobby, where were you the night the mill burned?
BOBBY
What's that got to do with this?
TRUMAN
Leo tried to kill you. Maybe you shot him that night.
BOBBY
No way. I went to Shelly's house the night of the fire
because I was worried about her. Leo was waiting for
me. He was about to play Paul Bunyan on me when Hank
Jennings shot him through the window.
TRUMAN
You sure it was Hank?
BOBBY
Absolutely.
COOPER
Is this true Shelly?
SHELLY
Yes.

COOPER
What about the insurance money?
BOBBY
Just a happy accident. I figure Leo owed us that.
TRUMAN
Where do you think Leo went?
BOBBY
You tell me.
Bobby has no intention of saying anything else.
TRUMAN
That will be all for now, Bobby. Shelly you be careful.
As Shelly and Bobby leave they bump into ALBERT ROSENFIELD in the doorway.
Cooper is genuinely happy to see him.
COOPER
Albert.
ALBERT
Another trip on the Seattle to Twin Peaks Shuttle. I'll
confess to you gentlemen, coming down here today I
toyed with singing "Ninety-Nine Bottles of Beer on the
Wall."
(opens his briefcase and drops a picture of Earle
on the table)
My invite back to Twin Peaks. Direct orders from
Gordon Cole. As he so succinctly put it,
(shouts like Cole)
"I'M WORRIED ABOUT COOP.
(spreads out a map, pointing out a pattern
marked on it)
Biloxi, Houston, Oklahoma City, Salina, Lincoln,
Chicago. Earle's been sending gift wrapped packages to
police departments and offices of major law
enforcement agencies. Each look like mail bombs, but
turn out to be harmless. Deliveries are paid for with
phony credit cards signed "Windom Earle." Cole's
doing the follow up on this. He should run up here after
that.

ALBERT
One article of clothing in each.
(shows photos)
A white net veil, a garter, a pair of white slippers, a
string of pearls, and, finally, a wedding dress.
COOPER
Caroline ...
ALBERT
He's got the DEA, FBI, Treasury, Postal Service and
the Mississippi, Oklahoma, and Illinois state patrols
looking for him. Invited all of them to the party, but
my guess is he won't dance with anyone but you, Coop.
Cooper is unnerved. Albert retrieves more work from his case.
ALBERT
The vagrant in the office died from a knife wound
severing the aorta. He'd been dead for two days.
TRUMAN
But it's finger was pointing to the chess board? How did
he manage that with the rigamortis?
ALBERT
Rigamortis goes from head to toe but after two days
leaves the body toe to head. Earle waited for it to leave
the arms and fingers so that he could maneuver them on
the chess board.
(moving on)
And then he played Zeus at the power station.
COOPER
How do you know?
ALBERT
He left us this map. Taped under a table.

Cooper moves away from the map. Stares our the window. Albert worries for his friend.
ALBERT
(picks up a piece off the chess game)
He's making his move. Most definitely.
Albert moves to the door. Tries to cheer Cooper up.
ALBERT (CONTINUED)
About the uniform, Coop. Replacing the elegance of the
dark suit and tie with the casual indifference of a mouse
brown work outfit is a form of fashion suicide, but, call
me crazy, I like it.
Albert goes out. Truman studies the frightened Cooper.

6. INT. WINDOM EARLE'S CABIN - DAY
LEO JOHNSON in bed with his wounds from the night before freshly dressed. WINDOM
EARLE sits next to him playing an antique wooden flute. Five stainless steel square suitcases
rest near him. The chess board is set up on the table. A small school desk sits by the door.
On one wall is a Earle's high tech command module - computer, modem, monitoring
devices, police scanners. Leo awakes to the haunting flute music.
EARLE
Ah, you are awake, then.
(stands over him)
I trust you've slept well.
(goes to his computer returns with Leo's picture
and a police APB)
While you slept I've learned all about you.

The police would like to see you as soon as possible.

EARLE (continued)
"Drug trafficking, arson, attempted murder."
(studies the next item)
"Domestic violence." I'm partial to that.
Leo tries to make a bolt for the door. Earle slams his wound with his flute. Leo falls back.
EARLE
Well, Leo, I have cleansed your wounds. You're on the
mend. I've removed the proverbial thorn from your paw.
(tasting this)
Leo. Leo the Lion.
(plays a trill on the flute)
I want you to help me. And obey me. Will you do
that?
Leo hesitates. Earle shows the flute to Leo.
EARLE
In thirteenth century Japan the Samurai were stripped of
their weaponry. But they discovered that the aged and
treated bamboo of their Shaku hachi flute made an
excellent cudgel.
(smacks Leo again, then walks back to the table)
This flute is truly an instrument of pleasure, don't you
think?
Leo tries to make a run for it, but merely allows Earle to have more fun with his flute. It ends
with Earle standing over Leo near the doorway. He takes a dog collar out of his coat.
EARLE
I wanted to save this necklace for an "occasion," but now
you've ruined it.
He wraps the collar around Leo's neck. Attached is a round object that looks like a beer can.
EARLE
Now, come over here. I've made you some gruel.
As Earle returns to the table, Leo scrambles for the door. He stops short. Struggling with an
electrical shock coming from the collar. He falls backwards. Stunned. Earle sits at his table.
EARLE
Come here, Leo. Come on.
Leo struggles towards the table as Earle plays his flute.

7. INT. HURLEY HOUSE - DAY
ED HURLEY and NORMA JENNINGS lie in bed. Norma snuggles next to Ed.
ED
Almost twenty years, Norma. One day we're talking
about a graduation party and the next day we're here. In
between nothing but hurt.
NORMA
I tried not to think about it. Spent more and more time
in the diner trying to make the place work because there
was nothing else. We were open everyday so that I
wouldn't have another life. No birthdays, no Fourth of
July, no Christmas.
ED
I turned all my Christmases into a week full of
Mondays. When that didn't work I'd spend my time
thinking about presents I never got to buy you. Never got
to give you.
NORMA
I bought you a present last Christmas. An onyx and
turquoise bolo tie. I walked over to your house to give it
to you, but I just stood there and waited to see you
through a window. I should have just walked right in. I
don't know why I didn't. I'm sorry I didn't.
ED
All the time that you should have been in my home. My
bed.
NORMA
It's about the future now, Ed, and what we are going to
do about it.
(kisses him)
I want you to pick me up after I close the diner, tonight,
and I want you to take me home.
ED
You're right, it's all ahead of us.
They kiss again.

Norma scrambles to get her clothes on, but Ed stops her.
ED
Don't Norma. I may as well talk to her now.
Before they can get up, NADINE HURLEY walks into the room. She sits dejectedly on the
bed. She carries a trophy.
ED
Hello, Nadine.
NADINE
Got all the way to the District Finals at Knife River
only to find out the airplane slam is illegal. I was
disqualified.
(holds up the trophy)
Second Place. What a drag.
ED
(scrambling)
That's a tough break, alright.
Nadine stares at Norma for a moment.
NORMA
Hello, Nadine.
NADINE
I owe you an apology, Norma. I mean I really pounded
Hank and I am sorry. But I thought he was going to do
something to Eddie and I sort of got mad.
NORMA
Thank you.
Nadine gets up and walks to the door. Turns back.
NADINE

I know about you guys. And it's really, really okay.

So you two should do whatever you want. I am
completely cool about all of this. Really.
Nadine slowly exits leaving a baffled Norma and Ed.

8. INT. BLUE PINE LODGE OFFICE - DAY
Truman and Cooper sit across a table from JOSIE PACKARD who is in her maid's outfit.
The newspaper clipping with Jonathan's picture lies between them.
TRUMAN
Josie, this is it. I have to tell the police in Seattle
something. They asked me to question you. They know
you're connected with Jonathan.
JOSIE
How did he die? Was it a robbery?
COOPER
(pressing the point)
He was shot three times in the back of the head.
Josie begins to cry. Uneasy, Cooper checks his coffee cup
COOPER
I think I'll get another cup of joe.
Cooper walks to the kitchen area. Truman presses Josie.

If you were ever going to tell the truth, Josie, this would
be an ideal time.

COOPER
Hello, Pete.
PETE
(perturbed)
I get over to the "Clean and Save" and Jeanie Pombelek was working
the counter. She doesn't speak a word of English. Nada. Zip. She's
from Budapest. We just stood there and looked at each other like we
were made of wood.
Something in the laundry catches Cooper's eye.
COOPER
Who does all this belong to?
PETE
(confidential)
Catherine's runnin' her into the ground so I offered to stop by
the dry cleaner and pick up Josie's stuff.
(back to his problem)
The only words I know in Hungarian are paprika and goulash.
It took me twenty minutes to get this stuff.
Cooper takes a COAT out of the dry cleaning.
COOPER
This is Josie's?
PETE
Yep.
The phone rings. Pete answers it.
PETE
Hello ... Just a minute.

It's for Josie, she here?
COOPER

Pete moves into the next room.
PETE'S VOICE
Josie, it's for you.
Cooper moves quickly to the coat and taking out his pocket knife cuts away a small piece of
fabric from the Vicuna coat. He then opens the coat and there are a pair of gloves pinned to
the hanger. He takes the gloves.

BEN HORNE talks to a stunned group of HOTEL STAFF. He sits on a saddle draped over
a STUFFED HORSE. Young JOHNNY HORNE stands nearby, arms folded, Indian
headdress on, mind blank and jumbled. DR. JACOBY stands to one side. Observing.
BEN
So I said to Stonewall Jackson. "What would you like
to do when we run the Yanks up to Canada?" And he says,
"Follow them. I'd like to be the Duke of Montreal."
And I say to Stonewall, "Then we'd have to fight the
French?" And then he just gives me that Stonewall look
of his and says, 'What are we waiting for?"
Ben laughs heartily. Johnny gives a hearty howl. The Hotel staff reacts with ashen silence.
Jacoby walks to the back of the room to confer with a bemused JERRY HORNE and a
concerned AUDREY.
AUDREY
What do you think, Dr. Jacoby?
JACOBY
Letting him out to mingle with the public does not seem
to have helped.

Sorry, I'm late boss.

I asked Stonewall what I should do with Lincoln and he
said, "Honest Abe is going to be about as useful to you

SHELLY
I don't know, I guess I could start ... now.

Excuse me, Norma? Can I talk to you for a minute?

table. They converse, run forks through salads on fine china.
ECKHARDT

I must confess I received your invitation with some
surprise.
CATHERINE
Word travels fast in Twin Peaks. It seemed fitting that
I dine with my late brother's business rival. Some wine,
Josie.
Eckhardt listens to Catherine's charter, now looks up at Josie as she steps toward them
ECKHARDT
(an easy charm)
Your brother was not always my rival. We were friends.
Andrew was a witty, intelligent, and charming man.
Plaudits no doubt employed to describe his sister as well.
CATHERINE

I wonder, Mister Eckhardt. When you had him killed,
was it for art or money? Don't stand there, Josie, pour.
Josie nearly drops her bottle of wine. But Eckhardt betrays no reaction. He simply turns his
gaze from Josie to Catherine. Catherine's playing a dangerous game. Eckhardt will play
along ... for now. Josie pours blood-red wine into crystal glasses with a shaking hand.
ECKHARDT
(a gentle tone)
Call me Thomas. Your brother did.
CATHERINE
Thomas. We'll have the h'or d'ouerves now, Josie.
Josie moves off to fetch them. As the conversation continues:
ECKHARDT
One does not kill for art or money. They are
commodities easily lost, but just as easily gained.
However, one -
(small smile, moving from general to particular)
- rather, I, would find reason to kill for love.
CATHERINE
Did you love her that much?
Josie returns, offering a tray of canapes. Eckhardt's tone has been cratonic throughout. But now
he pauses. looks at Josie. Takes a small confection from the tray. And speaks quietly:
ECKHARDT
Yes.
Eckhardt pops the canape in his mouth. Josie nearly drops the tray. Catherine speaks evenly, as
if describing a prized possession.
CATHERINE

Josie has the most incredible hands. They effect a sort
of porcelain grace. Each finger a thing of beauty.

(eyes to Josie, effecting neutrality)
You've come so far to Twin Peaks. It would be a shame
to leave us empty-handed.
ECKHARDT
It would.
CATHERINE
On the other hand, Josie is almost completely
untrustworthy. She'll betray you again. And again.
ECKHARDT
I have managed to find pleasure in even that repetition.
CATHERINE
Of course I'll miss her cheery disposition. We've
become the very best of friends. Two girls chatting over
tea ...
ECKHARDT
Perhaps you should purchase an animal of some kind. A
cat or a dog.

But if I give her to you. What will you give me in

Why did you do it?
Evelyn reacts, startled. James steps out of the black.

I did it all. Everything. I found you I lured you in.
And I kept you here while Malcom planned a nice, neat

EVELYN
For the money. Out of fear. Because I wanted to.
Her words chill him. James' anger subsides. He expected excuses, regret. Anything but this.
EVELYN
That's not exactly what you want to hear, is it, James?
The truth hurts. I know.
James stares into her eyes. Evelyn moves closer. The truth hurts her too:
EVELYN
You're good and you're honest. I'm not. But that doesn't

Malcolm speaks quietly, words for Evelyn to commit to memory. Her story, her alibi, a tale

26. INT. WINDOM EARLE'S CABIN - NIGHT
A fire burns in the hearth casting warm light about the cabin. Windom Earle peers into a
mirror, carefully affixes a false mustache to his face, other concealing facial hair. He speaks
aloud as he prepares his disguise:
EARLE
Work slowly and with care. Everything must be written
in a steady, uncompromising hand.
Leo sits at a small wooden school desk, concentrates on a piece of writing paper before him.
He painstakingly copies from an open book of poetry, produces a version in his own hand. The
shock-collar still hangs about his neck. Earle steps behind him, peers over Leo's shoulder. He
uses his flute as a yard stick or marker.
EARLE
No, no, no. Terrible.
(pointing to offending section)
Erase.
Earle produces the shock collar control, presses a button. A low-grade SHOCK shivers
through Leo's body. Leo reacts with a shudder. Then erases in haste, looks up at Earle with
plaintive expression.
EARLE
Now. Try again. Concentrate.
Leo looks back to the paper. As if it was responsible for the shocks that course through him.
He puts pen to paper. But he errs again.
EARLE
(with manic disgust)
Oh, Leo. For heaven's sake.
Another stinging shock. Leo turns, as if to flee. But Earle is upon him. He grabs Leo's hand in
an iron grip.
EARLE
Let me show you.
Earle guides Leo's hand to the paper. And carefully leads him through the difficult section.
There is something odd and tender about Earle's actions. As teacher to pupil. Father to son.

Leo looks up it Earle, eager to curry his favor, whispers.
LEO
Windom ... Earle...
EARLE
(pleased)
Yes. Windom.
Earle picks up Leo's work. THREE child-like VALENTINES. In the center of each heart is
a picture: Shelly, Donna, and Aubrey. They are surveillance photos. Leo has written their
names on each valentine.
EARLE
Pretty words for pretty girls. Which one will be my
Queen?
LEO
(fairly mindless repetition)
Queen ...
Earle carefully tears the page into vertical thirds . Leo reacts with a protesting groan.
LEO
No...
Earle looks at him sharply. Leo cowers at his school-desk. Earle produces three identical
envelopes, one for each torn third.

A surreal tableau follows. Grant's surrender as enacted by Ben Horne (as the victorious General
Lee), Dr. Jacoby (as the vanquished General Grant), Jerry Horne (as Wilmer McLean), Aubrey

Ben pauses, midroom, surveys the small table at its center, the players grouped about him.
Aubrey steps forward with a smile.
AUDREY

Welcome to our humble home, General Lee.
BEN
Thank you. You are ...?
AUDREY

Aubrey gestures toward Jerry in his farmer's suit. But Jerry misses his cue, stands frozen with
stage fright. So Aubrey repeats:
AUDREY
(a little louder)
This is my father.
Jerry reacts, hurries forward, still clutching Ben's sword.
JERRY
(the world's worst southern accent)
Wilmer McLean at your service. I'm indeed honored to
make your extremely suitable acquaintance.

BEN
Why are you armed with my sword?

An awkward beat. Jacoby remains in hiding. Someone's missed their cue. Jerry looks at
Aubrey. Aubrey frowns, shoots a look at Bobby. Bobby plays a hasty toot on the bugle. The
cue Jacoby's been waiting for. A beat. And he steps forward, with as much diginity as
stepping from behind a curtain allows, into the room. Ben reacts to the odd entrance, ignores
it. And extends a hand.
BEN
General Grant.
JACOBY

Please, gentlemen. Sit down.
She gestures toward the small round table. They sit.
BEN
We once met during the Mexican War. Do you

sticking to the script)
I have come to surrender the North.
Ben reacts. Is he the only sane man in the room?

But as for the men who fight them...
(living the moment)
Well. They have my eternal respect and sympathy.

Very well, General. Enough fruitless conversation. My

general possessions. Officers and men claiming to own
horses may keep them too. And each officer and man
will be allowed to return to his home, not to be
disturbed by the Confederate States' authorities.
JACOBY

I surrender.
Ben pauses. Rewriting history wasn't supposed to be like this. He sighs.

Ben looks about, no paper on the desk. Jerry hurries forward, having missed his cue.

Jacoby signs. He hands the pen to Ben. Ben signs as well. Jerry reveals a harmonica, begins to
PLAY the Battle Hymn of the Republic in the background.
BOBBY AND AUDREY look on from the perimeter. Bobby turns to Aubrey.
BOBBY
(sotto voce)
I thought the North won the Civil War...
Aubrey rolls her eyes. Ben and Jacoby stand, shake hands a second time. Jerry steps closer,
playing loudly now. Ben gets fully into the spirit of the moment, tears gather in his eyes, he's
at the pinnacle again, he's triumphed over inestimable odds ... and FAINTS dead away.

Jerry, Jacoby, and Aubrey gather about the fallen General. Jacoby loosens his collar. Bobby
stands just behind them.

Evelyn drops the gun. And in a voice totally devoid of emotion, begins to recite the story
