FADE IN:
1. INT. BEN HORNE'S OFFICE, GREAT NORTHERN - DAY
BOBBY BRIGGS, pumped for action, marches in the door wearing Leo's suit. BEN HORNE
with his back to Bobby doesn't seem to know he's there, is pushing furniture around the room.
BOBBY
Mr. Horne? ... Mr. Horne?
Bobby studies the furniture arrangement; most of it is stacked up against one wall. He looks at
Horne; unshaven and in a bathrobe. Ben spins around to stare at him.
BOBBY
Your secretary said to come in. Bobby Briggs.
BEN
Do you know what you have to have in this life, Bobby?
Balance. Distance. Symmetry. Look.
(gestures towards the furniture)
Isn't that a beautiful thing?
BOBBY
Mr. Horne. Did you listen to the tape?
BEN
I listened to your tape Bobby. Frankly, I'm surprised
that Leo could master the technology, but ...
(a sinking spell)
Damn it, talk to me, Bobby.
BOBBY
Mr. Horne, I have a great admiration for you.
BEN
Admiration is for poets and dairy cows.
BOBBY
(a beat)
Sir, you called and asked to see me.
BEN
(moving towards him)
You're standing in front of a mammoth skyscraper. A
leviathan that rips the clouds open. What's the first
question that comes to your mind?
BOBBY
Pardon?

BEN
The first thing you ask is "What's on the top floor?"
"Who's up in that penthouse, and why?" That's what I'm
like. Are you?.
BOBBY
(doesn't have a clue)
Of course I am.
BEN
(hands him a camera and acessories)
Opportunity knocks, Bobby. Follow Hank Jennings.
Chronicle his existence. Show me something I don't
already know.
BOBBY
Uh ... how much do I get for this.
BEN
What are you making now?
BOBBY
I'm in high school.
Ben takes out a roll of bills, peels off a single bill and hands it to Bobby.
BEN
Congratulations. A 100% raise.
CUT TO:
2. INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE BEN'S OFFICE - DAY
Bobby exits into the corridor. He is stopped by a SCREAM behind him that starts far away
and moves towards him. A drop dead blonde, LANA BUDDING MILFORD, draped in her
bridal nightgown, rushes by him. Bobby smiles helplessly slowly closing the door on the strap of
the camera case. The Bride resumes her scream going around the corner. Bobby starts to
follow only to be yanked back by the strap caught in the door.

3. INT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE, CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
COOPER and a realtor, IRENE LITTLEHORSE, an American Indian in her mid-fifties,
look at a book with photographs of her listings.
LITTLEHORSE
Mr. Cooper, are you looking to rent or would you
consider leasing with an option to buy?
COOPER
I'm looking for a little piece of paradise. Upon finding
it, I'll consider any option.

LITTLEHORSE
This just came on the market; it's a Victorian, 1890's. I
can also recommend the old Longacre house.
COOPER
I'd like to see them both.
LITTLEHORSE
Very good. Which would you like to see first?
Cooper smiles. Takes a coin from his pocket. Flips it onto the table. It rolls and stops on a
picture of yet another property.
COOPER
What is this?
LITTLEHORSE
I thought I'd take that out. This property is called
"Dead Dog Farm." And it's worse than it sounds.
COOPER
(intuitive interest)
"Dead Dog Farm." What is it?
LITTLEHORSE
A puzzle. No one ever stays there long Dreamer after
dreamer has worked that patch of land.
COOPER
"A parcel of vain strivings tied by a chance bond
together."
Littlehorse smiles at Cooper.
LITTLEHORSE
I read Thoreau myself, Mr. Cooper. I have to warn you,
this isn't exactly Walden Pond.
COOPER
When can I see it?

4. INT. SHERIFF TRUMAN'S OFFICE - DAY
COLONEL CALVIN REILLY, black, sixty, made of brick sits across from Truman.
REILLY
Sheriff, what do you know about Major Briggs work?

4. CONTINUED:
TRUMAN
Well, I guess all I know is he's doing something top
secret.
Cooper sticks his head in the door.
COOPER
Harry?
TRUMAN
Cooper, this is Colonel Reilly. He's heading up the Air
Force's investigation into Briggs' disappearance.
REILLY
Cooper. Just about to hunt you down. You were with
Briggs when we lost his coordinates.
COOPER
Correct.
Reilly drops a map on Truman's desk. Points to a circled location.
REILLY
The area where he disappeared. Now when you were at
the site, did you happen to see any wildlife in the area?
COOPER
Wildlife?
REILLY
Squirrels, skunks, ground hogs.
COOPER
No ...
REILLY
Any birds? ... Owls.
COOPER
Moments before the Major disappeared I heard an owl.
REILLY
(not giving away a thing)
No visual contact?
TRUMAN
Look, Colonel, Garland Briggs is a good friend of mine
and this has us more than a little spooked. I really wish
you'd just level with us.

4. CONTINUED:(2)
REILLY
Can you clarify that?
COOPER
(a look at Truman)
We know about your monitors and the messages you
received from deep space that pertain to me.
REILLY
You may know something but you'd best get your facts
straight: our "monitors" are pointed at deep space, but
the messages we intercepted that Briggs showed you
were sent from right here in these woods. Where they
were being sent to is another question.
He points to the map again, near the disappearance site. A stunned moment as this sinks in.
COOPER
Colonel, does this have anything to do with a place
called the White Lodge?
REILLY
(taken aback)
That's classified.
TRUMAN
(pause, a look at Cooper)
Look, Colonel, we'd like to help you but you're not
making it any easier.
REILLY
(pause)
Garland Briggs is the best pilot I've ever known. He was
born with hardware most of us only dream of having.
He's been walking point on this operation for three years,
carrying a full pack. I'll tell you this: his disappearance
has implications that go so far beyond national security
the cold war seems like a case of the sniffles.

SWAIN
As I was about to tell your friends, the number one thing
to know about Nicky is that throughout his brief life he
has been confused, and perhaps traumatized, by a
persistent random misfortune.
TREYMAYNE
(noticing the size of Nicky's files)
Looks like he's bounced around quite a bit.
LUCY
The poor child.
SWAIN
Yes. An orphan, you know.
ANDY
Really? What happened? Did his parents die?
TREMAYNE
Nicely deduced, Andrew. Persistent random
misfortune.
SWAIN
They were killed.
TREMYANE
(a look at Andy)
How were they killed, Miss Swain?
SWAIN
Mysterious circumstances. I'm afraid the orphanage has
never provided us with that information.
Sheriff Truman hustles out of his office to announce ...
TRUMAN
Andy, let's go. We've got an emergency at the Great
Northern.

6. INT. MARSH HOUSE, JAMES' ROOM - DAY
JAMES sits on his bed cleaning some of his tools. He is interrupted by MALCOLM, Evelyn
Marsh's brother, carrying a large cocktail. Uniformed. Thirties. Tipsy. Oddly vulnerable.

JAMES
Can I help you?
MALCOLM
I'm heading up the local serf rebellion. Wondering if
you'd help me bundle up loose sticks to burn the master.
Malcolm. Malcom Sloan.
(shaking his hand)
As in "Brother to Evelyn." I'm Mr. Marsh's driver ... as
in "Bring the car around, James."
(takes a belt from his drink)
I spend a lot of time waiting at airports, happily
basking in the glow of cocktail lounge flourescents.
(sits across from James)
How badly did she damage the Jag?
JAMES
It's repairable.
MALCOLM
That's the nice thing about things. When she and Jeffrey
fell In love, he gave her a new life. I got a nice uniform
and the keys to the liquor cabinet.
(another drink)
Hope I don't sound ungrateful. Compared to the life I
was living wanton dissipation is a step up - and Evelyn,
well, she's learned a lot herself. Defensive postures.
Masking bruises. Vicious cycles.
JAMES
What are you talking about?
MALCOLM
I'm sorry, am I being obscure? Once a fortnight, Jeffrey
pounds her mercilessly and she tries to get even by
breaking one of his things, which perpetuates the cycle.
JAMES
She's your sister, why don't you stop him?
MALCOLM
Sonny boy, nobody stops Mr. Marsh. That's the golden
rule around here. Jot it down and put it under your
pillow.
(finishes his drink, almost tears)
No one can do anything.

7. INT. HOTEL ROOM, GREAT NORTHERN - DAY
The corpse of DOUGIE MILFORD lies in the bed. A frozen grin is plastered on his face as
DOC HAYWARD finishes a cursory exam and pulls a sheet over his head.
DOC
Looks like a heart attack.
Andy and Truman stand by. Dougie's dead hand clasping an open book falls out from below
the sheet. Andy leans over and reads.
ANDY
"Once stimulated the female will respond in such a way
that the skin around the ..." oh my God ...
TRUMAN
Guess Dougie went out with his boots on.
DOC
(gently takes the book from Andy)
"My Secret Life."
TRUMAN
I'll say ...
(inspects other books on the nightstand)
"Kama Sutra," "Collected Poems of Byron," "Hookers
and Handmaidens."
Andy discovers an ornate, purple wooden BOX on a luggage stand.
ANDY
Sheriff? Look at this.
The three gather around it and slowly, silently take out it's contents: two red clown noses,
monk's robe and cowl, large rubber bands, lotions, an eggbeater, and, finally, a lifelike mask
that bears an eerie resemblance to Gary Crosby. They stand there in awe of this discovery
until their focus is broken by shouting at the door. Mayor DWAYNE MILFORD, Dougie's
brother, walks into the room swelling with emotion.
DWAYNE
What a falling off was here ... Dougie. Lord, I hate to
say I told you so.
(sees and grabs the copy of Kama Sutra)
Here it is, Sheriff. The murder weapon. She might as
well have blown his brains out with a rifle. He never
could say no to a woman ... the old fool.
He begins to weep. Truman gestures to Andy who gently leads the Mayor to the door. Andy
opens the door and hands the mayor over to two DEPUTIES standing outside.

8. INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE THE ROOM - DAY
As the deputies take Dwayne out he spots Lana, giving her statement to Hawk.
DWAYNE
You sexual Howitzer. You'll burn in hell for this.
HAWK
Take it easy, Mr. Milford -
DWAYNE
I'm going to shout to wake the dead! She murdered my
brother, she's a witch!
He makes a pathetic attempt to get to her, forcing the deputies to lead him away. Lana begins
to weep. Hawk tries to comfort her.
LANA
He's right. I'm cursed.
HAWK
Don't be silly.
LANA
No, it's true. It started in high school. Prom night.
My date went to kiss me ... it was his first day with
braces. They gleamed in the moonlight ... and his jaw
locked open.
(barely holding on)
We ended up in the emergency room. The doctors had
to break his jaw in three places to get it to shut. It's
gotten worse ever since.
HAWK
(taking a chair beside her)
A curse needs a cure. I know a bit about these things.
BRIDE
Are you the sheriff?
Hawk idly leans his chair back against the door to Dougie's room. Puffing up.
HAWK
Let's just say that when something big goes down, I just
happen to be the man who's -
Andy opens the door behind him. Hawk goes over. On his back he looks up to see Andy
beaming stupidly at the bride, caught in her spell, as he steps on Hawk's hand.

9. INT. HIGH SCHOOL GYM - DAY
Wrestling coach, BUCK WINGATE, lectures his assembled squad who stare at NADINE
HURLEY and MIKE NELSON standing next to one another in wrestling gear on the mat.
WINGATE
Boys, there's a story about a great football coach whose
name escapes me at the time who was dead set against
having black players on his team until the day they
brought him the most fantastic black halfback anyone
had ever seen. When what's his name watched him run
fifty yards and no one laid a hand on him, he shouted,
"Look at that Indian go!"
(slaps an arm around Nadine)
That coach accepted that athlete's desire to compete.
Today that same story applies to this woman's ... young
girl's right to compete as well. In addition to which,
it's her moral and constitutional right.
(now puts his arm around Mike)
Nadine has asked to prove herself to us by wrestling the
very best: our very own District champion, Mike Nelson
(he turns Nadine and Mike toward each other)
Ready to wrestle at the sound of the whistle ...
Wingate blows his whistle. Nadine and Mike circle each other looking for the take down.
Hesitatingly, Mike makes a move for Nadine's legs, she takes him by the shoulders and lifts
him above her head. She carries on a conversation only she and Mike can hear.
NADINE
Hi, Mike.
MIKE
What are you doing?
Mike looks down at Nadine helplessly. She lowers him to the mat. Whispering to him.
NADINE
Isn't it fun we get to be so close in public?
MIKE
(struggling for air)
Neck ... you're breaking my -
NADINE
You're right. This is almost like necking.
With great effort Mike escapes, but after her quick move he is in Nadine's bear hug.

(brings him down again, his face into the matt)
Want to go do something tonight? I don't have a curfew
... hint, hint.
The rest of the team is yelling: "Pin ... Pin ..." Mike lets out a groan. To Nadine it is an
answer she can't hear. She flips him over to his back.
NADINE
What'd you say Mike?
MIKE
(fearing for his life)
Yes. Yes.
He's pinned. Coach Wingate holds up Nadine's arm.
WINGATE
Welcome aboard, Nadine Too bad you're a senior.
Nadine beams at Mike who returns her look with terror.

10. EXT. DEAD DOG
Cooper and Littlehorse stare at the house on Dead Dog Farms. An abandoned building on a
derelict farm. FADED SHUTTERS guard the window.
LITTLEHORSE
Still standing almost by force of habit.
COOPER
Habit can provide a strong foundation. Why is it called
Dead Dog Farm?
LITTLEHORSE
An old legend. Of all the people in the world the worst
and the best are drawn to a dead dog.
(off Cooper curious look)
Most turn away; those with the purest of hearts feel its
pain. Somewhere in between the rest of us struggle.
Cooper nods, walks up the muddy driveway. He stops when he sees TIRE TRACKS.
COOPER
Have you showed the property to anyone else recently?

Cooper walks in the tracks; first one, then another, and another. Almost walking in circles.
COOPER
Three cars. One a jeep, one a four-wheeler. Third's a
domestic sedan ... boot prints.
Cooper follows them towards the door. Irene follows.
CUT TO:
11. INT. KITCHEN, DEAD DOG FARM HOUSE - DAY
Littlehorse follows Cooper into the room. The place is a mess with the exception of a table
and chairs set upright. Cooper sits in a chair and then sits in one opposite it, studies the angles.
Examines some ashes on the floor.
LITTLEHORSE
What are you seeing?
COOPER
There's been a meeting here. Within the last few hours.
He hunts around for something else. Sticks his hand into the drain in the sink.
COOPER
They forgot there was no running water.
(brings out a bit of fine white powder; holds it
to the realtor's nose)
Smell anything?
LITTLEHORSE
No.
COOPER
Baby laxative.
Cooper lies on the floor under the table with his head flat against it. A bird's eye view. He
slides his head along the floor. Finds what he is looking for. He licks his finger, runs it along
the floor and brings it up covered with white powder. He shows it to Littlehorse.
LITTLEHORSE
More white powder.
Cooper holds the hand with the powder from the drain in the sink up to Littlehorse.
COOPER
(shows his white finger)
Cocaine. Irene, we have to notify the sheriff.

12. EXT. ROAD IN THE WOODS - DAY
Tremayne's car is pulled to the side of the road with a flat tire. Tremayne has managed to get
the car up on a jack. The lug nuts, the spare wheel, and the flat tire lie before him. He's trying
to read the jack's directions, leaning against the hood.
TREMAYNE
I don't understand this at all. I just had the car checked
at the Gas Farm and they assured me everything was in
perfect working order. This all seems so ... technical.
(his concentration is broken by a piercing blast
from the car's horn)
Please, Nicky, Uncle Dick is trying to read -
(drowned out by more blasts from the horn.
Tremayne snaps)
Get out of the car, Nicholas. Nicholas, get out of the
car! Right now, out of the car! Out of the CAR!
The horn stops. Pause. Nicky exits the car and moves sheepishly to Tremayne.
NICKY
Are you mad at me, Uncle Dick?
TREMAYNE
(back in control)
No, no, of course, not. Why should I be mad?
NICKY
I scared you, didn't I? You jumped around like a do- do
bird.
He laughs. Tremayne goes back to work. Nicky wanders away.
QUICK DISSOLVE:
ANOTHER ANGLE
Tremayne brings the tire up to put it on the axle, he leans into the wheel well. As he does this
the car slowly begins to rock off it's jack ... about to come down on Tremayne's neck and
shoulder. Tremayne realizes this just in time and pulls away. His glove is caught in the wheel
well. He watches as the fingers of the glove are torn off and crushed. A very close call. From
behind him, Nicky appears crying his eyes out.
NICKY
Uncle Dick, Uncle Dick.
He rushes into Tremayne's embrace.
TREMAYNE
I'm alright. Don't worry.
(Nicky wails)
What? What is it, Little Nicky?

As he comforts Nicky, Tremayne studies the overturned jack and the car sitting on absolutely
flat land. His smile fades.

13. INT. EVELYN'S GARAGE - DAY
James works below the Dusenberg on a sled. EVELYN MARSH moves into the room. James
sneaks a look as she walks towards the car; she wears an opened blouse and cut off jeans. She
carries a six pack of beer and limes. James slides the sled out.
EVELYN
Coffe break?
JAMES
Sounds great. Give me just a second.
James slides back under for a moment. Evelyn drifts to the window, stands in the sunlight.
EVELYN
It's so hot today. Feels like Indian summer. Can you
have Indian summer in the spring?
JAMES
I don't know why not.
She turns back, as James comes out from under the car.
EVELYN
I love the sun. Feels like it could just burn away all your
troubles. Wouldn't that be nice?
JAMES

I guess.
EVELYN
You've got troubles, don't you? Maybe someday we
should tell each other all our sad stories.

He enthusiastically slides behind the wheel of the car. Turns the key and the car's engine
ignites and purrs.
JAMES
Engine's fine. Think the axle'll be okay, too.
EVELYN
How'd you get so good at this?
JAMES
My Uncle Ed. You think I'm good you should see him.
He can fix anything.
EVELYN
Anything?
Evelyn is lost in a sad thought. James snuggles with her gloom.
JAMES
Met your brother today. We were talking. About your
situation and everything -
EVELYN
Mind your own business, James.
JAMES
A guy like me, I look at you, you've got this house, all
these things, you're young and beautiful, maybe I'm
dumb but I don't get it. Why are you so sad?
EVELYN
(a naked look at him)
Am I so easy to read?
JAMES
You afraid of something? Afraid of your husband?

scared that all you can think about is the wrong thing?

EVELYN (CONTINUED)
... I feel like he's stealing my life away.
JAMES
Why don't you leave?
EVELYN
It's ... complicated.
Evelyn clings to James. They kiss again. The tender kiss melts into passion. Only to be
interrupted by the a CAR HORN.
EVELYN
My God, it's him.
A car pulls up into the courtyard. She pulls away from him.
EVELYN (CONTINUED)
I've got to go. Don't worry about it. It's not as bad as
all that. Please don't worry about me. Promise.

A limo's parked outside. Thru the window he sees Evelyn embrace JEFFREY MARSH, a
large, middle-aged man. James can't quite see his face. Walking in front of Jeffrey, carrying
bags to the house is Malcolm. He faintly hears their voices.

Ben holds up a hand to stop his babbling. Bobby stops immediately. Ben peers long and hard

Bobby. I like you. How much am I paying, you,

Ben reaches into his wallet, extracts a new bill. Hands it to Bobby.

Consider this your first raise. Come back tomorrow

Josie goes to the kitchen. Catherine finishes her champagne, pours herself a second glass. Pete
watches Josie exit, then, quietly:
PETE
Catherine? You think maybe you're being a little hard on
her? I mean she's still part of the family and all.
CATHERINE
Peter, for your information, Josie had a hand in
Andrew's death and did everything in her power to
destroy me. She's lucky she's not swinging from a tree.
PETE
I don't believe it. Not the Josie I know ...
CATHERINE
(almost affectionate)
Oh, Pete. If gullibility was an aphrodisiac, you'd be a
Harem King.
Pete takes the latter as a compliment. Or maybe he's being sarcastic. It's hard to tell.
PETE
You're too kind.
Exasperated, Catherine finishes her second glass. Pours a third. She looks at Pete, considers
their life together. And raises her own hand into the air, getting a little tipsy.
CATHERINE
I'd like to propose a toast.
Pete hefts a glass of milk.

23. INT. COOPER'S ROOM - DAY (SUNSET)
START CLOSE on an advertisement in a newspaper personals column. Cooper's answer to
Windom Earle's opening move. ANOTHER ANGLE reveals Cooper seated on his bed,
holding the newspaper in one hand, his small tape recorder in the other.
COOPER
Diane, I am holding in my hand a nationally distributed
newspaper. Plenty of color pictures. My opening move
responding to Earle's opening move was printed per my
instructions in the Personals column ... but I've already
received his response to this ... yesterday. He
anticipated my opening move perfectly. I wonder where
he is. I wonder what he's planning.
(getting up to pace about room)
In the meantime, I have spent my first full day without
badge and gun the best way I know how: occupying both
body and spirit. Real estate, Diane what the local agent
charitably describes as a Fixer-Upper. Nonetheless, it's
the sort of where a man might build a home, raise
a family, I which in spite of my past, I still hope to do
both someday. However, as is so often the case, even this
bucolic hideway is filled with secrets. Secrets that
may be connected to my troubles with the Bureau. Not
to mention the cocaine found in my automobile.
(beat, a little sad)
Agent Hardy's deliberations will soon be completed. If
I can't adequately defend myself there is the very real
possibility of imprisonment. Other innocent men have
served there, apparently with no great detriment to the
development of their character. If I must go, I hope I
can uphold the tradition established by Doestoyevsky,
Solzhinytsen and many other great Russian authors.
Cooper pauses, sad, uncertain. He pulls the Bookhouse Boy patch out of his pocket, just holds
it for a moment. As if to consider his future. Suddenly: a knock at the door. Cooper turns off
the recorder, steps carefully to answer it. Out of habit, he reaches toward his shoulder holster,
reacts. He has no gun to protect himself. A beat. More knocking. Cooper answers and reveals
Audrey Horne holding the manila envelope last seen in her father's office.

COOPER
What will I find there?
AUDREY

A beat. Cooper takes the envelope, steps from the door. Audrey follows. Cooper removes the
photographs, produces a magnifying glass. And examines them: black and white snaps taken
at Dead Dog Farm. The weatherbeaten house, its distinctive shutters, visible in the
background. But, more importantly: Hank Jennings meeting with several men: Ernie Niles,
Jean Renault and the Mountie, Preston King.
AUDREY
I did good, didn't I?
COOPER
(looking up from pictures)
You did better than good. You may have saved my life.
AUDREY
Good. So now we're even.

They have girl agents?
DENISE

More or less.
COOPER
Audrey, would you excuse, us please? Agency business.
AUDREY
I thought you were grounded.
COOPER
Not for long. Goodnight. Thank you again.
AUDREY
Goodnight. You're welcome.
Audrey pauses. Then, quite suddenly, she raises up and kisses Cooper on the mouth. Audrey
takes a proud look at Denise, and steps out the door. A beat. Both ignoring the stolen kiss.
Cooper hands the photographs to Denise.
COOPER
I spent the late morning looking at an abandoned
property on the outskirts of town. Tire tracks indicated
recent activity. In the kitchen, I found traces of cocaine
and the baby laxitive used to step it out. These pictures
place Jean Renault, Hank Jennings, Norma Jennings'
father-in-law, and Preston King, Mountie, at the same
scene earlier today.
DENISE

old is that girl?
COOPER
I would have assumed you were no longer interested in
women.

Hey, I may be wearing a dress but I still put my panties

TRUMAN
Dwayne, it's been a long, hard day. Why don't you go

DWAYNE
Rest?! You expect me to sleep?! Not until that
murderous hussy is behind bars where she belongs. I'll

HAWK
Harry do you still have that bottle of Irish in your
office? I thought I might add a little to some warm

Lana sniffles meekly, wipes a fugitive tear from her cheek. Truman and Hayward stare with
surprise, enthralled. Andy emits a little pleading sigh. And Tremayne speaks with quiet
reverence, speaks for all of them:
