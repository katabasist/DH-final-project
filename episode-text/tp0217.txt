1. EXT. BOOKHOUSE - DAY
Establish.
2. INT. BOOKHOUSE
OPEN ON TRUMAN sitting at a table in the bookshelved alcove. Playing from the bar
area, we HEAR Muddy Waters, I Just Want to Make Love to You. Truman is sleepless and
unshaven; his thoughts also appear to be growing a little wild. Before him is a half-empty
bottle of Canadian whiskey and an overturned, unused shot glass, which Truman lazily twirls.
HAWK enters carrying a box which he places in front the sheriff. He opens the box: it's a
packed Diner breakfast. Truman looks up at Hawk indifferently.
HAWK
One of Norma's breakfasts. Made special.
TRUMAN
(pushing it aside, he takes a drink)
Maybe later.
Hawk says nothing, but his look lingers for a moment.
TRUMAN
How's things at the station?
HAWK
Earle's chess game is the big concern. Man has a poor sense
of recreation.
A brief beat. As these are his vacation days, the same could obviously be said of Truman.
HAWK
We're holding up. For now.
TRUMAN
Cooper can handle it.
(beat)
It's a pretty simple town. Used to be, anyway. Maybe
the world's just caught up to it.
And perhaps also to Truman. Hawk gives the sheriff a Bookhouse salute, and goes, his receding
bootsteps slowed by concern.

4. INT. DOUBLE R DINER - DAY
START ON an attractive YOUNG WOMAN as she enters the Double R carrying a small
suitcase. She looks about, tentative, then spots NORMA stepping into view.
YOUNG WOMAN
Norma!
NORMA
(sees her, brightens)
Annie ...
It's Norma's sister, ANNIE BLACKBURNE. Norma comes around the counter to offer a
welcoming embrace. Annie receives it with relief, some hesitation. She's got a lot on her
mind. SHELLY comes out from the kitchen, carrying an order.
NORMA
Shelly, this is my sister, Annie.
SHELLY
Welcome, Annie. Norma's told me all about you.
Shelly, with an order in hand, spins away. Annie looks at her sister.
ANNIE
(a rueful smile)
All ... about me?
NORMA
Shelly's like family.
ANNIE
With our family that's not exactly a character reference.
NORMA
(gets the idea)
How did you and mom get along?
ANNIE
We can talk about her, or we can feel good about things.
I vote for plan B.
NORMA
Me, too. I'm glad you're here.
ANNIE
Feels a little strange. The real world. Little things.
Like I'd almost forgotten how to use money. Closest
we'd get in the convent was bingo chips.
(severe)
No charity, Norma. Promise.

I'll work you 'till you drop.
CAMERA DRIFTS OVER to Shelly, who's just lowered the special in front of her customer,
MAJOR BRIGGS, and has waited a moment for him to sample.
BRIGGS
(nods)
Compelling.
Reasonably satisfied this isn't a complaint, she tentatively smiles and moves away. The LOG
LADY enters, passing behind Briggs at the counter and slowing to sit next to him. She then
suddenly stops behind the Major, staring down into his neck.
5. LOG LADY'S POV - BRIGGS
On the back of his neck, just above the high military collar, is a strange small marking,
consisting of three joined inverted triangles.
The Log Lady stares at the marking for a long beat. Then, as if touching some ancient rune,
reaches out, places two fingers upon it. Major Briggs feels her touch, swivels to face her.

6. INT. SHERIFF'S STATION - TRUMAN'S OFFICE - DAY
DALE COOPER, in full deputy dress, sits at Truman's desk, looking over several piles of
paperwork. At a corner of the desk is a copy of the Twin Peaks Gazette, opened to the
Personals section. Hawk enters.
HAWK
Harry's about to hit bottom.
COOPER
Is he eating?
(Hawk shakes his head)
His vacation days'll be used up soon. Think he'll come
back to work?
HAWK
Guess we'll find out. Give you a hand?
COOPER
That's a question I should be asking you.
HAWK
You're the senior lawman, Cooper. Let's let the rain fall
as it has been.
(eyeing the desk)
Besides. I hate paperwork.

COOPER
This is worse than the bureau, all the international
documentation. Eckhardt... Josie...
(reaches for a folder)
Have you seen Doc Hayward's autopsy on her? Says he
couldn't determine cause of death. And the body
weighed sixty-five pounds.
HAWK
How is that possible?
COOPER
I don't know. Maybe something to do with what I saw in
the room when she died.
HAWK
Maybe we'd better just whistle on our way past the
graveyard.
COOPER
Yeah.
HAWK
Anything on Earle?
COOPER
That trail's completely cold.
(grimly)
We'll have to wait for his response.

7. INT. GREAT NORTHERN DINING ROOM - DAY
Hectic preparations for tonight's fashion show benefit for Stop Ghostwood. Amidst the
workers still building the runway, AUDREY HORNE rehearses and directs the models.
RICHARD TREMAYNE, the peacockish host, is accomplishing nothing outside of a skillful
job of smoking. He sidles up to a couple idle MODELS, who stand in requisite boredom,
awaiting further instructions, or romantic rescue.
TREMAYNE
Ladies, may I say you'll both delightfully represent the
sanctity of nature.
(the models just look at him)
Cigarette?
MODEL
I like to keep my chest clear.

Audrey comes up to Tremayne, irritated by his utter uselessness.
AUDREY
Have you spoken with Pinkle?
TREMAYNE
What's a Pinkle?
AUDREY
He's going to give a talk on the Pine Weasel.
(blank)
The endangered animal.
TREMAYNE
Oh. Lovely. What is it? A raccoon or something?
AUDREY
A ferret.
(looking out)
There he is.
TIM PINKLE, of Tim and Tom's Taxidermy approaches, carrying a large stuffed Pine
Weasel under one arm. His plaid jacket looks almost like a taxidermy that didn't take.
AUDREY
You two should coordinate.
TREMAYNE
You are dreaming.
Audrey turns away and runs straight into JOHN JUSTICE WHEELER. She is momentarily,
uncharacteristically, schoolgirlishly flustered.
WHEELER
Hello, Audrey.
(gazing about)
You look like you're trying to run lumber upstream.
AUDREY
(seeking safer terrain)
How may I help you, Mr. Wheeler?
WHEELER
Well, I was thinking about our talk last night...

AUDREY
Oh gosh, I'm sorry, I was rude, wasn't I? It's just that
when it comes to family, I...
WHEELER
My fault entirely.
Audrey and Wheeler drift closer, casting sentences at each other.
AUDREY
...get a little excitable, that's all.
WHEELER
Who am I to waltz in here out of nowhere...
AUDREY
We need help, anyone can see that...
WHEELER
... as if your father didn't have enough help already....
AUDREY
... and I can't think of anyone better qualified for the job
than you...
Suddenly, Wheeler stops, removes himself from the back and forth. Audrey takes note, looks
up at him. Wheeler smiles.
WHEELER
Hello.
AUDREY
(a little dreamy)
What're we talking about anyway?
WHEELER
I was apologizing. You were apologizing. We're both
real sorry...
(new idea)
Do you ... want to go somewhere...?
(eying the pandemonium around them)
... this is probably not a good time...
AUDREY
Oh, no, it's great.

WHEELER
How about a picnic?
AUDREY
Well, we'll need outdoors stuff. A blanket, a basket...
WHEELER
Food.
AUDREY
I don't know how to cook.
WHEELER
I'll bet there's someone in the kitchen who does.
CAMERA PICKS UP Tremayne and Pinkle, passing by.
PINKLE
(proferring the stuffed animal)
It's just so people can see what a Pine Weasel looks like.
TRUMAN
I understand the concept perfectly, Mr. Twinkle.
PINKLE
Pinkle. The name is Pinkle.
TREMAYNE
But what I'm trying to make clear to you is that using a
stuffed animal to represent an endangered species at an
ecological protest constitutes the supreme incongruity.
PINKLE
Yeah, that's real clear, Dick...

8. INT. WINDOM EARLE'S CABIN - DAY
OPEN ON a work desk on which sit three stainless steel suitcases. One of them, a makeup
case, is open. Propped against its standing half is the photograph of a bearded, bespectacled
young man with white bushy eyebrows. SOUND of an irregular wheeze of breathing: PAN
ACROSS THE ROOM to where LEO JOHNSON awkwardly reaches down into a closet,
emerging with... Windom Earle's slippers. One in each hand. He shuffles into the living room,
up to the easy chair where Windom sits.
LEO
Slip...
WINDOM
Slippers.

Earle's tone makes Leo look up suddenly, anticipating a shock. But none is coming. SHOT
CLOSES ON Earle as we hear Leo moving away.
EARLE
You know Leo, you really can't appreciate how tonic
country life is until you're actually right here living it.
A concurring GRUNT from OFF SCREEN. Leo approaches again, carrying Earle's pipe.
LEO
Pipe...
EARLE
Splendid.
(takes the pipe; Leo goes)
Even if you've been in the country before, when you
imagine what it would be like to go back... the image is
imperfect. The mental image is always imperfect. Am
I right?
Leo arrives again with the day's paper, flinching at Earle's look.
EARLE (CONT'D)
Tacit agreement is acceptable, Leo. Your silence speaks
volumes.
(takes the paper and opens it)
Or if not volumes at least the occasional, unpunctuated
paragraph.
Leo sits on a small crate purposely positioned at Earle's right hand. Leo's spot.
EARLE (CONT'D)
Let's see what move our poor Cooper's come up with this
time...
After finding the chess move, Earle's eyes stay on the page a beat. He then leans over to the
chess board on his other side and makes the communicated move. A long survey of the board.
Looks up with great displeasure. Leo gazes at him as we might an overcast sky.
EARLE (CONT'D)
This isn't a move. This is a trick.
(gazing at Leo)
He's playing a stalemate game.
(Leo's confused return stare)
Cooper doesn't know the meaning of stalemate...
(cool fury)
He's getting help.
Earle reaches for his Samurai flute. Leo knows it isn't to play: this is not a musical moment.
CLOSE ON the flute, held high and swaying in the air.

8. CONTINUED:(2)
EARLE (CONT'D)
I have no tolerance for people who don't play by the rules.
People who shirk the standards.
The flute comes crashing down on Leo's head. He wimpers in discomfort.
EARLE (CONT'D)
Many people are going to regret this.
He lifts the flute again. Leo cowers. But Earle merely raises it to his mouth. And plays.
CLOSE ON a glistening emerald ring on Earle's left hand. THEN PULL BACK, framing
this little domestic tableau.

OPEN ON Truman, looking pretty much as before. His breakfast hasn't been touched. His
whiskey has. He continues to fiddle with the empty shot glass. Cooper enters, taking in the
whole scene with a glance; he sits down across from Truman.
TRUMAN
Coop.
COOPER
Harry.
(sits)
We got Josie's dossier in from INTERPOL.
TRUMAN
More good news.
COOPER
In addition to her killing Eckhardt, trying to kill me and
killing Jonathan in Seattle...
TRUMAN
Closed cases.
COOPER
She's also been a wanted for a variety of felonies in Hong
Kong.
TRUMAN
I don't need to hear this.
COOPER
She also had two prostitution arrests...
Truman turns away in despair.
COOPER
Harry, eventually it'll help for you to know she was a
hardened criminal. A killer.
TRUMAN
Get out.
COOPER
I know it's not easy now -

10. INT. BLUE PINE LODGE
CATHERINE sits at her desk, pores over blueprints and documents. Plans for the new and
improved Ghostwood development. She hears a faint rustling sound, looks up ... and sees
JONES standing across the room.
JONES
The door was open.
CATHERINE
(cool and calm)
A country habit. We're all so trusting.
JONES
My name is Jones, I was exec executive assistant to the late Mr.
Eckhardt.
Catherine gestures to a chair, carefully watches her guest take a seat. Jones has a satchel purse,
which Catherine is also watching.
JONES
Thank you. I've come to expedite the transport of his
body back to Hong Kong.
(Catherine says nothing: what does this woman
want?)
Tragic, what happened. You know, he really did love
Josie.
CATHERINE
(inimitably)
Didn't we all.
JONES
They're going to be buried side by side...
CATHERINE
So they can keep an eye on each other.
JONES
I guess you have your reasons to be bitter.

CATHERINE
Call me a healthy skeptic.
Catherine raises her hand above the desk, reveals the gun she's been holding since she discovered
Jones in her living room.
CATHERINE
Now, what did you really come here to see me about?
JONES
I came here to give you a gift.
(motioning to her purse)
May I?
CATHERINE
I don't think so.
(motioning)
Empty it.
Jones complies, emptying her large purse onto the couch beside her. Out fall no guns or
weapons of any kind, just women 's minutiae, save one very mysterious looking black box.
Jones picks it up and hands it to Catherine.
JONES
From Thomas.
Catherine gazes at it, puzzled. Jones scoops her belongings back into the purse and rises to her
feet, Catherine lowers the gun barrel.
JONES
I have a few things to tidy up, then I'll be leaving tonight.
(warmly)
Good luck, Mrs. Martell.
We HEAR her going as the SHOT CLOSES on the black gift box.

11. INT. HAYWARD HOUSE
Donna sits in the front room over a cup of coffee and a copy of the Gazette. The DOORBELL
sounds. At the door is a vaguely familiar man with a close light beard, spectacles and thick,
snowy eyebrows. We RECOGNIZE his face from the photograph in Earle's cabin.
MAN
Excuse me. I'm looking for Bill or Eileen Hayward.
DONNA
They're not in. Can I help you?

#2.017 13.
11. CONTINUED:
MAN
I'm Dr. Gerald Craig, a friend of Will's from medical
school. I've got a convention over in Spokane, and I
thought I'd swing by and surprise them. Now, which
daughter are you?
DONNA
I'm Donna.
(pause)
Would you like to come in, Dr. Craig?
CRAIG
I'd appreciate that.
They enter the living room, toward the perpendicularity of couch and chair.
DONNA
Would you like some coffee?
CRAIG
Thank you, no.
(sits, sees the Gazette)
Is this your local paper?
DONNA
Yes. It's a pretty small town.
Craig is stealing a glance at her, and various details of the room.
CRAIG
Don't knock small towns, till you've lived in a city
Donna. Looks to me like Will's found himself a little
piece of heaven here.
(beat)
Now, don't you have two sisters?
DONNA
Yes. They're younger.
CRAIG
(simply)
Are they both as beautiful as you?
DONNA
Well I don't really -
CRAIG
Funny. Your dad and I used to sit around, try to figure
how our lives would turn out. Think he came closer to the
mark than I have.

11. CONTINUED:(2)
CRAIG (continued)
(self-deprecating laugh)
You're in high school?
DONNA
Unfortunately.
CRAIG
I felt exactly the same way. High school's difficult; you
have no idea what you want to do with your life, so it
seems as if almost none of it applies to your life.
DONNA
(impressed)
That's right.
CRAIG
Trust me, it'll make sense later. For now, just enjoy it.
In all its absurdity.
Donna is visibly refreshed to hear so something from an adult that sounds so life-accurate.
CRAIG
I have a small gift for your dad. Can I trust you not to
open it?
DONNA
(intrigued)
Sure.
Craig pulls a small, wrapped box from his pocket.
CRAIG
Speaking of school. Will and I graduated thirty years
ago, this month. This is a small remembrance for him.
He hands it to her. With the box is a piece of paper.
CRAIG
(re the paper)
I should be on my way. That's the number where I'm
staying.
(stands)
Hope to see you later, Donna.
DONNA
Me, too.
She looks at this little package with fascination. As he ambles off, we HEAR Craig begin to
whistle: we RECOGNIZE this as the piece Earle was playing on his Samurai flute.

12. INT. SHERIFF'S STATION - DAY
Encamped in one growing corner of the room is PETE MARTELL, surrounded by chess
boards, chess books, coffee, lined tablets on which he's made notations specific enough to
embarrass some field generals of actual wars. Cooper enters.
COOPER
Pete, how are we doing?
Martell looks up. Another face in need of sleep.
PETE
Never had to look at a chess board like it's a bunch of
actual human beings. Makes for some nasty dreams.
(beat)
I've been through every stalemate in recorded history, and
I've jerryrigged a few country standoffs they've written no
books about. But it's no use: there isn't a stalemate game
on earth where you don't lose at least a few footsoldiers.
(sighs)
The classic Herbstman leaves you with six pieces. Now I
can improve on that, but even if I get there in half the
time and keep twelve, that means six people will die.
COOPER
Do your best, Pete. Windom Earle's genius carries with it
the vice of impatientence. He doesn't want to kill eight
pawns. He wants royalty. Protect those, particularly the
queen, and we can frustrate him.
WOMAN (O.S.)
You can't do that.
PETE
(to Cooper)
My students.
In another corner of the room, LUCY and ANDY sit across a chess board, clearly at
loggerheads.
LUCY
Mr. Martell, Andy moved his knight but he didn't do the
little hook thing.
ANDY
You don't have to do the little hook thing. That's
optional.
PETE
Andy ... the knight has to do the little hook thing.

PETE
It's a privilege. No one else gets to make that move.

Lucy looks on at her opponent with indignant superiority.
LUCY
I guess some people don't know quite as much as they
think they do...

Check.
Brennan stares at the board. Cooper turns to see he has visitors.
BRIGG'S VOICE
We thought it best we come see you.

13. INT. CONFERENCE ROOM
ANGLE ON the blackboard, on which are drawn three inverted triangles. PULL BACK to
Cooper, Briggs and the Log Lady.
BRIGGS
As you know, that pattern on the back of my neck
appeared during ... my experience. With of course no
idea as to how it got there.
COOPER
(to the Log Lady)
And you noticed it today.
LOG LADY
My log noticed. I remember.

Remember?

LOG LADY (V.O.)
I was seven years old. I went walking up in the woods
and when I got back, I was told I'd disappeared for a
day. All I could recall was a flash of light ... and that
mark was on my leg.
BACK TO SCENE
BRIGGS
We all three recall the light.
LOG LADY
And also... the sound of an owl...
COOPER
I remember that.
LOG LADY
The only other other time I saw that sight and heard that
sound... was just before my husband died.
Cooper is staring at the board. He steps up to the square of four triangles and draws Briggs's
three smaller inverted triangles inside them creating another shape which immediately
excites Briggs and the Log Lady.
BRIGGS
I've seen that before.
LOG LADY
Yes...
Cooper turns to them excitedly.
COOPER
What is it?
Something about this figure is visibly upsetting to them both. Briggs looks at Cooper and just
shakes his head. The Log Lady hunkers down with her log, for security and insight, and finally
looks up, dismayed.
LOG LADY
I don't know...

OPEN ON a wooded vista, some hidden spot in the verdent forest. We HEAR a man's voice,
singing clear as a bell, 0 Bury Me Not On The Lone Prairie. CAMERA MOVES between the
pines to REVEAL Audrey and John Wheeler seated upon a blanket, a picnic lunch between
them, Wheeler singing his cowboy song. Audrey watches, jawdropped, she couldn't be more
surprised ... or taken with this handsome stranger. Wheeler finishes, peers at her. For once in her
life Audrey Horne is speechless. Finally:
AUDREY
Wow.
Wheeler says nothing, waits for her. Audrey, suddenly vulnerable, without the usual banter to
protect her, finally continues:
AUDREY
Nobody's ever sung a song to me before.
WHEELER
You must've been serenaded a time or two.
AUDREY (not coy)
I don't inspire a lot of singing. Most boys are afraid.
Wolf whistles, maybe.
WHEELER
(appreciating the revelation)
They don't know you then. Not really.
He's right. Audrey's been waiting a long time for someone to discover her secrets. She's
delighted, though not sure what to say. Wheeler interprets her silence as rebuke.
WHEELER
Sorry for being forward. It's not I like I know you that
well. In fact I don't know you at all.
(to self as well as Audrey)
Charm is a rocky road...
(quiet humor)
Another cowboy song, I know, a shot...?
AUDREY
(with an affectionate smile)
I'm completely tone deaf.
Now it's his turn to be discomfited. A beat. Both realizing that the other fills them with a
sort of uncertain warmth, the awkwardness that accompanies sudden infatuation, or love.
Wheeler reaches for a bottle of beer, changes the subject.

Frozen color.
Wheeler looks at her. Audrey pauses, preoccupied; then returns to the heart of the matter.
AUDREY
I don't think anyone really knows me.
WHEELER
That sounds like a warning.
AUDREY
(faint hesitation)
I know.
WHEELER
(considerate as always)
Audrey. If there's some other guy, I'll...
AUDREY
There used to be, but...
A long beat. Audrey thinking about Cooper, first love, then, at last...
AUDREY (warm and certain)
No. There's not. There's nobody.
WHEELER
So what'll we do now?
AUDREY (with humor)
Know any more cowboy tricks?
WHEELER (in kind)
If you've got a lariat in that picnic basket, I could lasso
passing cattle.
AUDREY
The closest cow is miles from here.
WHEELER
Well. Stray dogs, raccoons, a bluebird ... anything you

Craig?
Hayward reacts with visible surprise. Eileen pales.

He left a phone number. And this.
Donna hands her father the wrapped package , Craig's phone number. Hayward, still silent,

Fearing this might again be the impostor, Donna starts down the stairs, but only gets a couple
beats down...

It's so cute the way you get embarrassed.
Ed gathers himself. This is not easy. Despite the absurdity of it, this is still, after all, his
wife; and someone he's been with since high school.
ED
And since I've found someone else ... Nadine, I'm not sure
you're going to understand this.
NADINE
Course I understand, Eddie. This isn't just a little spat.
JACOBY
Do you know what Ed is suggesting?
NADINE
It's not too obvious. We're not like talking relativity
here. We're breaking up. Major, final breakup.
Ed and Jacoby trade looks.
JACOBY
Well, yes, technically it is a breakup, Nadine...
ED
But it's a little more than that, too, honey.
NADINE
Ed, you're so serious. These are the dating years. You're
acting like it's some really big deal.
ED
(pause, aside)
Doc ...
JACOBY
(stage whisper)
There aren't any secret tricks or magic words. It's like
the dissolving of scar tissue around a wound: she'll start
to see reality again when her mind begins to feel safe.
ED
When will that be?

Okay, well one thing I don't want to see, Ed, are any
incidents with Mike. No jealous rages.

Well... maybe just a little one.
ED
I give up.
JACOBY
Nadine. You and Ed are about to get a divorce.
Nadine stares at Jacoby. Her expression goes from incomprehension to discomfort to fear.
Suddenly she closes her good right eye. Opens it.
NADINE
I think I've gone blind in my left eye.
It's the eye with the patch. Ed and Jacoby again trade looks, they are both bankrupt of

NORMA (deadpan)
You're a shoe-in.
SHELLY (in kind)
I've got an order up.
Shelly, to Norma's amusement, sashays to the kitchen window and vamps the order over to her
customer, a dark-haired man who looks like a highway gypsy, possibly a trucker.
MAN
What's with the little dance?
SHELLY
Oh, my boss was telling me I should enter this contest.
(self-deprecating scoff)
Miss Twin Peaks.
As she lowers his order, we see the EMERALD RING of Windom Earle.
MAN (EARLE)
You can kid about it, but you're very pretty. I think you
should enter.
SHELLY
Thank you. I never think of myself as pretty.
Shelly muses as she walks away. Over her shoulder we watch Cooper enter and take a counter
seat on the side opposite Earle, and further down. We CLOSE ON Cooper.
ANNIE (O.S.)
Are you ready to order?
He looks up at this unfamiliar voice and freezes on Annie Blackburne's face. There is instant,
mutual attraction. Something close to love at first sight. Cooper is hooked by Annie's soft
features - Botticcelli's Venus serving coffee. Annie feels it too, but is far less comfortable with
it.
COOPER
A cup of deep, black joe.

Are you staying in town ... awhile?
ANNIE
I might be here quite a while
COOPER
It's happened to me.
ANNIE
Looks like it's grown on you.

She starts to speak, then self-consciously backs off, sloe-eyed, half-smiling.

stares over at Cooper speaking to Annie. Studying him.
BACK TO SCENE
As Annie serves his coffee, her longsleeved shirt rides up far enough for Cooper to spot the
beginning of extensive wrist scars. He knows what they mean.
ANNIE
I made it a little strong.

You made it right.
Cooper gets an odd feeling, and suddenly looks across the counter: Earle is gone. Hawk
enters, making a straight line for Coop.

Agent Cooper, Hawk, the Sheriff's gone off. He's broken
every piece of furniture that's not nailed down and shot
out the ceiling lights. I honestly don't know what to do.
HAWK
It's okay, Andy.
He is clearly frightened. Cooper and Hawk follow a trail of broken furniture. Truman sits in
darkness, a bottle of Jack Daniels beside him, gun in hand.
TRUMAN
Hello, Coop. How's business?
COOPER
A little complicated at the moment.
TRUMAN
Nice thing about the law. It doesn't breathe.

You can't kill it.
COOPER
Harry, let's make this simple ... why don't you hand me
that gun.
TRUMAN
Don't think I've handed my gun over to anybody my
entire life.
COOPER
This might be the time.
TRUMAN
You know something else I've never done? I've never

I know she lied. I know she was evil.

I looked into her eyes... and watched the life drain out of

With that, Truman completely unravels, knocking over the bottle.
TRUMAN
It didn't have to end like that... she didn't have to die...
The gun's aim swings into wider, more dangerous circles. Cooper steps in, pulls Truman into
a bearhug. Truman grabs onto him, finally allowing himself some comfort.
COOPER
Easy.
The sheriff's arms extend despondently, the gun dangling from his hand. Hawk takes it.
TRUMAN
There's so much I don't understand...

Never seen him that way. It was like hiking out to a

Only until tomorrow. If that's okay. We're going deep

Oh goody.
MIKE
Okay, so we'll just go now. Me and Mrs. Hinkman.
Two of the Ghostwood benefit models pass by. Young girls, about high school age. One of
them slows at the sight of the registering couple.
MODEL
Is that ... Mike?
Mike cringes. Nadine, through shades and an eye patch, stares knives at this girl, who is
thinking her buddy Mike must have lost a bet.
MIKE
How are you, Susan?
MODEL
Fine.

See you in school...
Lazare looks askance at this. Nadine simmers. Mike feels her iron grip tighten further.

For emphasis, Nadine impatiently SLAMS the desk bell. The clerk stares down at the
counter. The bell is flattened. Mike smiles weakly, lifting the empty suitcase.

25. INT. GREAT NORTHERN DINING ROOM
The Stop Ghostwood benefit has drawn a large, black tie crowd. BEN HORNE stands at the
microphone, located off on a wing of the newly constructed runway.
BEN
I'd first like to thank you all for this marvelous turnout.
It's gratifying to see so many people who are serious
about their environment.
(beat)
The Stop Ghostwood campaign is a determined effort to
keep the rabid development interests from trying to turn
our beautiful northwest forests into a monstrous
amusement park, destroying animal preserves that have
been undisturbed for centuries, the little worlds which
serve as sanctums for several endangered species.
Before moving along, I'd just like to remind us all that
ecology is not a luxury science, and it's not about pleasant
appearances: it's about survival. About whether we're all
going to make it. Period.
(beat)
But on the other hand, not to understate the value of visual
splendor, we come now to our fashion show. If you think
you recognize some of our models, it's because they're
concerned members of our community who have
graciously contributed their time tonight. So, ladies and
gentlemen, to kick things off, our host Richard
Tremayne.
Tremayne approaches the mike to scattered applause, grinning up past his eyebrows.
TREMAYNE
Thank you. Splendid gathering.
We DROP to a LONG SHOT of the runway, FAVORING the models as they emerge. The
first striding figure is Lucy Moran, cautiously eying Tremayne as she walks uncertainly out
along the ramp.
TREMAYNE
Our little Lucy wears a delightful mix of warm northern
comfort and southern insouciance. An elegant worsted
wool jacket over a sueded charmeuse T-shirt... fabulous,
isn't it?
Having nervously reached the end of the runway a little early, Lucy has to do a few too many
turns and starts to grow dizzy.
TREMAYNE
And a moonless-night-blue slim skirt of matching
worsted, for the look that always says, hey, world! I'm
here...
(CONTINUED)

Lucy wobbles back toward the curtain. A pause. The next model, who looks more like he's
walking a plank than a runway, is Andy Brennan.
TREMAYNE
Mr. Brennan, a man for all seasons, is wearing a baby rib
wool turtleneck beneath a daring plaid all-wool
pendleton shirt.
Andy reaches the end of the ramp and freezes in stage fright, gawking out at the audience.
TREMAYNE
The look is completed by his black flaring cotton
trousers. For the man who wants to make a statement
while retaining the casual feel, whether he's out mastering
a task or riding the breeze of a chance meeting ...

That'll do it, Andy.
With stiff hulklike movements, Andy turns and goes.

out of his shirt.
ANDY
I'm hot in this thing.
LUCY
You're hot? All this worsted? I'm dressed like a sheep.

And I also think Mr. Tremayne's getting a little warm

Catherine, dear, how good of you to come?
CATHERINE
Ben, darling, let me ask you; who are you kidding with all this?
BEN
Catherine, I am absolutely one hundred per cent sincere.
CATHERINE
Ben, look who you're talking to. We're in the same line of
work: you've always been a little more obvious, but this...
at least I use some imagination.
BEN
Catherine, have you ever in your entire life had an
experience that truly changed you.
CATHERINE
Spare me the Born Again sales pitch and level with me,
you can't really hope to stop development plans with
this little sideshow; what do you actually expect to gain
from all this?
BEN
A first scrubbing on one of the dirtiest consciences in the
entire Northwest.
(beat)
It'll happen to you, Catherine. I know what you're
planning with Ghostwood. And granted, I used to see
life exactly the way you do. And no matter how many
deals I closed, or much money I made, inside I was a
black, miserable clod of dirt. Catherine, the one thing
that really affords you joy in life, the only authentic
thing is giving. Darling, don't wait until you're on your
death bed to find that out.
CATHERINE
God help you. It sounds like you actually mean this.

28. RUNWAY STAGE
Standing beside Tremayne, much to Richard's disgust, is Tim Pinkle, attired in a cherry
sportcoat and pink polyester pants. Beside Pinkle is a cage, containing a meek-looking weasel.
TREMAYNE
And now, to introduce us to an endangered little critter
whose home is currently under attack by the proposed
Ghostwooddevelopment project ... Mr. Tim Pinkle.
PINKLE
Thanks, Dick. How's everybody doing tonight?
(nothing)
That's good.
In following the taller Tremayne, Pinkle loosens the stand in order to lower the mike, which
drops with a loud thud down to his ankle. In trying to extend it back up, he encounters more
resistance, gives it a good yank and shoots the mike up for someone six-eleven. Tremayne just
stares at him. Finally Pinkle lowers it to where it was originally.
PINKLE
Thank you. I'm here to introduce you all to a little guy
who doesn't understand the dark peril that awaits him.
An innocent in a world gone mad ...
Tremayne lightly elbows him, in a plea for brevity. Pinkie drops down and opens the cage.
PINKLE
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you ... the endangered Pine
Weasel.
Pinkle reaches down into the cage and pulls up the frightened animal, who is half-hypnotized
by the lights.
PINKLE
This species, technically of the weasel family, not only is
nonaggressive toward us humans and has beautiful fur ... he
is also by nature an excellent controller of rodents.
Pinkle holds the animal up in front of Tremayne.

The weasel leans over toward Tremayne, sniffing.
PINKLE

TREMAYNE
Must be my tie clasp.
PINKLE
And to various smells, particularly, believe it or not, very
cheap cologne ...
Ignoring this, Tremayne affectionately drops his head down toward the weasel, playing to the
audience. The little creature reaches up toward Tremayne.
PINKLE
Think he wants to give you a little kiss, Dick ...
TREMAYNE
(suppressing revulsion)
Hello there, little pilgrim.
The weasel lunges up sweetly and suddenly bites Tremayne on the nose. The host lets out a
yell, trying to pull himself away, but the animal won't let go. Tremayne finally wrenches
himself free, dancing up the runway in pain. The weasel screeches and bolts off the stage,
causing an immediate panic in the crowd. Women scurry around senselessly, screaming in fear.
PINKLE
No need to panic, folks ... he's completely harmless...
The place is in chaos. The weasel tears through the room, under a banquet table, spilling back
guests on both sides. Andy Brennan, still in costume, begins pursuit.
ANDY
Nobody panic!!......
Up on the stage, Audrey is out trying to restore order.
AUDREY
Please everyone, calm down... stay in your seats ...
From behind, an alarmed model knocks Audrey off the runway. She tumbles headlong ... into

They share a laugh as confused patrons knife by them. Audrey settles a little deeper into his
