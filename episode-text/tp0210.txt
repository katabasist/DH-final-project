2. INT. PALMER HOUSE - DAY
ON the Fireplace MANTLE, a still life: bouquet of FLOWERS, with LAURA'S framed
PROM QUEEN PHOTO, on one side, and in a matching frame, a PHOTO OF LELAND
on the other. CAMERA MOVES over to the sofa. SARAH PALMER sits with DOC
HAYWARD - holding her hand. She's dressed in black, and Doc's wearing a somber suit.
HAYWARD
Sarah I'd like you to take this.
COOPER sits in a chair opposite them.
SARAH
No, Doc, I don't want it. I want to be there. Every
single part of me needs to be there - for both of them.
(looks at Cooper struggling to understand)
Today I bury my husband. Next to my only child. Her
grave is still fresh. There's just a little bit of grass on it.
She stops, numb with grief. Cooper leans in.
COOPER
Mrs. Palmer, there are things dark and heinous in this
world. Things too horrible to tell our children. Your
husband fell victim to one of them. Long ago, when he
was innocent and trusting. Leland didn't commit these
crimes. Not the Leland you knew.
SARAH
(a shudder of fear)
The man I saw. That disgusting long hair.
COOPER
He's gone. Forever.
SARAH
So is everything dear to me.
COOPER
Laura and Leland have gone from this life to the next. But
they're with you always. Here ... and here ...

COOPER (continued)
The experience we have of people doesn't leave when they
do. If you close your eyes, you can see Laura blowing out
the candles on her birthday cake, Leland mowing the
yard, shaving at the sink ...
(Sarah closes her eyes)
Those moments are yours. Always.
She nods, grateful. Cooper glances at his watch.
COOPER
It's time.
She reacts - reality intrudes. Cooper rises, offering her his arm.
COOPER
Mrs. Palmer, I'd be honored to drive you.

3. INT. HAYWARD HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON
CLOSE ON the dining room table arrayed with FOOD. Plates are being filled with ham,
fried chicken, scalloped potatoes, green beans, waldorf salad, hot rolls, pecan pies, apple
cobbler, etc. There's a quiet BUZZ of CONVERSATION.
ANOTHER ANGLE reveals mourners as they gather. NADINE HURLEY stands alone,
seemingly preoccupied, waving her hands back and forth over her shoetops. HANK
JENNINGS stands at the buffet, loads up a plate of food. CAMERA FOLLOWS Hank as
he moves through the crowd.

3. ANGLE ON SOFA
MRS. PALMER sits on the sofa with AUDREY. EILEEN HAYWARD has parked her
wheelchair next to them. Hank steps into view. He leans over, sweetly handing Sarah a plate
of food.
HANK
Here you go. While it's hot.
SARAH
Thank you very much.
Hank pauses to receive her gratitude, then looks up, reacts. BIG ED HURLEY and NORMA
JENNINGS stand together across the room. Talking quietly, sharing some confidence.
Hank scowls, watches as Norma steps away. Then returns to the buffet.
AUDREY
(watching Hank walk away)
Do you invite people to these things or do they just show
up?
EILEEN
At a time like this people just naturally come together.
It is a time of reaching out. I remember when my mother
died there must have been a hundred people.
SARAH
I remember. Donna came to see Laura that night. They
promised they'd be best friends for life. A bond against
dying ...
Eileen reacts - feeling bad for bringing this up.
SARAH (CONTINUED)
No, please, I want to remember. Donna spent the night
that night. Leland said not on a school night, but I said it
was fine.
EILEEN
I remember that, too.
Eileen takes Sarah's hand, and squeezes it - two mothers loving their daughters.

DONNA (continued)
thinks it's all his fault. First Laura, then Maddy. Or
maybe he blames me, I don't know. Two people in love
couldn't cause something like this, could they?
The tears roll down her cheeks - totally bereft. Ed gets out his handkerchief.
ED
C'mon, Donna, honey. He'll come back soon.
Everything's gonna get better.
Nadine rushes over, agitated.
NADINE
Excuse me, Eddie.
(lowering her voice)
Can you see my underpants in my shoes?
Ed's completely flummoxed. He looks at her gleaming shoes.
NADINE (Cont'd)
I looked down and thought I could see the reflection. Do
you think boys have been looking up my dress?
ED
Sweetheart, I can't see a thing in your shoes. I promise.
Satisfied, Nadine returns to the coffee machine. Donna gives Ed a sympathetic look.

5A. INT. HAYWARD FOYER
COOPER stands by the staircase with Truman and DR. JACOBY. MAJOR BRIGGS joins
them.
MAJOR BRIGGS
Welcome home, Dr. Jacoby. You appear to have fully
recovered from your recent setback.
JACOBY
Nothing beats the restorative powers of Hanalei Bay.
BRIGGS
Agent Cooper, what's next for you sir?
COOPER
I'm not entirely sure. I've stockpiled a few weeks of
vacation time. Now might be the time to cash 'em in.

MAJOR BRIGGS
For starters, would you care to join me for an incredibly
pleasant evening of night fishing?
COOPER
(lightening up)
You can fish at night?
MAJOR BRIGGS
Heightens the meditative quality. Beta brain waves
increase precipitously.
COOPER
It sounds incredible.
MAJOR BRIGGS
How does sundown tomorrow sound.
TRUMAN
I've got a closet full of equipment. You're welcome to it,
Cooper.
COOPER
(delighted)
Gentlemen, I'm grateful. I didn't know how I was going
to leave Twin Peaks. You've built me a bridge; I'm not
saving good-bye, I'm going fishing.

7. INT. DINING ROOM
DOUGIE MILFORD, septuagenarian publisher of the Twin Peaks Gazette, has squared off
against his equally old brother, MAYOR DWAYNE MILFORD, over a plate of food.
DWAYNE
What's the matter, doesn't she feed you?
DOUGIE
You're just jealous.
DWAYNE
Jealous??? I wouldn't want to spend my time changing
diapers. Besides, she's cursed.
With his free hand, Dougie grabs Dwayne's ear, twisting as hard as he can. Dougie bellows

ED
Hey now, c'mon you two, knock it off.
DOUGIE
(still twisting Dwayne's ear)
I'm gonna stick his head in the gutter where it belongs!
Dwayne manages a swift kick to Dougie's shin. Dougie yelps, and finally lets go of the ear.
TRUMAN
Dougie, Mr. Mayor, gentlemen, I'll ask you to please
remember where you are. And why we're here.
The brothers go in opposite directions - in a huff, Doc walks over to Cooper and Pete, who
were watching this.
COOPER
Extraordinary display.
PETE
The Mayor and his brother. Dougie owns the newspaper.
They've had a running feud for about fifty years.
DOC
Nobody knows how it started. Something about an old
flame and a rumble seat. I'm not even sure they
remember anymore.
PETE
The nest's a little stirred up right now. Dougie's engaged
to be married. To a babe.
DOC
For the fifth time.
PETE
She's twenty-two. He's seventy-eight. Kind of a January-
December thing.
DOC
Remember the first time Dwayne ran for mayor ... when
was that?
TRUMAN
(who's rejoined them)
Uh, sixty-two, 1962.

DOC
Dougie wrote an editorial, came out against Dwayne.
And Dwayne was running unopposed.
PETE
Dwayne was dog catcher at the time. So he let all the
dogs from the pound loose in Dougie's house.
DOC
Damn dogs ate all the furniture. Broke up Dougie's third
marraige, too, as I recall.
Doc, Truman and Pete enjoy the memory.
COOPER
(after a beat, a rueful smile)
Harry, I'm really going to miss this place.
They look at each other - Cooper's department is imminent.

ACT TWO
8. INT. DINER - MORNING
NORMA is behind the counter setting up for the day, VIVIAN helping, laying out napkins.
Norma catches a look at herself in the MIRROR - then pinches her cheeks to give them color.
VIVIAN
You look marvelous. Suffering must agree with you.
NORMA
Why do you assume I'm suffering?
VIVIAN
This business. Your marriage. It's hard on a body, trying
to do what you're doing.
NORMA
This is my life.
VIVIAN
That's the point I'm trying to make.
Norma starts to respond to this latest affront when HANK and ERNIE walk through the front
door, all decked out in hunting gear, carrying rifles, which Hank is using to demonstrate.
HANK
The sight on yours drifts left; just aim a shade right -
VIVIAN
Behold the Great White Hunter. Try not to shoot
yourself in the foot, dear.
ERNIE
(defending his manhood; lying)
Darling, I used to shoot skeet. Didn't I tell you? I was
collegiate champion in the Little Ivy League.
HANK
We're after bigger game today.
NORMA
(first she's heard of it)
When did this little junket come up?
HANK
Ernie wants to see wilderness. You know a better way?
You girls mind the home front now.
He takes Ernie's arm and pulls him back out the door - as Ernie waves good-bye to Vivian.
Vivian turns to Norma.

VIVIAN
Henry seems unusually fond of my Ernie.
NORMA
Hank says it's like they've known each other in a past life.

VIVIAN
Hank's always given you a weird feeling.

10. INT. HIGH SCHOOL - DAY
Administrative office. VICE-PRINCIPAL GREEGE sits behind his desk, in conference
with Ed Hurley and Dr. Jacoby.
GREEGE
I want to be crystal clear about this. Your asking me to
admit a thirty-five year old woman to the senior class?
JACOBY
Strictly for medical reasons.
GREEGE
(glances at the file)
Well, she never did actually graduate. As I recall, she
left school to marry you, Ed.
ED
You got me there.
We HEAR SOME VOICES outside and Nadine bursts in the door, wearing a little pleated
skirt, puffy-sleeved blouse, tennis shoes and socks, hair in a ponytail - deep in teen-land.
NADINE
Eddie, how much longer? Class is starting!
ED
We'll be right out, Nadine. Just a few more minutes.
NADINE
Guess what - cheerleading tryouts tomorrow! I saw it on
the bulletin board -

ED
(ushering her out)
That's great, honey. Why don't you practice your splits?
He shuts the door, and sits back down. Greege tries to recover ...
GREEGE
She's certainly trying to recapture that old school spirit.
JACOBY
A classic case of clinical regression. Mr. Greege, what's
important here is that Nadine be allowed to maintain her
own reality. Being eighteen is all she can manage. And it
could be a lot worse. Be glad she's not napping in a crib.
Ed shudders. Greege reaches his decision.
GREEGE
We will admit her under one condition: she has to
perform like a regular student. Ed, my advice to you is
can forget hot dinners. Nadine'll be busy doing her
homework like every other senior.
Ed nods. Grimaces. Another body blow.
CUT TO:
11. INT. GREAT NORTHERN COOPER'S ROOM - DAY
FISHING GEAR is arrayed against one wall: rod 'n reel, net, waders, etc. COOPER'S
wearing a FISHING VEST while he packs. A black Samsonite is open on the bed - white
shirts stacked inside. He softly hums. The door is open behind him. He hears a knock.
COOPER
(without turning)
Bellman?
AUDREY
(entering, good-humored)
Customer relations. Has everything been satisfactory for
you during your stay with us, Mr. Cooper?
COOPER
Aside from the ugly shooting incident, no complaints.
AUDREY
(re: suitcase)
When are you leaving?
COOPER
I'm going fishing.

AUDREY
You're leaving.
COOPER
Audrey, I ... in effect I am leaving, yes.
AUDREY
(trying to sound devil may care)
So this is it? You save my life, then break my heart.
COOPER
Audrey I've explained to you my personal policy of not
getting involved with women who -
AUDREY
I know, I know. I'm a teenager.
COOPER
And you were involved in a case I was working on.
AUDREY
Someone must have hurt you once. Very badly.
COOPER
No. Someone was hurt by me. And I will never let that
happen again.
AUDREY
(being light)
What happened, did they die or something?
COOPER
As a matter of fact she did. Would you like to know how?
(after a beat, she looks away; trying to shock)
She was a material witness to a federal crime. We were
supposed to protect her. Twenty-four hours a day.
Myself and my partner, the man who taught me
everything I know about being a special agent. I fell in
love with her. And when the attempt on her life was
finally made I wasn't ready. Because I loved her. She
died in my arms. I was badly wounded. And my
partner, Windom Earle was his name, lost his mind. Do
you need me to be more specific?
Audrey, chastened and horrified, shakes her head.
COOPER (CONTINUED)
I like you, Audrey and I care for you. I'll always
consider you my friend.

AUDREY
(quoting him)
Friendship is the foundation of any lasting relationship.
COOPER
It's nice to be quoted accurately.
AUDREY
Well let me tell you something, Agent Cooper; one of
these days, before you know it, I'll be grown-up and on
my own. And you just better watch out.
COOPER
(likes the idea)
Okay Audrey. It's a deal.
With as much dignity as she can muster, she walks to the door, opens it and turns back to him.
AUDREY
There's only one problem with you. You're perfect.
She slips out, closing the door. Cooper sits down hard on the bed.
COOPER
Sometimes it's a burden.

12. INT. LEO JOHNSON'S HOUSE - DAY
CLOSE ON BOBBY'S REFLECTION in a MIRROR, trying on a shiny, blue sharkskin suit -
a little baggy. We PULL BACK to reveal the mirror is propped up in LEO'S LAP. Several
TIES are draped over one of Leo's arms, and a SHIRT hangs from the back of his head.
BOBBY
It's big - but it's bad.
He looks over at Shelly, wearing sweatpants and a man's shirt - tired and depressed.
SHELLY
Leo just got that suit. Fits him a little tighter.
BOBBY
Well it's a shame to let good threads go to waste.
(grabs a BLUE TIE off Leo's arm)
What do ya think- blue or green? I gotta look good. Ben
Horne's a man who notices these things.
SHELLY
You look great. Bobby, take me out tonight. I'll get all

SHELLY
I'll get a sitter! Bobby, please, I've got to get out of
here. I'm going crazy!
BOBBY
Sweetheart, lover, listen to me. If I land this "job" with
Mr. Horne, we're on easy street. I'll take care of you in
ways you never dreamed of. Hang in there, and let
Bobby do his thing.
(taking her in his arms)
It's for us, baby.
Over her shoulder, Bobby winks at Leo. He then he kisses her - long and deep. Shelly melts.
BOBBY
Okay?
She nods, placated. Bobby breaks away.
BOBBY (continued)
I gotta ramble. So which is it: blue or green?
Leo GURGLES.
BOBBY (continued)
He likes the green. My man Leo.
(grabs the green tie and heads for the door)
Doll face, cross your fingers, cross your toes. This is the
big time.
The door slams. We HOLD ON Shelly's face, abandoned. She looks over at Leo, holding
the mirror, a human valet - and starts to cry.

13. INT. SHERIFF TRUMAN'S OFFICE - DAY
CATHERINE MARTELL stands, looking out a window. Truman walks in carrying a cup of
coffee and a small PAPER SACK. Truman sees her, stops short. Nearly drops his coffee.
CATHERINE
Hello, Harry.
TRUMAN
Forgive my saying so, Catherine. But you're dead.

TRUMAN

CATHERINE
My husband and I have been duly reunited.
TRUMAN
(figuring)
Well, all things considered... Welcome home.
CATHERINE
(after a beat)
Any questions?
TRUMAN
(shifting gears, more business-like)
A couple.
CATHERINE
Am I under suspicion?
TRUMAN
I guess that depends on the answers I get. Maybe you'd
like to call your lawyer.
CATHERINE
That won't be necessary. I have nothing to hide.
TRUMAN
Good. For starters, where the hell have you been the past
two weeks?
CATHERINE
Do you believe in guardian angels, Harry?
TRUMAN
Angels? To tell the truth, I'm not so sure what I believe
in anymore.
CATHERINE
(voice gathering emotion)
I believe an angel saved my life.
That gets his attention. Catherine braces herself.
CATHERINE

voice I didn't recognize. He told me to meet him at the
drying shed. A vague threat was implied. So I went
there. I took a gun. That girl, what was her name?
TRUMAN
Shelly Johnson.
CATHERINE
(a memory steeped in melodrama)
She was tied up inside. A bomb went off. The rest is
just impressions, walls of fire crashing, screams. I have
no idea how I escaped. I came to in the woods. Afraid
for my life. More afraid than I've ever been. I dragged
myself through the dark for what seemed like forever,
not even sure if I was dead or alive. As the sky
lightened, things began to look familiar. The woods. A
path. A rock formation. I was flooded with memories
of my childhood. And I thought, well, this is what
heaven is. That's when I saw our old summer cabin in the
distance. I'd walked twenty miles through the night.
Heaven was Pearl Lakes. And only a guardian angel
could have brought me there.
Catherine pauses to wipe the tears from her eyes. Truman leans to grab a box of tissues.
Occupied, he doesn't see the brief sneer pass across Catherine's features.
CATHERINE
(taking a tissue)
Thank you.
(resuming her artful tale of woe)
We always kept a well-stocked pantry. I went in and
opened a can of tuna fish. And I waited for whoever it
was who had tried to kill me to come and finish the job.
No phone, no newspaper, no television. I tended my
wounds, a loaded gun at my side, terrified that each
moment might be my last.
TRUMAN
(swept away in spite of himself)
Why did you come back?
CATHERINE
(after a beat)
I ran out of tuna fish.
A little bit of the old Catherine bleeds through. Sarcasm and superiority. Truman takes a
closer look. Wonders just what she's really thinking. Where she's really been.

Catherine walks out, just as RICHARD TREMAYNE walks in. He makes a beeline for Lucy.
TREMAYNE
(beaming)
My dove; great news - I've quit smoking!
LUCY
What are you doing here?
TREMAYNE
I wanted to see you. I wanted - to be honest, I wanted to
talk about our bambino.
LUCY
Our bambino?
TREMAYNE
Lucy, I've been in a gnarly turmoil and do you know
what I've discovered? I, Dick Treymayne, am a terrible,
crashing bore. And what I desperately require in my life
is something, no, someone more important than myself to
think about, to care for. So perhaps you see why that
as a result, I must say, parenthood suddenly appeals to me.
LUCY
Parenthood?
TREMAYNE
Fatherhood, more specifically. And since I have no skills
in this area, nurturing is a relatively foreign concept, I've
enlisted myself in the "Happy Helping Hand" program;
part-time big brother to some adorable, homeless waif.
LUCY
Excuse me, are you the Dick Treymayne who works at
Horne's department store?
HAWK walks through reception, glaring at Tremayne.
TREMAYNE
Yes. And, Lucy, by the way, I have absolute confidence
that the child is mine.
Hawk makes a face, sickened. He rounds the corner, and runs smack into DEPUTY ANDY,
who's been listening to all of this. Hawk reacts, but Andy sshushes him. Andy steps into the
lobby, confronting Tremayne and Lucy.

ANDY
Lucy, Dick, I have something, I'd like to say.
(pauses, takes a deep breath, nothing comes out)
LUCY
Andy, what is it?
ANDY
I would like to say that we're all in a very difficult
position. I come from a large family. And Mama
always said she couldn't have fussin' and fightin' around
her when she had a bun in the oven. And until we know for
sure who's gonna be throwing that baseball, or building
that doll house we should all be friends.
(extends his hand to a very stunned Tremayne
who finally shakes it - wet noodle style)
So you two go right talk, and I'll see ya.
Lucy and Treymayne stare at each other. Andy backs out of reception and into the hall -
practically collapsing into Hawk's arms.
HAWK
(hissing whisper)
Andy are you crazy?
ANDY
Hawk, I know Lucy, and I know what'll get her. M orals
and manly behavior.
(pause, an unmanly moment of doubt)
You think I went too far?
They straighten up as Cooper enters past them, carrying fishing gear and goes into Truman's
office.
CUT TO:
15. INT. TRUMAN'S OFFICE
Truman's making some notes, when Cooper walks in. Truman stands up, smiling.
COOPER
Harry, I guess this is goodbye. There's a frying pan full
of steelhead trout out there with my name on 'em.
TRUMAN
That's why I figure you're gonna be needing this.
Truman picks the PAPER BAG off his desk, and hands it to Cooper; awkward with the
emotion he's feeling. Delighted, Cooper reaches into the bag and pulls out an intricately tied
FISHING FLY - the brightly colored feathers and tinsel, with streamers hanging down.

COOPER
It's incredible.
TRUMAN
When those steelhead are running upstream, they're only
thinking about one thing. Sex. A Green Butt Skunk
breaks their concentration.
COOPER
(riveted - holding the fly up, admiring it)
A Green Butt Skunk.
TRUMAN
Tied it myself. My dad taught me how, and his dad
taught him ...
COOPER
(touched)
I don't know what to say ...
TRUMAN
(points to the bag)
There's one more thing.
Cooper reaches in and pulls out a TINY PACKAGE, wrapped in tissue. He opens it,
revealing a small round badge, like a Boy Scout merit badge; an embroidered DOUGLAS
FIR TREE, with a SWORD in its center.
TRUMAN
The Bookhouse Boys Patch. We all carry it. I talked to
everybody. We feel you're one of us now.
COOPER
Harry, I'm honored beyond any ability I might have to
express myself.
TRUMAN
You wear that ... you ever need us, we'll be there.
Harry extends his hand, Cooper grips it. A pact.

Cooper moves on to Andy, who's almost in tears.
COOPER
Deputy Andy, your bravery is exceeded only by the size
of your heart. A rare combination indeed.
They shake hands. Andy's too moved to speak. Cooper moves on to Lucy.
COOPER
Lucy, I wish you, and yours, the very best. And I hope
you'll invite me to the wedding, whoever it might be.
They embrace. She sniffles. The front doors fly open and PRESTON KING, a black
Canadian Mountie in full, red uniform marches in. With him is a man who dresses just like
Cooper, SPECIAL AGENT ROGER HARDY.
MOUNTIE
Sheriff Truman?
TRUMAN
Yes?
MOUNTIE
This is Special Agent Roger Hardy of the FBI -
COOPER
(seeing him, stepping forward)
Hello, Roger, what are you doing here?
HARDY

Dale. We've got a problem. Effective immediately,
without pay, I regret to inform you of your suspension

Truman sits behind his desk, perturbed. Cooper sits opposite him. The Mountie leans
against the wall, towering over them. Agent Hardy enters.
HARDY
Cooper, I suspect you know why I'm here.
TRUMAN (interrupting)
I don't.
COOPER
(to Truman, re: Hardy)
Internal Affairs.
HARDY
We're the agents who watch the agents.
COOPER
(then to Hardy, re: Mountie)
And his presence refers to my crossing into Canada?
TRUMAN
Now wait a minute, that was directly related to the case
we were investigating.
MOUNTIE
Not without my knowing about it it wasn't.
COOPER
What's the charge, Roger - misfeasance?
Roger nods, serious.
TRUMAN
Mis-what?
COOPER
The improper and unlawful execution of an act that, in
itself, is lawful and proper. The rescue of Audrey Horne.
HARDY
In part. There are also disturbing allegations as to your
motives and your methods.
TRUMAN
What allegations?

Bobby confronts Ben's SECRETARY otuside his office door.
BOBBY
Did you tell him it's about the tape he got in the mail
yesterday and it's urgent? Would you tell him that
please?
The Secretary rolls her eyes, and goes back inside. Bobby fumes, now pacing, manic. He
doesn't notice Audrey watching him.
AUDREY
A little late for Halloween isn't it?
BOBBY
What?
AUDREY
What are you supposed to be, a lounge lizard?
BOBBY
Shouldn't you be in school?
AUDREY
School numbs my butt. Shouldn't you be?
BOBBY
I'm trying to get an appointment with your father.
AUDREY
What on earth do you want to talk to him about?
BOBBY
A job - business. It's personal.

You're up to something, Bobby Briggs. But I'm sure that's
none of my business. Count to ten.
She disappears into her father's office. Bobby's confused but counts anyway.
BOBBY
One ... two ... three ... four ... five ... six ...
The office door opens wide: Audrey smiles, success. Invites him in.
AUDREY
First rule of business is you have to know who to talk to.

Opera plays on a boom box. Looking slightly disheveled, Ben sits, stocking feet up on the
desk, drinking a milkshake and playing with a weird electronic toy. He doesn't look up.
BOBBY
(business-like demeanor)
Mr. Horne, I know you're a busy man and I respect that
and so I'll get right to the point -
BEN
I suppose you're here to ask me for Audrey's hand in
marraige or some similar adolescent befuddlement
BOBBY
No.
BEN
(looks at him for the first time)
Well, what then?
Bobby sees the ENVELOPE he mailed Ben, laying unopened on the desk. Bobby picks it up,
rips the seal, and takes out a CASSETTE TAPE.
BEN (CONTINUED)
I already have somebody to open my mail, kid.

There's a "bug" in my office.

20. INT. GREAT NORTHERN HALL/LOBBY - DAY
Two HOUSE SECURITY MEN escort Bobby out of the hotel. He's been roughed up. In the
lobby, Audrey looks over and sees Bobby pass by, flanked by the thugs.
AUDREY
Bobby! Herman, Donald; I really don't appreciate friends
of mine being treated like this. I may have to speak to
Father about this.
Her eyes shoot daggers. They're afraid of her. They let go of Bobby.
AUDREY (Cont'd)
Run along, boys.
The Thugs move off.
BOBBY
(to Thugs, playing the tough guy)
And you can tell your boss that tape's not the original.
Audrey clocks this last bit of info. She and Bobby walk away, arm-in-arm.
AUDREY
I can't imagine what all this was about.
BOBBY
Audrey, that's twice you've saved my bacon. We could be
talking sainthood. Anything I can do for you?

21. INT. SHERIFF'S STATION CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
The VIDEOTAPE of Cooper, recorded at One-Eyed Jack's, plays on the TV MONITOR
Hardy and the Mountie sit on one side of the table, Cooper sits on the other.
HARDY
What was the purpose of your first visit to One-Eyed
Jack's?
COOPER
To gather information about the murder of Laura Palmer,
from, this man, Jacques Renault.
HARDY
Who you apparently lured back across the border, where
he was wounded during arrest and subsequently murdered
that night in the hospital.
COOPER
Renault was a material witness to Laura's murder. Leland
Palmer confessed to Jacques' murder, which I believe he
commited to prevent Renault from ever testifying against
him. Are you judging me responsibile for that?
Coooper looks at the Mountie. He takes TWO PHOTOGRAPHS out of a manilla envelope
and tosses them in the middle of the table: one of BLACKIE'S DEAD BODY, the other of
DEAD EMORY BATTIS.
MOUNTIE
Let's talk about your second visit ...
COOPER
To rescue Audrey Horne from her kidnappers.
MOUNTIE
Who both ended up dead.
Hardy gives Mountie a look - he'll handle this.
HARDY
You know procedure. Crossing the border without
contacting Canadian authorities is a serious breach.
Under any circumstances.

21. CONTINUED:
COOPER
I'm not disputing that. Is it the Bureau's position I'm
responsibile for these deaths?
HARDY
That's what we're trying to determine. This entire
matter has been brought to our attention because Mountie
King was in the middle of a sting operation to nail this
man, Jean Renault.
A photograph of Jean Renault is displayed.
MOUNTIE
We worked six months to set this up; one night you march
in, Renault escapes, these two are dead and the cocaine we
were using to set him up is stolen from the premises.
COOPER
I don't know anything about cocaine. But you've
miscounted; three people were killed., Jean Renault
killed Blackie, I didn't know until now about the Battis
murder. And a bodyguard who turned his gun on me was
killed in self-defense.
Hardy looks at the Mountie - who's been thrown by this.
HARDY
So we've got crossing jurisdictional borders, three dead
bodies and international trafficking of drugs.
COOPER
Roger, I admit to the border crossing. You already know
the extent of my involvement with the killings. I hope
you know me better than to suspect I'd have any part of a
drug transaction.
HARDY
(eyes boring holes)
I won't know that until you prove it, Cooper. I will tell
you DEA's been called in to investigate. And you've got
twenty-four hours to assemble your defense; in the
meantime I'll require that you surrender your gun and
badge.
Pause. Cooper removes his GUN from the shoulder holster, and lays it on the table. From his
shirt pocket he produces the case containing his BADGE, places it next to his gun. Hardy nods
to the Mountie; he opens the door, summons Truman in, who's waiting just outside. Truman
sees Cooper's badge and gun. Cooper stands, smiles at Harry. He walks out, head high.

HARDY
(motioning to a chair)
Sheriff, I'll need to ask you a few questions.
TRUMAN
I'll stand.
HARDY
Let me begin by saying that whatever Agent Cooper is
guilty of will not be held against you; your cooperation
will be very useful - and greatly appreciated by the FBI.
TRUMAN
If I understand the law correctly, you (to Mountie)
need extradition papers in order to get a statement from
me. And you (to Hardy) need a subpeona from a judge.
Unless either of you have the appropriate paperwork -
you can take my cooperation and stuff It.
HARDY
That attitude will not serve you or Agent Cooper -
TRUMAN
It's not an attitude, it's a promise. I've had nothing, but
respect for the FBI since the day Cooper walked into my
office. He's the finest law man I've ever known; check
that, the finest man period. I don't know what
information you have or where you got it from, but I can
tell you this ... it's dead wrong
Truman turns on his heels and walks out.

TWO WRESTLERS work out in another corner of the gym, under the WRESTLING

Nadine brightens.

Alright, Nadine, let's start you off with tumbling
Nadine bounces over to center stage. A MALE CHEERLEADER stands by to spot her. He
rolls his eyes - condescending. Nadine, grinning ear-to-ear, walks backwards. Further and
further, as if this were her routine. We HEAR a few laughs.
With a little jump, she starts running forward, and does a FRONT FLIP, followed by another
FRONT DOUBLE FLIP, into a series of CARTWHEELS, landing right in front or the
aghast MALE CHEERLEADER. She picks him up by his waist and tosses him into the air.
NADINE
Corkscrew!
And he indeed SPINS through the air, across the gym, landing on the matt on top of the
wrestlers. The Coach looks from the hapless cheerleader over to Nadine - very impressed.
Nadine beams proudly, barely out of breach.

Well that's just great, Bobby. I'm glad things went so

CAMERA MOVES down, shooting Shelly through the spokes of Leo's wheelchair.
SHELLY (CONTINUED)
Yes, I still love you. Bobby, I've been thinking, we're
really gonna have to put Leo somewhere - in a home.
The wheel of Leo's chair turns one full revolution, rolling slowly through the frame, and stops.
SHELLY (CONTINUED)
It's not worth it. I don't want the money. I want a life.
Shelly turns and starts to sit; stops, looking at Leo. Something's wrong, but she can't place it.
SHELLY (CONTINUED)
Bobby, I think he moved. I swear, Leo moved.
(listening)
Okay, maybe I am losing my mind. That's what I've
been trying to tell you. Get over here tomorrow, first
thing. Please. Bye, lover.
Shelly hangs up, and goes over to Leo - the foam still hanging from his mouth - looking quite
mad. Shelly looks at where she thought the chair was, and where it is now. Could it be? She
shakes her head. A long day. Shelly moves around in front of Leo, peering cautiously into his
eyes.
SHELLY
Leo Johnson, are you in there?
Nothing. Shelly turns away, reaching for a towel. As Leo BLOWS A BUBBLE.

Cooper sits in a booth, drinking coffee, and studying a small PORTABLE CHESS BOARD,
wearing jeans and a flannel shirt. Truman walks in, relieved to see Cooper, sits opposite.
TRUMAN
Who are you playing, with?
COOPER
Windom Earle. A formidable opponent.
Cooper moves his pawn, then writes his move down on a piece of paper. He puts the note in an
ENVELOPE, already addressed to Windom Earle, Personals Dept., USA TODAY.
TRUMAN
I've been looking all over for you.
COOPER
I went to the library. Took a walk. I got hungry.
TRUMAN
What was at the library?
COOPER
William O. Douglas. A man from this neck of the
woods, and one of the great ministers of justice. I was
seeking, inspiration and I found it there.
TRUMAN
Preparing your defense?
COOPER
Yes. Douglas said in times of trouble a man should
immerse himself in wilderness. I'm going fishing.
(rises, lays his money on the counter)
You know, Harry, somewhere between William
Douglas and the Dalai Lama lies the perfect man.
Their attention is drawn to Norma, angrily folding up all the tableclothes and dumping them
in a box behind the counter.

ethics -
NORMA
Ethics? I'm your daughter -

NORMA
What about standards for common decency? Kindness?
Or don't those fall within the standards of your
"profession" -

Hefting the gun, Truman moves to the door, stands to the side, then pulls the door open

You are in direct contradiction to a state of loving
acceptance; incapable of it. Direct denial.
COOPER
Major Briggs, if I may ask a personal question ... do you
love yourself?
MAJOR BRIGGS
Very much.
Cooper's fascinated. He rotates his marshmallow in the fire.
COOPER
Then it stands to reason that Leland Palmer didn't.
MAJOR BRIGGS
One could draw that conclusion. There are powerful
forces of evil in the world. It is some men's fate to
confront great darkness. We each choose how to react. If
the choice is fear, then we become vulnerable to darkness.
Cooper looks around, at the literal darkness surrounding him.
COOPER
Tomorrow I face my own demons, Major Briggs. But,
thanks to you, I believe I will do so without fear. I
carefully considered my actions before proceeding. I
