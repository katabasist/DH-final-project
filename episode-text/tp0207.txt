ACT ONE
A1. INT. SHERIFF'S STATION - DAY
Cooper, Hawk, Gerard, and Gordon Cole are gathered near the front, waiting for Truman
who joins them from down the corridor.
TRUMAN
They're waiting for us up at the Great Northern.
COOPER
All the guests will be in the lobby?
TRUMAN
Full cooperation. Hawk you've got the warrant for
Harold Smith's apartment?
HAWK
(shows it)
On my way there.
COOPER
Stay in touch, let us know what you dig up. Gordon, I
understand you're hitting the road for Bend, Oregon.
COLE
I'M ON MY WAY TO BEND, OREGON.
OFFICIAL BUSINESS. REAL HUSH-HUSH.
GOOD LUCK TO ALL OF YOU.

Knocks on the door.
TRUMAN'S VOICE
Mr. Smith? Mr. Smith, it's the police, open the door ...
Mr. Smith, we have a warrant to search your apartment ...
The doorknob turns. The door swings open; a beat, then TRUMAN, COOPER and HAWK
pour into the room, weapons drawn. The room has been ravaged. Smith's diaries, torn and
tattered lie in a pile of paper in the middle of the room. CAMERA follows Truman and
Cooper across the room and up to the window looking in the greenhouse ... where we see
Smith's legs suspended swinging He's hung himself. Cooper and Truman look at each other.
There's a note taped to the window. Cooper reads it:
COOPER
"Je suis une ame solitaire."
(translating)
I am a lonely soul.

3. INT. SMITH'S APARTMENT DAY
FORENSIC field men at work , sifting through the pile of torn and savaged papers in the
center of the room. One examines the window looking into the second room. Truman
supervises. TWO PARAMEDICS wheel out a gurney; Harold Smith's remains, bagged.
Cooper enters leading a haggard looking PHIL GERARD, the one-armed man, still in his
"Mike" stare. Cooper raises a hand, stops the gurney, gestures to Gerard. Gerard puts his
hand on the bag, closes his eyes. The working cops stop and stare.
COOPER
Was he here?
GERARD
(pause, opens his eyes)
Bob never lingers after death.
COOPER
Was he here?
GERARD
(sahakes his head)
Bob has not visited here.

Truman rolls his eyes. Cooper nods to the Paramedics; they wheel Smith out. Gerard,
unsteady on his feet, seeks refuge in a chair. Truman takes Cooper quietly aside.
TRUMAN
Think this is a good idea, in front of the men and all?
COOPER
Harry, we're at the chicken-soup stage of this crime.
TRUMAN
How's that?
COOPER
"It couldn't hurt."
(a blank look)
That's something people say back in Philadelphia.
Truman produces Smith's wallet.
TRUMAN
We're trying to get ahold of Jacoby in Hawaii; Smith
was a patient.
COOPER
Was the agoraphobia for real. Did he ever go outside.
TRUMAN
He was a class "A" nutball, that much seems clear.
COOPER
Blood type?
TRUMAN
We'll have it soon.
(a glance back at Gerard)
Wouldn't hurt for Jacoby to get a gander at this guy
either.
(a second glance)
Looks a little green around the gills.
COOPER
It's not easy being "Mike."
(nods, moves to him)
Would you like some coffee, "Mike"?
Gerard shakes his head. Hawk unearths something from the large paper scrap pile, moves
with it to Cooper.
HAWK
Take a look at this.

Uncle Leland, Aunt Sarah ...
SARAH
What is it, dear?
LELAND
Would you like some coffee?
Maddy shakes her head, sits beside them.

Did you sleep well?
MADDY
Very well, thanks.
Sarah pats her hand. Leland and Sarah go back to their paper.

completely.
MADDY
You do?
SARAH
You've been a wonderful help.
LELAND
You'll come back to visit, won't you?
MADDY
Of course.
LELAND
It's not as if Missoula's at the far end of the solar
system.
MADDY
Hardly.
LELAND
That's fine, then. You know we love you.

BOBBY
We?
SHELLY

SHELLY
The police impounded it -
BOBBY
We'll get it back -
SHELLY
They said if it was used in the commission of a crime it
becomes property of the state -
BOBBY
But they haven't charged him with anything -
SHELLY
(a shrill note)
I didn't make the rules!
BOBBY
Okay, okay -
SHELLY
It's like you're blaming me for something -
BOBBY
I'm not blaming you. Take it easy.
(back to Leo)
Leo was into a lot of stuff and he was in it for the money.
SHELLY
He must've had partners. We could ask them.
BOBBY
(a look)
Not a good idea.
SHELLY
But so you think Leo had money?
BOBBY
Yes. And from the look of that checkbook he never saw
the inside of a bank. He had hiding places.

Leo needs new shooooes ...

probably last you a few decades.
LEO
New shooooes.
Bobby gets a hint of something
BOBBY
(why not ask)
He buy any shoes lately?
SHELLY
No. The police went through everything he owned.
LEO
New shoooes ...
SHELLY

A weak and pale Phillip Gerard sits in the reception area, attended to by Doc Hayward. The
plumber we saw in #006, MR ZIPPER is on a ladder, working on the nozzles of the sprinkler
system he's in the middle of installing throughout the station.
CLOSE on a couple of steaming cups of coffee as they're carried into the conference room,
where Truman and Cooper, are seated at the table. Wearing surgical gloves, Cooper is
paging through the diary they found at Harold Smith's. Open beside him is the original diary
they found in Laura's room. Cooper compares the two, takes a sip of coffee.
COOPER
This is Laura's handwriting.
TRUMAN
Why would she keep two diaries?
COOPER
The one we found earlier was a record of events on the
surface. This one apparently tells the story of her inner
life.
TRUMAN
The answer may be in there.
COOPER
Undoubtedly. It's a shame. Mr. Smith saw fit to
mutilate about 45% of the contents.
Hawk enters, carrying an envidence bag containing some torn scraps of paper.
HAWK
This what you're looking for?

COOPER
Precisely.
Cooper opens the bag, takes out the scraps and examines them with a magnifying glass,
comparing them to the second diary.
TRUMAN
(to Hawk)
Those are the scraps you found near the railroad car.
Hawk nods.
COOPER
Yes. Yes. This is where the scraps came from.
(opens the book towards the end)
Look at this.
He points to a section torn out near the end of the book.
TRUMAN
Smith ready did a job on this thing.
COOPER
No, look at the way the pages are torn clean, ripped out
at the roots. Smith ripped and slashed his way through,
like the others we found in his apartment.
(a closer detail)
And look at the edges here at the back; yellowed and
curled. Nine pages. They were taken some time ago.
TRUMAN
By Smith?
COOPER
By the killer. The day she died.
Truman takes the book to examine it.
TRUMAN
Before she gave the book to Smith?
COOPER
Unless I'm very much mistaken.
Doc Hayward appears in the doorway, with news, a piece of paper in his hand.
HAYWARD
Excuse me, fellas ...

COOPER
What was Harold Smith's bloodtype, Doc?
HAYWARD
(used to this by now; reads the note in his hand)
"O."
COOPER
The night Laura died Harold Smith never left his
apartment.
HAYWARD
Agent Cooper, just so you know, Gerard is refusing to
take his drug -
COOPER
You mean "Mike."
HAYWARD
Whatever his name is, he's getting weak and unstable. I
can't recommend we let him go much longer without his
medication.
TRUMAN
(reading the diary)
Oh my Lord ... oh my Lord ...
COOPER
Harry?
TRUMAN
(reads)
"... he can can come into my mind, a man who can slip
in and out of you like a wind that goes unnoticed ... it
just struck me that his name is a warning in itself; B-O-
B: Beware of Bob."
COOPER
(rising, galvanized)
Hawk, bring the cruiser around, Harry, bring the diary,
I'll get Gerard, we're taking him to the Great Northern

A police presence in the lobby has created quite a stir: DEPUTIES are shepherding an
interesting mix of HOTEL GUESTS, one by one, past Gerard, seated front of the
fireplace. Included are the members of a HIGH SCHOOL MARCHING BAND, each
holding their instrument.
Gerard, pale and sweaty, scrutinizes each guest as they are brought before him, shakes his
head and they move on. Cooper and Truman stand beside him, Cooper stalwart, Truman
exuding a healthy skepticism.
Doc Hayward is nearby, keeping an eye on Gerard.
SUNSHIH TOJAMURA is shown to Gerard. Gerard shakes his head.

What's the meaning of this? Sheriff, what's going on,
Why are my guests being hounded like this?
TRUMAN
(moving Horne off)
We're done here, Mr. Horne -
COOPER
(to the milling crowd)
Thank you all ladies and gentlemen. If everyone would
please just go about your business.
HAYWARD
We've got to get him to a bed.
TRUMAN
Mr. Horne, could we have the use of a room?
HORNE
Does he want to check-in?
A look from Cooper asks a favor. Horne complies, points.
HORNE (CONTINUED)
Down the corridor.
Horne moves to the front desk to retrieve a key.
COOPER

AUDREY
I've spent enough time in bed lately.
BEN
You're looking much, much better.
He tries to kiss her. She turns her cheek. Looks at him. Ben starts evasive actions, checks his
desk calender.
BEN (CONTINUED)
Audrey, dear, if you'd excuse me, I've got a business
meeting scheduled -
AUDREY
I know about One-Eyed Jacks.

all my life. I know every move in your book, so my
advice is: don't waste your breath.
BEN

I see ... your point.
AUDREY
I was there. I saw you.
BEN
Uh-huh.
AUDREY
I need to ask you some so questions.
BEN
Ask away.
AUDREY
No lying.
BEN

I'll do my best.
AUDREY
You'd better do better than that.
BEN
Ask.
AUDREY
Did you have anything to do with my being kidnapped?

How long have you owned One-Eyed Jacks?

Five years.
AUDREY

BEN
She was only there a brief time -
AUDREY
Did you know?
BEN
Yes.
AUDREY
Did you in any way encourage her to work there?
BEN
No, I had no idea. She asked for a job at the
department store, Battis sent her without my knowing -
AUDREY
But you found out.

Ben's face twists in a contortion of pain and horror. He shakes his head, but we're not sure if
it's anger or denial. His voice quavers, tears fill his eyes.
BEN
I ... loved ... her.
He breaks down. Audrey regards her father coldly. She starts away.
BEN (CONTINUED)
What are you doing? Where are you going?
(she's at the door)
What are you going to do?
Audrey stops at the door, gives him a long look. Then exits. Ben tries es to dry his tears,

Twenty years in April.
Nadine's brow furrows up. Ed tries to gesture to Norma behind Nadine's back.

'Bout six weeks now, isn't it Norma?

ED
That's right.
Another helpless gesture to Norma
NADINE

Say Norma, you're not mad or anything that Eddie and
I are sort of going out or anything are you?
NORMA
You and Ed?

No. No. Why should I be?
NADINE
No reason. I know you two broke up and everything.
I'm just so sweet on him is all.

Isn't he just the dreamiest? I can't wait for the start of

NORMA
No. Can't wait.

I loved her, too. I stood there and watched her go.
Watched her assistant carry out her bags.
Pause. Something breaks through Pete's melancholic haze.
PETE
Assistant?
TRUMAN
Asian fella. Never seen him before. Woo?
PETE
What'd he look like?
TRUMAN
Average height. Medium build. Pony tail.
PETE
That was her cousin. Jonathan.
TRUMAN
She said he was her assistant. British accent -
PETE
This guy could barely speak English.
TRUMAN
(knows in his heart)
Pete, this was the same guy.
PETE
Harry, I've got a bad feeling.
TRUMAN
I'm right there with you.
Pause.

23. INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
Remanants of Laura's diary are spread out over the entire conference table. Cooper
examines the remaining intact pages in the book, making notes, using a magnifying glass and
what scraps he has in front of him to try and reconstruct the contents. He steps away from
the table, picks up a cup of coffe and his microrecorder.
COOPER
(tired and intense)
Diane, it's 5:45 pm, I'm in the conference room with the
remains of Laura Palmer's diary. A great deal of it has
been destroyed, many of Laura's secrets along with it.
Much of what I've been able to decipher supports the
contention of the one-armed man; there are repeated
references to "Bob". He was a threatening presence in her
life from early adolescence. There are intimations of
abuse, molestation. On a regular basis. He is referred
to, on more than one occasion, as a friend of her father's.
And I've just uncovered this entry, dated less than two
weeks before her death.
(reads from diary)
"One of these days I'm going to tell the world about
Ben Horne. I'm going to tell the world who Ben Horne
really is."
The door swings open. Audrey Horne is standing in the doorway.
COOPER (CONTINUED)
Audrey ...
Cooper turns off the tape recorder. Audrey enters, closes the door behind her.
AUDREY
I had to see you, I'm sorry -
COOPER
Are you all right?
She waves off the question. Something much larger looming over her. Trying to bear up
under its weight.
AUDREY
I spoke with my father.
COOPER
Okay.
AUDREY
He was sleeping with her. With Laura. I don't know for
how long. Maybe quite a while.
(CONTINUED)

23. CONTINUED:
COOPER
(quiet, soothing)
Okay.
AUDREY
She was up at One-Eyed Jack's. Working there. My
father owns the place. That's what I found out.
COOPER
Are you sure?
AUDREY
Yes.
(pause, composes herself)
And Laura knew it too. Laura knew it too.
Pause. Cooper moves to the door.
AUDREY (CONTINUED)
What are you gonna do?
COOPER
(opens the door)
Harry?
AUDREY
What are you gonna do?
Cooper takes her by the shoulders.
COOPER
(quietly)
I don't want you to have to testify. I'm going to try to
see that that doesn't happen.
AUDREY
(crumbling)
What are you gonna do?
COOPER
Don't say a word to anyone. Go home. Stay in your
room. I'll try to come see you later. Don't answer the
phone -
Truman appears in the doorway.
AUDREY
You're going, to arrest him.
(CONTINUED)

23. CONTINUED:(2)
COOPER
Yes.
She gently disengages herself from him, nods. Tries to smile, but the attempt fails.
AUDREY
I've got to tell Johnny.
COOPER
Why don't you do that?
AUDREY
(faint)
Okay.
She moves out like a sleepwalker.
COOPER
(to Truman)
Have somebody drive her back to the hotel.
TRUMAN
What's going on
COOPER
We need a warrant. A warrant for the arrest of Ben
Horne.
They look at each other. Truman nods, grimly, heads out. Cooper looks sadly down at the
remanants of the diary.

25- INT. PALMER HOUSE - NIGHT
SARAH PALMER crawls in on the floor. She appears to have been drugged, fighting to stay
awake. She looks up at the living room and has a vision: A PALE HORSE is standing in the
middle of the room.
DISSOLVE TO:
26. INT. PALMER HOUSE - NIGHT
Madeleine enters, carrying a couple of packed bags which she sets down, calling back to
someone outside of the room.
MADELEINE
I'm going to leave these down here tonight. I'll be all
ready to get an early start.
Behind her in the alcove, Ben Horne comes down the stairs, stops to look at himself in the
mirror. He smoothes back his hair. We move to notice that the face staring back out of the
mirror is "Bob."
We follow Ben's hand into his pocket. He takes out a pair of rubber surgical gloves and starts
to put them on as he moves toward the living room.
Madeleine has finished fussing over his luggage. She turns and notices Sarah stretched out on
the floor beside the sofa.
MADELEINE
Aunt Sarah? ... Aunt Sarah? ...
As she bends over to look at her, Ben moves in behind her, raising his hands.

A fax is arriving over the fax machine. Ben Horne crouches over the machine, eagerly rips off
the transmission as it's completed. He scans it, smiles and folds it.

HORNE
Good news, Mr. Tojamura.
TOJAMURA is seated in the office, his VALET a shadow.
HORNE (CONTINUED)
My brother Jerry has spoken with your people in Osaka,
he's checked your references with the Tokyo banks and
the answer to your proposal my good friend is a big
thumbs-up.
TOJAMURA
We appreciate your promptness.
HORNE
(shaking his hand)
Speaking for the entire community of Twin Peaks, I
can't tell you how pleased we are to welcome you into
the Ghostwood fold.
TOJAMURA
Thank you so much.
He snaps his fingers; the Valet produces a thick sheath of contracts.
TOJAMURA
Contracts. For your perusal.
HORNE
And fast approval, I'm sure.
Horne accepts the contracts. A knock at the door. The door opens. Cooper, Truman and
Hawk. Truman walks right in.
HORNE (CONTINUED)
Sheriff?
TRUMAN
Mr. Horne, we'd like you to come with us please.
HORNE
Fine, I happen to be in a meeting -
TRUMAN
(blowing up)
You're wanted for questioning in the murder of Laura
Palmer, is that specific enough for you?
Horne looks from Truman to Cooper.

HORNE
You're insane -
Tojamura has retreated a few steps. Horne turns to him.
HORNE (CONTINUED)
There's been a dreadful mistake.
TRUMAN
Come with us now or would you rather go out through
your lobby in handcuffs.
HORNE
Cooper, what kind of a sick joke is this?
COOPER
You'd better do as he says.
They take him by the arms. Horne struggles, yelling, composure completely gone.
HORNE
No! No! You can't do this! You can't do this!
Truman and Hawk drag him out the door, Cooper follows
Tojamura watches them exit. His eyes are bright. He may be laughing.

29. INT. BLUE PINE LODGE - NIGHT
Dim light. In his bathrobe and slippers, Pete putters around the kitchen, humming, heating
up a glass of milk. Far off he hears a gust of wind, the sound of a door in the distance. He
looks up, nothing, finishes fixing his milk. Takes the glass, at a last minute grabs a cookie and
heads off. He comes around the corner and nearly screams when he finds himself nearly face
to face with Tojamura.
PETE
Who the heck are you?
Tojamura advances towards him, doesn't say a word.

PETE (CONTINUED)
(retreating slightly)
How'd you get in here? Hey - hey!
Tojamura grabs him and kisses him. Pete drops the glass of milk to the floor. Pete struggles.
Tojamura pulls back from the embrace. Pete frantically tries to wipe off his lips.
TOJAMURA
Since the moment we met, I've found myself strangely
attracted to you.
PETE
Mister, you better get out of here -
TOJAMURA
There's something about your eyes; they're warm and
deep -
(no trace of an accent; Catherine's voice)
- and blue as the open sky.
PETE
(now he's really confused)
Huh?
TOJAMURA
Pete ... it's me.
(no response; less patient)
It's Catherine, you dummy.
Tojamura takes off his glasses. Pete sees something he recognizes. Tears come to his eyes.
PETE
Oh my God ... you look terrible.
CUT TO:
30. INT. SHERIFF'S STATION - NIGHT
Truman, Cooper and Hawk enter with Ben Horne. The Log Lady is waiting in the reception
area; she rises. Cooper notices her, looks to Truman.
TRUMAN
(to Hawk)
Take Mr. Horne down to the holding cell.
Hawk and Horne move off. Cooper moves to the Log Lady, Truman follows.
LOG LADY
(quiet, intense)
You must go to the Roadhouse. Everything points that
way.

COOPER
Why?
LOG LADY
(a gesture to her log)
It won't say. But it insists.
Cooper looks at Truman.
TRUMAN
We can't question Horne 'til his lawyer gets here; he's
flying back from Japan, won't be here 'til morning. I
could use a beer myself.
COOPER
(another look at the Log Lady)
All right.
CUT TO:
31. INT. ROADHOUSE - NIGHT
A band is playing on stage. DONNA HAYWARD enters. She looks for and finds where
James is seated, his back to her, reading.
DONNA
You heard about Harold Smith?
JAMES
Yeah.
She sits. James sets the book down. They look at each other.
JAMES (CONTINUED)
It's not your fault, Donna
DONNA
(hurting)
No?
JAMES
I don't think it's anybody's fault. He was a sick guy.
DONNA
He wasn't bad.
JAMES
You don't think he killed Laura?
(CONTINUED)
#2.007
33.
31. CONTINUED:
DONNA
I don't think so. I think he was ... mixed up. I think he
was hurt inside in a way I didn't understand.
JAMES
Everybody's hurt inside. That doesn't mean you can go
around trying to knock somebody's brains out.
DONNA
I think he was defending himself. His life was in that
room, his whole life, and we violated that -
JAMES
Donna, are you defending him?
DONNA
No. But he didn't kill Laura. Maybe he was sick and
what he did was wrong. But he didn't deserve to die for
it.
JAMES
You better be clear about this; that was his choice. If he
didn't want to live there was nothing you or the police or
anybody could do to change that.
DONNA
(a sad realization)
Kind of like Laura.
JAMES
I guess so.
DONNA
(rueful)
God ... nobody told us life was going to be like this.
James takes her hand.
JAMES
Maybe nobody knew.
They look at each other other, draw some comfort from the thought.
JAMES (CONTINUED)
Go for a ride?
She nods. Tears in her eyes. They exit. We pick up and stay with Cooper and Truman as they
enter through another door, move to the bar and order beers. The singer on stage begins a
new song.

31. CONTINUED:(2)
TRUMAN
What do we do?
COOPER
I don't know. Wait.
They watch the band; it's an emotional song, filled with regret and longing. People lean
forward, drawn in by the song, but also by a mounting, palpable sense of tension and fear in
the air.
Cooper picks up on it, looks at Truman, who feels it as well.
INTERCUT:
32. COOPER'S POV - THE STAGE
In mid-song, the band vanishes from the stage; the Giant appears in the center of the stage.
He looks right at Cooper.
GIANT
It's happening again. It's happening again.
Cooper appears to be the only one who sees him. He looks again, unsure of what he's seen.
The Giant fades away, replaced by the band once again, who finish the song.
Cooper sits stock still, shocked by what he's seen. Truman looks at him.
TRUMAN
Cooper? Cooper?
Someone pats Cooper on the shoulder. Cooper looks up. It's the old ROOM SERVICE
WAITER from the Great Northern Hotel. His eyes are filled with tears. He shakes his head,
pats Cooper on the shoulder again and moves off.
Cooper stares straight ahead.
COOPER
He's killed again.
