ACT ONE
FADE IN:
1. EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY
SHERIFF TRUMAN angry and frustrated, walks with AGENT COOPER, HAWK, and
ALBERT ROSENFIELD through the hospital/morgue parking lot. It's early. A thick fog,
hangs in the air.
ALBERT
The short answer is it's the work of the same ghoul who
killed Laura.
(drops a cellophane container in Cooper's hands)
More fan mail. An "O" under Maddy's ring fingernail ...
(he gives another cellophane container to Cooper)
She had strands of fur clutched in her right hand.
COOPER
What kind of fur?
ALBERT
White fox. The strands are laced with formaldehyde.
A dead animal. Stuffed.
Truman's not listening. He's got the killer in custody, or so he thinks. Investigative details are
no longer his concern.
TRUMAN
I should make the calls. Leland will know how to get a
hold of Maddy's family -
COOPER
Don't. Don't call anybody. I need twenty-four hours.
TRUMAN
For what?
COOPER
(quiet, internal)
To finish this.
TRUMAN
(his frustration begins to show)
It is finished.
Stalemate. Albert intervenes, takes Cooper aside.

ALBERT
Cooper ... an observation?
COOPER
Yes, Albert.
ALBERT
I don't where this is headed, but the only one of us with
the coordinates for this destination in their hardware is
you. Lock in. Go on whatever Vision Quest you require,
stand on the rim of the volcano. Stand alone and do
your dance. Just find this beast before he takes another
bite.
(turns to Truman)
And perhaps you could follow behind him with a
buglight attached to a pith helmet.
Albert offers a snide farewell wave to Truman, peels off to his automobile. Cooper steps back
to Truman and Hawk.
COOPER
(to self, almost tenderly)
God help me, I don't know where to start.
Hawk puts a hand on his shoulder.
HAWK
You're on the path. You don't need to know where it
leads. Just follow.
Cooper looks at him. Then to Truman.
TRUMAN
(despite what he believes)
Good luck.

2. INT. DOUBLER DINER - DAY
DONNA HAYWARD sits in a booth in the morning sun, sipping coffee and working on her
homework. A smiling JAMES HURLEY enters passing by ERNIE NILES who sits at the
counter reading the sports page. Donna beams at James.
DONNA
I thought you'd never get here.

James smiles and gives Donna a morning-after kiss. He slides in across from Donna. Takes a
sip of her coffee.
JAMES
I went out for a ride this morning. Buried the needle.
The engine sounded like music, like hundreds of people
singing some huge song.
DONNA
(with affection)
What were they singing about?
JAMES
(in kind)
What do you think?
DONNA
(loving memory, not coy)
Last night. I could sing about last night.
James digs in his pocket and takes out a small gift-wrapped package.
JAMES
This is for you.
(hands it to Donna)
Open it.
Donna opens the box. Takes out a beautiful, but simple ring with the smallest of diamonds.
DONNA
Oh, James.
JAMES
I wasn't sure what size to get. The girl at the jewelry
store has these big hands so I had to guess ...
(taking her hand)
But I bet ...
He slides the ring on her finger, where one would wear a wedding band.
JAMES
(it fits)
Perfect.
DONNA
James ... ?

I think we should always be together.
DONNA

Really?
JAMES
(wry)
Yeah. That okay with you?
DONNA
(re the ring, their lives, everything)
It's perfect.
James leans across the table, means to kiss her, the table and coffee between them. Donna
laughs, James grins. Then gathers her into his arms the best he can, offers a lasting kiss.
CUT TO:
3. HANK JENNINGS
He slides up next to ERNIE who smiles watching Donna and James.
HANK
You ever in love in the joint, Ern?
Disgusted, Ernie goes back to his paper - the sports pages - trying to avoid Hank
HANK (CONTINUED)
Remember that fourth floor game room? Where the
boys did business? You played along or they tossed you
over the rail. Four floors down to the cement. Guy
landed it sounded like a cannon.
ERNIE
I'm not interested in whatever you're selling, Hank.
HANK
No, you got it backwards. You are interested, Ernie. I
got a piece of something North of the Border, little
gambling, some female company. Full service kind of
place. See, Ernie, the way I figure it, your speciality
being arithmatic -
ERNIE
I have an MBA from Wharton's -

HANK
Excuse me. Here's the deal. I want this operation to
grow. You're a guy who knows how to grease it. I'll need
your help. And a good-sized chunk of Vivian's do-re-
me. Kind of an "Inlaw Thing."
ERNIE
You're confusing "In-law with Inmate."
HANK
Either way we're talking about prison, aren't we?
ERNIE
Our commonality of wrongdoing has nothing to do with
true bonding.
HANK
No, you see it's just like being back in the joint. 'Cause
we got a fourth floor on the outside, too.
Ernie tries to rise, Hank holds him firmly, moves closer, smiles.
HANK (CONTINUED)
Don't make me give you the rail, Ern.
Ernie is chilled by Hank's threat.

4. NORMA AND VIVIAN SMYTHE
Norma watches Ernie move away. Vivian sits in front of an omelette.
NORMA
They are up to something.
VIVIAN
Norma, Norma, Norma ... darling, let the scales fall
from your eyes.
(Norma looks at her)
The men you and I fall for are boys. My legacy to you,
I'm afraid, dear; strutting, adorable juveniles. We wipe
their noses, wash their underwear, tie their shoes -
NORMA
Hank was doing hard time, not juvenile detention.
VIVIAN
That may be. But wherever they find themselves the men
we love spend their life in the dark. And in Ernie's case,

VIVIAN (continued)

Our job is to keep them there.
She takes bite of the omelette. Points to it.
VIVIAN
Oh dear. Whatever fowl did you take these eggs from?
NORMA
Are we saying we don't like it?
VIVIAN
I'm afraid I'm going to hit a thumbtack.
NORMA
(frustration, near exploding)
Can't you say anything nice? Mother, I've tried so hard,
I try so hard and, and nothing's good enough for you; no,
let me correct that, nothing I do, I ever do is good
enough -
VIVIAN
(trying to be light)
The menu's are very presentable -
(sees the hurt)
I'm joking. Honestly, may I suggest something? If you
want to serve a truly memorable omelette, try some
white veal sausage with some morel mushrooms -
NORMA
(taking Vivian's plate and moving off)
Thanks. I'll go pick the mushrooms.

4A. DEPUTY ANDY BRENNAN
Andy sits at the counter, feeling blue, ignoring the pie before him. He mutters a phrase to
himself, as if to test the words, perhaps commit them to memory.
ANDY
(terrible French)
J'ai une...J'ai une ame solitaire...
Big sigh. Somehow it makes Andy feel better. As Donna and James step toward the register,
he repeats, a little more confidentally:

ANDY
J'ai une ame solitaire.
Donna reacts to the familiar phrase with a start.
DONNA
(to Andy)
What did you say?
ANDY
(morose)
Nothing. Hello, Donna and James.
DONNA
(intense)
Tell me what you said.
ANDY
It's French.
DONNA
I know what it is. Tell me.
JAMES
Hey, it's no big deal.
ANDY
(as if to confess)
J'ai une ame solitaire.
DONNA
(sitting at the stool beside him)
How do you know Mrs. Tremond?
ANDY
(now confused)
Mrs. Who?
DONNA
Mrs. Tremond. Her grandson does magic tricks. He
said this to me.
ANDY
But it was Mr. Smith.
DONNA
(now it's her turn to be confused)
Harold ... ?

Andy nods, leans closer to impart a confidence.
ANDY
He left a suicide note. J'ai une, you know. It means I am
a lonely soul.
DONNA
(rising)
I have to find Agent Cooper.
JAMES
Donna, what the hell is going on?
Donna turns for the door. James calls after, frustrated:
JAMES
Donna!

5A. EXT. MRS. TREMOND'S HOUSE - DAY
Donna leads Cooper and Andy up the path to Mrs. Tremond's house, directly across from
Harold Smith's. In mid-speech:
DONNA
Mrs. Tremond is the woman who told me about Harold
Smith. She has a grandson. And he said it to me. The
same words that were in Harold Smith's suicide note ...
COOPER
(ignoring Albert, suggesting a possibility)
Maybe the boy said the same thing to Harold.
DONNA
Harold's world was in words. The suicide note was a
message, it has to be. And it leads back here ...
Donna knocks on Mrs. Tremond's door. A long beat.
DONNA
(as if explain the delay)
She's pretty old. If her grandson isn't here to open it ...
ANDY
(peering toward window)
There's someone inside.

5A. CONTINUED:
Just then: the door opens, revealing a WOMAN. Middle-aged. Pleasant in appearance. And
most decidedly not Mrs. Tremond.
WOMAN
(seeing Truman's badge)
May I help you ... ?
DONNA
(confused)
Is Mrs. Tremond here?
WOMAN
I'm Mrs. Tremond.
DONNA
Maybe it was your mother I spoke to.
TREMOND
(friendly)
My mother passed away three years ago. I live alone.
DONNA
No. I was here. I talked to her. And her grandson, he
was here too.
TREMOND
(confused, quietly apologetic)
But I have no children.
DONNA
But he was here. They were both here...
COOPER
(puts a comforting hand on her shoulder)
Donna, maybe we should go.
TREMOND
(recognizing the name)
Donna? Donna Hayward?
DONNA
(to Tremond)
Yes.
TREMOND
Just a moment ...
Mrs. Tremond goes back inside.

5A. CONTINUED:(2)
DONNA
I've never seen her before in my life.
COOPER
But you said you delivered meals here -
DONNA
I only went inside once. The first time. When the old
woman told me about Harold. I'm supposed to leave
them on the steps ...
Mrs. Tremond returns holding an envelope.
TREMOND
The morning after poor Harold died, I found this with
my mail. I meant to turn it in ...
(holding it up for them to see)
It's for you.
Mrs. Tremond holds the envelope toward Donna. Her name is written there.
DONNA
It's Harold's handwriting.
COOPER
Open it.
She does. Reveals a single page inside.
DONNA
(stunned, fearful)
It's Laura's diary; A page from her diary.
COOPER
(quietly intense)
Read it, Donna.
A long beat. Donna peering at the familiar handwriting. Finally, in a whisper.
DONNA
(reading with sadness, disbelief)
February 21st. Last night I had the strangest dream. I
was in a red room with a small man dressed in red and
an old man, sitting in a chair.
Cooper reacts. He had the same dream. Laura, the midget, forgotten secrets whispered in his
ear.

5A. CONTINUED:(3)
DONNA (CONTINUED)
I tried to talk to him. I wanted to tell him who Bob is
because I thought he could help me. But my words came
out slow and odd. It was so frustrating trying to talk. I
got up and walked over to the old man. Like I was
going to kiss him. Then I leaned over and whispered the
secret in his ear. I told him everything.
(beat)
Somebody has to stop Bob. Bob's only afraid of one
man. He told me once. A man named Mike. I wonder
if this was Mike in my dream. Even if it was only a
dream, I hope he heard me. No one in the real world
would believe me.
Donna completes the page, now turns to the other side. She reads:
DONNA
February 22nd. Tonight is the night that I die.
(quiet gasp, a look at Cooper)
I know I have to because it is the only way to keep Bob
away from me. The only way to tear him out from
inside. I know he wants me. I can feel his fire. But if I
die he can't hurt me anymore.
(Donna begins to weep)
I'm not afraid. I'll miss Donna and James. I'll miss my
home. But I'm tired and Bob won't let me rest. Death
will be like sleeping. I'm almost happy. And best of
all ... I'm free.
Donna looks up at Cooper, tears on her face. Andy's crying too. He puts his arm around her,
comforts her.
COOPER
Laura and I had the same dream. But in her dream I was
Mike.
ANDY
That's ... that's impossible.
COOPER
Yes, it is. Andy, take Donna home. I've got to find
Gerard.
Cooper moves off.

FADE IN:
5C. INT. GREAT NORTHERN HOTEL ROOM - DAY
Cooper enters cautiously. PHILLIP GERARD, wheezing and barely conscious, lies without
bedclothes on a stripped mattress. DOC HAYWARD lays wet compresses on Gerard's
forehead. Cooper moves to Hayward.
DOC
He's completely dehydrated. Breathing getting more
difficult. He needs the drug.
Cooper moves to kneel beside Gerard.
COOPER
"Mike?" Mike, I need to speak to you.
DOC
Any longer could kill him.
A terrifying groan from Gerard.
COOPER
"Mike?"
Gerard opens his eyes, takes Cooper's hand, nods, weakly.
COOPER
There isn't much time. Bob has killed again.
Gerard winces, pained, looks away. Cooper brings him back.
COOPER (CONTINUED)
I'm close to knowing. But the last distance to close is
the most difficult. I need to know something. I need
you to help me.
Gerard nods, grasps his hand, eager to help.
COOPER (CONTINUED)
Bob was in my dream. So was Laura Palmer. So were
you. And Laura dreamt about me the night before she
died. The same dream. I need to go back there and
unlock my dream. The answer is inside.
He leans over him to hear. Gerard struggles with every word. Fighting to stay Mike.
GERARD
Bob is a fire spirit. So are we both, both creatures of

was a perfect relationship; appetite and satisfaction. A
golden circle.
COOPER
(trying to decipher)
A golden circle ...
Gerard gives him the "OK" sign. Which triggers another thought for Cooper.
COOPER (CONTINUED)
A ring. My ring. I gave my ring to someone. The
Giant.
GERARD
He is known to us here.
COOPER
The Giant. Is he real?
GERARD
As real as I am. He can lead you to Bob.
COOPER
How?
GERARD
You have to ask him first.
COOPER
I'm sorry, I don't understand -
GERARD
You have all the clues you need. The answer's not here,
my friend.
(he gently touches Cooper's head)
The answer is here.
He touches Cooper's chest.
COOPER
I don't understand, please -
GERARD
So much responsibility.
Gerard goes slack in his arms. "Mike" is gone. Cooper holds Gerard's limp body. He looks
at Doc.

5D. INT. GREAT NORTHERN HALLWAY - DAY
Cooper exits Gerard's room. He stops to think. Behind him, around the corner comes the
world's oldest ROOM SERVICE WAITER. He's carrying a tray with a glass of milk. He
stops to look at Cooper. Cooper realizes he's being watch and turns.
WAITER
I know about you.
The Waiter winks at him. Cooper looks at him puzzled.
WAITER (CONTINUED)
That milk'll cool down on you, but it's getting warmer now.
The Waiter gives him a thumbs up and moves slowly along.
COOPER
(to himself)
... getting warmer now.
The Waiter turns once, gives him another thumbs up and disappears around the corner.

6. INT. BEN HORNE'S OFFICE - DAY
Sound of DISTANT THUNDER outside. A storm is approaching. Truman and a team of
deputies are methodically searching the room. Truman going through records at the desk.
TRUMAN
(to a deputy)
Box and tag everything in these drawers.
Cooper appears, pauses on the steps by the door.
TRUMAN (CONTINUED)
Coop. We found Horne's phone records.
(Truman moves to him)
Here it is. The night Laura died. The phone call Leland
told us about. Ben called her number from this office.
Cooper spots the STUFFED FOX in the office, walks to it, as if he was the only person in
the room. Examines the fur.
COOPER
White fox.
TRUMAN
White, dead and stuffed.

TRUMAN
Maddy was here. There was a struggle; she grabbed this
thing. Ben killed her in this office, then took her to the
waterfall. He killed Laura and he killed Maddy, too.
Albert stands in the doorway from the inner office. He steps through the deputies to Cooper.
ALBERT
(handing Cooper an envelope)
Madelaine Ferguson died night before last between ten
p.m. and midnight.
TRUMAN
Ben Horne was in custody by midnight.
ALBERT
That's as close as I can cut it.
(hands him an envelope, quietly)
Ben Horne's blood test.
Cooper glances at the information inside, hands paper to Albert. Albert peers at the results.
Then, gradually, hands them to Truman. HOLD ON Truman for a beat. His ambiguous
expression.
ALBERT (CONTINUED)
(Cooper isn't listening)
Cooper?
Cooper turns to Albert and Truman.
COOPER
I'll need you both to do exactly as I say. I have a plan.

Our baby, Lucy.
LUCY

Maybe.
ANDY
Maybe what?
LUCY
Maybe it is our baby. Maybe it isn't.
ANDY
(stunned)
Dick? Oh my Lord. Is he the father?
LUCY
At first I thought you were the father. But then you said
you didn't have any sperms. Then I thought it was Dick.
But now you tell me your sperms are better so as far as I
can tell it's a fifty-fifty proposition.
Andy grabs the phone, begins to dial with grim determination.
LUCY
Andy? What are you doing? Who are you calling?
ANDY
I want to speak with Richard Tremayne, please. Men's
Fashions. Yes, I'll hold.
LUCY
(almost hoping)
You won't hurt him, will you?
Andy flashes a look at Lucy worthy of John Wayne. I'll do what I have to do. Lucy melts just a
little. Andy takes a deep breath.
ANDY
Tremayne? Brennan. Andy Brennan. We need to talk.

That is, if you're not too busy.

Ben Horne aimlessly pitches pennies against his cell wall. A DEPUTY opens the door.
Tojomura steps into view, pauses. Ben smiles as if they were meeting at a Men's Club.
BEN
Tojomura-san. How nice of you to come calling.
TOJOMURA
(to the point)
You are in prison.
BEN
A momentary inconvenience, I assure you.
TOJOMURA
For whom?
Tojomura's sarcasm, however muted, takes Ben by surprise.
BEN
(cautious)
Only myself. Can I help you in any way?
TOJOMURA
(extracts a sheaf of papers from his jacket)
We have papers to sign.
BEN
(getting that sinking feeling)
The Ghostwood contracts. Tojomura-san, I'm afraid
there's been a snag.
TOJOMURA
Snag?
BEN
(squirming)
The usual business disputes, delays. Unforeseen
difficulties, some legal in nature, others ... I'm not able
to sign the Ghostwood agreement at this time.
TOJOMURA
I gave you five million dollars.
BEN
(remembering, sinking deeper)
Your check.
TOJOMURA
Yes. Pen?

BEN
But I cannot sign.
TOJOMURA
Then you will return my money?
BEN
Well, I want to return your money, I want to sign the
contracts for Chrissakes ...
(voice set to quiver with counterfeit emotion)
Tojomura-san, as you can see, I am incarcerated.
Falsely accused. My brother the boy-genius is out
looking for a better lawyer. And until justice is done,
until I am able to breathe the air that free men breathe ...
(he pauses for dramatic effect)
I plead with you for understanding. This is the long
dark night of my soul. A time to seek that tiny
flickering flame within. Business my God, I can hardly
consider it, let alone competently proceed with our
negotiations
(hangs his head, whispers)
Forgive me I've been rather emotional lately ...
Ben pauses. He'd cry if he could force a few measly tears from his ducts. A beat. Faint noise
from outside the cell. And last is a naked foot comes INTO VIEW, placed gently between
the bars, toenails painted a bright cherry red. Ben, head hanging, stares down at them. His
brain reels. He'd know those toes anywhere.
BEN
Ca ... Ca ... Catherine?
Ben looks up, amazed. Tojomura speaks in the VOICE of CATHERINE MARTELL.
CATHERINE/TOJOMURA
(with affection)
Benjamin Home, you're a slimey rat bastard. And I
intend to make whatever remains of your pathetic
existance a living hell. Despite which, I can't help
admiring your style just the tiniest bit ...
(quoting with relish)
"...that tiny flickering flame within."
Overcome, Ben takes Catherine's foot into his hands. As if to caress and kiss it.
BEN
Oh, Catherine. Oh thank God you've come. You're my
only chance. My salvation.

Why, Ben. You're groveling.
BEN
Yes I'm groveling. Dammit, I'm groveling for my life.
Tell Sheriff Truman about the night we spent together.
The night Laura was killed. Do you want me to beg?
Because I will.
CATHERINE
Will you sign over Ghostwood and the mill to me?
BEN
In a heartbeat.
Catherine thrusts the contracts through the bars and smiles. Ben scribbles his signature upon
the contracts. Catherine slips her naked foot back into its shoe.
BEN
Clever disguise, Catherine. Brilliant really. Had me
completely snowed. I have to hand it to you. Signed,
sealed, delivered ...
(hands the contracts back with an unotious smile)
And so you'Il tell the Sheriff ...?
CATHERINE
I'll ... consider it.
Catherine slips the contract into her jacket pocket, steps away. Ben hisses after.
BEN
Catherine! Wait a minute! Catherine!! Wait!
(exasperated)
My God, it's the truth after all!
Catherine pauses at the door, regards him with a wicked smile.
CATHERINE
Why, Ben. We've been lying to each other all our adult
lives. Why let the truth spoil it now?
And with that, Catherine walks away.

Donna stands in the living room, wearing Laura's dark glasses. Leland beams.
LELAND
Donna, I'm so happy you stopped by. We haven't really
had time to sit down and talk in so long, Can I offer
you a glass of lemonade?
DONNA
No, thank you, Mr. Palmer. I only have a minute...
(takes a cassette tape from her pocket)
This is for Maddy. It's a tape of a song we did with
James. I wanted her to have a copy.
LELAND
(taking tape, pages through)
Of course. How sweet of you. Maddy told me all
about that. She said she really enjoyed the experience.
DONNA
Well anyway. If you could mail it to her I'd really
appreciate it.
LELAND
That won't be any trouble at all.
Donna notices Leland staring at her glasses.
DONNA
Is something wrong?
LELAND
No ... those glasses ...
DONNA
They were Laura's. Maddy gave them to me.

Diary? Yes, they took it from her room.
DONNA
Not the one the police took. She kept another diary.
She never even told me about it, did you know?
LELAND
No.
DONNA
She gave it to a man named Harold Smith. He killed
himself three days ago. The police found it in his
apartment.
LELAND
My God. I had no idea.
DONNA
I wish I knew, what was in it, don't you? I think about
her all the time. I must dream about Laura every night.
Just then: the phone RINGS.
LELAND
Excuse me...
Leland moves into the alcove to answer the phone.
LELAND
Hello ... Beth, how are you? ... No, not since yesterday ...
Of course, I put Maddy on the bus myself ... I'm sure
there's a perfectly reasonable explanation ... yes, I'll call
you immediately, within the hour. 'Bye.
Donna has taken tentative steps toward him during the latter. He hangs up and turns to her.

It's the strangest thing. She never made it home.

DONNA
I knew Maddy was expecting us the other night. But I
was selfish. I figured I could see her any time. I mean
Missoula's not that far away ...
LELAND
Donna, you musn't take this to heart. I'm sure she's fine.
(a comforting hand upon her shoulder)
I've got the cure for what ails you. It's simple, really.
But it always improves my mood.
Leland scurries over to the stereo, sets needle to vinyl. An old thirties dance tune is HEARD.
He does a couple of soft shoe steps in Donna's direction. Then ... a KNOCK at the door.
LELAND
Wait right here.
Leland steps off to answer. He opens the door, Sheriff Truman man enters, brushes rain from
his coat. They converse quietly in the alcove. Donna remains out of sight.
LELAND
Harry.
TRUMAN
Leland, we need your help.
LELAND
What is it?
TRUMAN
I'm afraid there's been another murder.
LELAND
Oh my God. Oh my God, that's dreadful.
TRUMAN
Leland, we're closing in on Laura's killer. I can't tell
you why or how but we need your help and we need it
now.
LELAND
Of course. Certainly. Anything. Let me get my coat.

13. EXT. HAYWARD HOUSE - DAY
Doc Hayward works in his yard. He sighs, full of sadness.
DONNA
Dad?
Hayward looks up, sees Donna standing before him. Full of sorrow. And rage. Hayward gets
to his feet. A beat, then:
DONNA
It's Maddy, isn't it? She's dead.
HAYWARD
Let's not talk about it now.
DONNA
(she will not be comforted)
Tell me the truth.
HAYWARD
(pause)
I'm so sorry. Yes, she's...
DONNA
How?
HAYWARD
(as delicately as he can put)
Like Laura.
DONNA
No ... no ...
HAYWARD
Baby ...
Donna shudders with anger, overcome. Her father steps to her, tries to take Donna into his
arms. But Donna rips free from his grasp. She will not be comforted.
DONNA
NO! I am sick and tired of all this pain. Sick in my
heart. Everything good turns to bad. No matter what

15. INT. THE ROADHOUSE -DAY
Truman and Leland walk through the Roadhouse interior. Cooper and Albert are sitting at
the bar. The mood is dreamlike, eerie. And will remain so throughout the following,
punctuated by the sound of the storm outside.
LELAND
Why are we here? Agent Cooper? Is someone meeting
us?
COOPER
Yes.
LELAND
The killer?
COOPER
I don't know. Perhaps.
The main door opens. Big Ed Hurley enters; Ed looks about, a little confused.
ED

COOPER

LELAND
Of course.
ALBERT
(aggresively cheerful)
Only too happy to help.
Cooper hefts a chair, moves it from the center of the room. Ed, Hawk, Albert and Leland
grab chairs, slide them toward the walls. Cooper returns to push at a table.
ED
(aside to Cooper, his real reason for being here)
You need me, just give the word.
Ed gives the Bookhouse Boys sign.
SHELLY JOHNSON wheels LEO JOHNSON into the room. Muttering, Bobby Briggs is
led in by Hawk.
BOBBY
Give yourself a raise, Hawk.
COOPER
Bobby, wheel Leo to the bar and be very, very quiet. Do
you read me?
Bobby sighs, wheels Leo as directed.
Cooper clears the last table to the side. There is now a large open space at the center of the
room. Cooper turns to regard it, checks his watch as if expecting someone else. All eyes are
upon him. Ed and the others watch Cooper with varying degrees of confusion.
The main door OPENS, Truman escorts Ben Horne inside. All turn to view him.
BEN
(a pause, cold)
Hail, hail, the gang's all here.
Truman leads Ben to the others. Cooper turns to address the group.

COOPER
(finishes, turns to the group)
Two days ago, another young woman was murdered by
the indivudual responsible for the death of Laura Palmer.
I have reason to believe the killer is inside this room.
Some react with looks of disbelief - followed by glances at the men next to them. BEN
keeps a cold eye on Cooper.
COOPER (CONTINUED)
As a Federal Agent I spend most of my time seeking
simple answers to difficult questions. In pursuit of
Laura's killer, I have used Bureau guidelines, deductive
technique, Tibetan method, instinct and luck. But now I
find myself in need of something new. Which, for lack
of a better word, we will call magic.
Pause. Cooper looks at the door, at his watch. The suspects stand together, nervous,
uncertain.
BEN
Would you like us to hum? Perhaps some pagan chant ...
Truman and Albert move to Cooper.
ALBERT
(quiet, cheerful)
I think it's going terrifically well, don't you?
TRUMAN
Now what?
COOPER
I'm not completely sure. Someone's missing.
TRUMAN
Who?
ALBERT
Brian, the leprechaun king?
LIGHTNING AND THUNDER. Cooper looks at the suspects. He looks at his watch. He
peers at the large clock above the bar; it strikes three o'clock. Three soft resonant bongs.
A noise from the Roadhouse entrance, the door opens, light pours into the room. Cooper
pivots to see the familiar silhouette of MAJOR BRIGGS. Accompanied by the Room
Service Waiter.
BRIGGS
Excuse us ...

COOPER
(with a small smile of relief)
Major, you're right on time.
BRIGGS
I was on my way home. This kind gentleman flagged
me down, asked if I could drive him here.
Cooper and the Waiter look at each other. The Waiter winks at him. Gives him a thumbs up.
Takes out a pack of gum and extends the pack. Cooper takes out a stick. There's a lightning
bolt on the wrapper. Cooper puts the stick in his mouth. A FLASH OF LIGHTNING.
BEN
(sees the pack)
I know that gum. Thar's the kind I used to chew when I
was a kid. That's my favorite gum in the world.
WAITER
(a big smile)
That gum you like is going to come back in style.
Time stands still.
INTERCUT:
16. COOPER'S DREAM
Cooper is back in a dream. He looks down. On the roadhouse floor, a familiar mound of
dirt appears at his feet. Something gold gleams inside it: Laura's heart necklace. But the
heart is no longer halved, both pieces are joined. The heart shimmers, disappears:
Out of it the fabric of his vision tears, shifts. And Cooper finds himself back in a familiar red
room. The dream first seen in episode #1.002. Cooper sits in the armchair, mute. Laura leans
close to him, smiling. She whispers. But this time Cooper hears and comprehends ...
LAURA
Ben Horne killed me.
A FLASH OF LIGHTNING.
CUT TO:
We're back in the roadhouse. The GIANT appears holding Cooper's ring in the palm of his
hand. In the same brilliant flash of light, the Giant disappears and Cooper's ring falls out of
the air, bounces and rolls to a stop at Cooper's feet. He bends to pick it up. Slips it on his
finger. We MOVE in on him. A long beat. Then, quiet, stern, Cooper turns toward Ben
Horne.
COOPER
Ben, I would like you to accompany me to the Sheriff's
station. You might want to bring Leland with you. As
your attorney.
Cooper nods to Truman. The Sheriff cuffs a stunned Ben Horne and leads him away. Deputy
Hawk steps to Cooper.

HAWK
The quest is over?

Hawk leans to receive his whisper. Hawk walks to the door. Cooper follows at first and then
stops. He looks back towards the stage. He sees the Room Service Waiter wave at him and
smile.

17. EXT. GAZEBO - DAY
James rides up on his bike, hops off as Donna runs to him, hugs him, quietly hysterical.
Evidence recent rain all about them.
JAMES
What is it? What's the matter?
DONNA
Maddy ...
JAMES
What about her?
DONNA
She's dead. It was the killer. The one who killed
Laura. She's dead.
Stunned, he moves away. His legs give way near the shore. Donna watches him helplessly.
JAMES
No ... no ...
DONNA
(unfocused rambling)
I heard Mr. Palmer get a call from her, from her
mother, she said she hadn't gotten home, they came to
talk to him, Sheriff Truman and so I went home, my
father he was so upset he couldn't keep it from me ...
She starts to cry. They can't comfort each other.

You mean us?
JAMES
We can't do this. It's no good.
DONNA
What did we do? What did we do?
Pause.
JAMES
I've got to go. I've got to go.
He starts for his bike.
DONNA
James, don't leave ... it's not our fault!
JAMES
It doesn't matter. Don't you see? Nothing we do
matters. Nothing's ever going to change. It doesn't
matter if we're happy when the rest of the world goes to
hell -
DONNA
Don't leave - James - don't leave me alone!
He gets on his bike and rides. Anguished, Donna turns toward the lake, weeping, stepping
slowly into the water.

In the basement, around the corner from interrogation. Hawk leads Ben towards the door, as
Truman moves ahead to unlock it. Cooper and Leland follow them around the corner.
Truman unlocks the door, swings it open. Hawk grabs Ben from behind, moves him
forcefully into interrogation.
The moment Ben realizes he is locked in, he begins to howl like a caged wolf. Truman slams
the door shut, Hawk locks it.
The howling continues, a rabid sound; Ben, or rather "Bob", careens around the room,
pounding on the walls, searching for an escape that doesn't exist, his incoherent cries echoing
like the tortures of the damned.
Leland stands by, stunned, speechless.
LELAND
(the rest implied)
... Ben? ...
HAWK
(watching through the grill)
That's not Ben.
A gesture from Cooper and Hawk leads Leland back around the corner.

Ben begins to laugh, a low, feral sound, snarling and contemptuous.
TRUMAN (CONTINUED)
Do you understand your rights as we've explained them
to you?
BEN
Of course he does.
(a beat)
I suppose you want to ask him some questions.
COOPER
Did you kill Laura Palmer?
Ben hoots and howls. Then ...
BEN
That's a yes.
COOPER
Did you kill Madeleine Ferguson?
BEN
What do you think?
COOPER
I'm asking you.
BEN

Yeah, well, I guess I sort'a did, kind'a. I have a thing

Ben's been a good vehicle. I've enjoyed the ride. But
he's weak now and riddled with holes. It's nearly time
to shuffle off to Buffalo.
TRUMAN
Does Ben know what you've done?
BEN
Ben's a babe in the woods. With a large hole where his
conscience used to be. And when I go, children, I'll pull
the ripcord and you watch Ben remember. But not for
long ...
He laughs again wildly then stops with a jerk. His eyes close. "Bob" seems to be resting or
waiting. Truman and Cooper look at each other.
TRUMAN
That's good enough for me.
The group exits the room quietly.

There's only one way to handle this. They have a test to

Tremayne looks Andy up and down.
LUCY (CONTINUED)
They won't be doing that test until the baby is born.
During which time I expect complete cooperation from
you two "gentlemen."

TRUMAN
Why? Why did he kill her?
COOPER
Laura wrote about Bob in her diary; Ben found it, ripped
out the pages and she knew he was onto her. Ben placed
that call to Laura from Ben's office the night she died.
He was the Third man outside Jacques' cabin. He took
both girls to the train car. It was his blood we found,
not Ben Horne's.
TRUMAN
Then why kill Maddy?
COOPER
She reminded him of Laura. Maddy was going home,
maybe he couldn't bear to part with her. He wanted to
relive the experience. Or maybe she realized Bob was
the killer and he found out.
TRUMAN
But there can't really be a "Bob." I mean Ben's just
crazy Isn't he?
Truman, Hawk, Cooper and Albert look at each other. Ben's howls fill the air.

With a terrifying, howl Ben/Bob bolts up from his seat and howls at the rain. Then he rushes

his head.
The foursome sprint into the room. Cooper rushes to Ben, wet and still on the ground,
water continuing to fall in this room.

Oh, my God ... Laura ...

I killed her ... oh my God, I killed her ... I didn't

COOPER.

He went inside.

When he was in me, I didn't know ... when he was gone, I
couldn't remember ... he made me do things ... terrible
things ... he wanted life ... he wanted others, others they
could use, the way they used me ...
COOPER
Laura?

Ben is fading. Albert checks him out, looks at Cooper, shakes his head. Cooper turns BEN
gently so that he's lying on his right side, holds him and begins to speak softly in his ear. The
Tibetan Book of the Dead.
COOPER
Ben, the time has come for you to seek the Path. Your
soul has set you face to face before the clear light ... and
now you are about to experience it in its Reality, wherein
all things are like the void and cloudless sky, and the
naked, spotless intellect is like a transparent vaccum,
without circumference or center ...
Ben's face calms. His eyes clear. Albert and Truman watch, electrified.
COOPER (CONTINUED)
At this moment, know yourself and abide in that state ...
(gently places two fin gers on his carotid artery)
Look towards the light, Ben, look towards the light.

TRUMAN
I've lived in these woods all my life. I've heard some
strange things. Seen some too. But this is way off the

COOPER
Is it easier to believe a man would rape and murder his
own daughter? Is that any more comforting?

No.
BRIGGS

it matter what the cause?
COOPER
Yes. Because it's our job to stop it.
