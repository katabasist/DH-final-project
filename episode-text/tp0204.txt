ACT ONE
FADE IN:
1. INT. SHERIFF'S INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY
START CLOSE on LELAND PALMER, his face a dark mask of grief. SHERIFF
TRUMAN'S voice is heard:
TRUMAN'S VOICE
Leland, you have the right to an attorney.
(beat)
Leland ... ?
LELAND
(with a wave of the hand)
No, no. I waive that right. I'm a lawyer ...
VOICE
I'm going to ask you some questions. Anything you say
may be held against you in a court of law. Do you
understand?
LELAND
Yes. Of course.
TRUMAN'S VOICE
(after a beat)
On Friday morning, March third, did you go to
Calhoun Memorial Hospital?
Leland answers quietly, intent, as if commenting on the actions of someone else.
LELAND
Yes
TRUMAN'S VOICE
Why did you go there?
LELAND
I was looking for someone.
TRUMAN'S VOICE
Who were you looking for?
LELAND
The man who killed my daughter.
TRUMAN'S VOICE
Did you know his name?
(CONTINUED)

#2.004
1. CONTINUED:
LELAND
No. Yes. I do now. Jacques Renault.
TRUMAN
What made you think he killed Laura?
LELAND
(steadfast)
You arrested him.
TRUMAN
Leland ... did you kill Jacques Renault?
LELAND
(his eyes shine with unshed tears)
He killed my Laura. The things he did to her... have
you ever experienced ... absolute loss?
COOPER
(gently)
I doubt any of us is a stranger to grief.
LELAND
(looking into his heart)
It's more than grief. So deep inside you, every cell
screams. You hear nothing else.
(beat)
Yes I killed him. Yes, Yes, Yes ...
Leland Palmer breaks down and cries. Truman, Cooper, and DOC HAYWARD arrayed
about the weeping man. HOLD ON this tableau for a beat.
CUT TO:
2. INT. SHERIFF'S STATION HALLWAY - DAY
Cooper and Doc Hayward exit interrogation and walk down a station hallway.
COOPER
He'll plead temporary insanity.
HAYWARD
We'll need a psychiatric exam. I can tell you this.
Parents should not bury their children. Anyone who's
suffered what Leland has ...
(shrugs, lets the implication linger)
(CONTINUED)

#2.004
2. CONTINUED:
COOPER
(gently)
Do you approve of murder, Doctor Hayward?
HAYWARD
No.
But in this case, his tone suggests, he's considered the exception.
CUT TO:
3. INT. SHERIFF'S RECEPTION AREA - DAY
DEPUTY ANDY BRENNAN fidgets in the reception area. Tries hard not to look like he's
waiting for someone. When Doc Hayward and Cooper enter, Andy nearly shouts.
BRENNAN
Hey Doc!
HAYWARD
How are you, Andy?
ANDY
Fine. Great. Fine.
Andy's smile is false. A beat.
HAYWARD
What the problem?
ANDY
(looking left and right)
It's sort of personal.
HAYWARD
I'm your doctor, Andy.
Andy hesitates. This is quite difficult for him. At last, almost in a whisper.
ANDY
It's about my sperms test.
HAYWARD
(prompting)
Yes ...?
ANDY
You know ... I flunked.
(CONTINUED)

#2.004
3. CONTINUED:
HAYWARD
That's not the precise term for it ...
ANDY
Well I was just wonderin' if it's the kind of test you can
take over, you know, like a driver's exam? I mean I've
been wearing boxer shorts every day like you told me -
HAYWARD
You'd like to give it another shot.
ANDY
Yes sir I would.
HAYWARD
Well then I'll need a sample to take with me.
Hayward sifts through his Gladstone, hands Andy a small sample jar. Andy pales.
ANDY
Right now?
HAYWARD
Put it in a brown paper bag. I'll wait in the car.
Doc exits. Andy glances wildly about the reception room. No one's looking. He spots the
box full of "FLESH WORLD" magazines.
CUT TO:
4. INT. SHERIFF'S STATION HALLWAY - DAY
Coming around a corner, Andy and LUCY MORAN nearly collide. She's lugging a
coffeemaker. He's toting a couple of FLESH WORLDS, which he promptly drops. Lucy
spots the pornography, then peers over Andy's shoulder, his destination beyond. The MEN'S
ROOM. Lucy shakes her head sadly and storms off Andy watches her vanish with a wince.
CUT TO:
5. INT. RECEPTION - DAY
Truman and Cooper sit in reception with coffee, taking a breather. Cooper cases himself into
a chair with a grimace, as Truman runs down the day's business.

5. CONTINUED:
TRUMAN
Our judge is scheduled to arrive this afternoon. Clinton
Sternwood. Travels the circuit in a Winnebago.
COOPER
Outdoors enthusiast?
TRUMAN
Last of the frontiersmen. They broke the mold.
COOPER
Bail hearing for Leland. Leo's competency examination.
TRUMAN
That's the agenda. Does Leland get bail?
COOPER
That's up to your state prosecutor.
TRUMAN
Daryl Lodwick. Also on his way.
COOPER
What do we hear from Hawk?
TRUMAN
(off notes)
Called this morning. County says nobody by the name
of 'Robertson' ever lived next to the Palmers. Got a
forwarding address on the last occupants; Kalispell.
He'll check it by afternoon.
(a little disappointed by the paucity of leads)
That's it.
Cooper sips his coffee.
CUT TO:
5A. INT. HALLWAY - DAY
Andy exits the bathroom, holding a small paper bag. He hurries around the corner, bumps
into a coatrack and drops the bag. The bag opens and the sample rolls away down the hall,
coming to rest under a chair in reception. Andy hurries after it, diving past Cooper and
Truman to retrieve it. Cooper sees the bottom of Andy's new boots.
COOPER
Andy, don't move -
(Andy freezes, his hand on the sample)
Andy, where did you get those?

Don't make me say where they came from.
COOPER
Andy -
ANDY
Please, Agent Cooper, this is extremely personal
business.
COOPER
Your shoes.
ANDY
Oh. I'm sorry. Phillip Gerard sold 'em to me
yesterday when he was waiting. Sorry.
COOPER
(pointing out the sole to Truman)
These are the same brand of shoe we found at Leo
Johnson's. The giant said There was a clue out there.
TRUMAN
I thought it was cocaine.
COOPER
Harry, we've got to find Phillip Gerard.
ANDY
Can I go now? Agent Cooper, I don't know how much
time I've got.

BEN
Walk with me and talk.
CLERK
Okay, so this friend of mine works for the Seattle Post
Dispatch, actually my sister went to college with her,
but she's kind of a friend of mine too. Anyway she
called me this morning with a hot tip. Top secret.
M.T. Wentz is coming to Twin Peaks.
BEN
M.T. Wentz ... M.T. Wentz ...

#2.004
7. CONTINUED:
CLERK
M.T. Wentz, the travel writer -
BEN
Yes. M.T. Wentz. The travel writer.
CLERK
Wentz travels incognito, using only cash. No credit
cards, no way to trace his identity. Or hers. No one at
the paper even knows who he or she is.
BEN
(figuring the benefit)
A favorable Wentz review can spell big business.
CLERK
(so excited)
He's coming, he's coming he's coming -
BEN
(interrupting)
Keep an eye on registration. I want hourly updates.
Scrutinize every check-in -
DESK CLERK
Especially if they pay cash.
HORNE
(smiles, checks his watch)
It's not even nine thirty and you've already done a good
day's work.
Ben turns on his heels, walks away without another word.
CUT TO:
8. INT. BEN HORNE'S OFFICE - DAY
Ben enters his office, stops short. JEAN RENAULT sits on his desk, beside a portable
television set, complete with built-in video cassette player.
RENAULT
(quiet, nearly whispered)
Mr. Horne. You look well.
BEN
(taking a closer look)
What can I do for you?
(CONTINUED)

#2.004
8. CONTINUED:
RENAULT
We've met. I sell 'insurance' to small businesses. Like
One-Eyed Jack's.
The mention catches Ben's attention. He closes the door behind him. Steps closer.
BEN
Jean Renault. What's the occasion? Are my premiums
about to be raised?
Renault produces a video tape, inserts it into the television. Presses PLAY. Ben stops
suddenly, pales: Audrey appears on screen, drugged, incoherent. Her wrists visibly bound.
BEN (CONTINUED)
You bastard.
RENAULT
Don't make a mistake, Mr. Horne. I'm just the
messenger.
BEN
For whom?
Renault shakes his index finger. He will dictate the terms of their discussion from this point
on. Renault FREEZE-FRAMES Audrey's image, continues:
RENAULT
There are terms. Would you like to hear them?
BEN
Yes.
RENAULT
They request a large sum of money -
BEN
How much?
RENAULT
I require something else, entirely.
BEN
They should bear the cost of their own middleman -
RENAULT
They can't give me what I want. Would you like to hear
what I want?
(CONTINUED)
9.
#2.004
8. CONTINUED:(2)
BEN
Yes.
RENAULT
Number one your business up there is run by pickpockets
and fools. Every dollar earned, there's a dollar stolen.
Are you aware of that?
BEN
(beat, doesn't want to appear disadvantaged)
I have my suspicions.
RENAULT
What you need is a partner. Who could take care of your
little problem.
BEN
I already have a partner.
RENAULT
Okay. Do you want my help or not?
BEN
Yes. Yes.
RENAULT
One more thing.
Renault presses FAST-FORWARD on his remote. He stops the tape at a familiar image:
Cooper in tuxedo, seated at one of the casino's blackjack tables. Ben reacts to Cooper's image
with surprise, trepidation. What's Cooper doing in his casino?
RENAULT (CONTINUED)
I want this man to deliver the ransom.
BEN
Why? That man's a Federal agent.
RENAULT
Do you want your daughter back?
BEN
Of course, but I can't involve -
RENAULT
(counts on his fingers)
Cash. Partners. FBI man.

8. CONTINUED:(3)
BEN
(he can't help himself)
That's supposed be an equitable exchange?
Jean smiles. He can't help but appreciate Ben's venality under pressure.
RENAULT
This could turn out well. I'll leave the video. It could
help clarify your thinking. Expect a call tomorrow.
Noon.
He exits. A long beat. And Ben steps to his desk, picks up the the phone, punches a button:
BEN
Janet, find Agent Cooper for me, please. It's urgent.

ACT TWO
FADE IN:
9. INT. THE DOUBLE R DINER - DAY
HANK JENNINGS carries two covered Meals On Wheels trays from kitchen to counter.
DONNA HAYWARD waits to receive them.
HANK
You're looking real pretty today, Donna.
DONNA
(neutral)
Thanks.
HANK
(re trays)
Special occasion?
DONNA
Lunch with ... someone I met on my route.
HANK
(cheery)
Bed pans and shut-ins. Who's to meet?
DONNA
You wouldn't understand.
Donna reacts to the slight with muted anger. As if to defend the absent Harold Smith. She
grabs the trays, heads for the door. HANK eyes her figure as she exits. NORMA JENNINGS
hurries into view, interrupts his reverie:
NORMA
Hank, listen to this: Louie called from the Northern.
M.T. Wentz is coming to Twin Peaks.
HANK
Empty who?
NORMA
Only the most powerful restaurant critic in the state. A
good review in a Seattle paper could mean a lot of
business. He's going to try and send him our way.
HANK
(perking up)
What's he look like?
(CONTINUED)
12.
#2.004
9. CONTINUED:
NORMA
Nobody knows. It's a secret I guess. But he thinks he's
arriving today.
HANK
(newly determined, takes off his kitchen apron)
Then we've still got time.
NORM
For what?
HANK
I'll pick up some flowers, maybe some candles and
tableclothes - now what could we put on the menu, some
specials maybe -
NORMA
I've always wanted to do some regional dishes -
HANK
Babe, we're gonna trick this joint out like Christmas in
July.
Hank grabs some cash from the register, gives Norma a kiss, steps toward the door. Norma
smiles, moved by his boyish enthusiasm. It's the man with whom she fell in love.
HANK
Oh, and I think you ought to give Big Ed a call.
NORMA
(not ready for this)
Why?
HANK
(seeming innocence)
You're still friendly, right? So maybe this Wentz fella
stops in for gas, suggest the Double R to any
new faces he sees.
NORMA
(careful)
I'll call him.
13.
#2.004
HANK
Good. You do that.
For just an instant, almost imperceptibly, a chill passes through Hank's voice. Norma and Big
Ed. Hank leavens the latter with a smile, turns and steps out the door.
CUT TO:
10. INT. HAROLD SMITH'S APARTMENT DAY
HAROLD SMITH carefully sets Donna's trays atop a blanket before her. He's turned his
living room into an indoor picnic; silverware and plates, he's even produced a wicker basket.
Donna watches, impressed.
SMITH
(quiet charm)
How many agoraphobics do you know who own a picnic
basket?
DONNA
Not too many, I guess.
Smith sits across from her, cross-legged, with a smile.
SMITH
The food looks delicious. Thank you.
DONNA
I wanted it to be special.
SMITH
It is. Very. What am I thinking? We should have wine.
Smith leaps up, energized, he steps toward a door, opens it to reveal a wine rack inside.
SMITH
Any requests?
DONNA
(quietly admiring)
Don't ask me. All the boys I know drink beer.
SMITH
I'll select something appropriate. The Germans
practically invented picnic wine. Sprechen Sie Deutsch?
DONNA
Parlez vous Francais?
14.
#2.004
SMITH
Of course; you speak a Romance language.
Smith opens the wine with subtle ceremony, pours a little into a glass for Donna to sample.
She looks at him, wonders. He nods, prompts. Donna takes a little sip.
DONNA
Wow.
(more adult)
It's very good. Thanks.
Smith smiles, pours the rest. He holds up his glass.
SMITH
What shall we drink to?
DONNA
(after a beat)
To Laura.
SMITH
To Laura. In our hearts and memories.
They touch glasses. A spark passes between them. Smith reaches toward an end table, grasps
Laura's diary. The one Donna spotted there previously. Donna reacts. Smith looks at her; can
see the eager curiosity in her eyes.
SMITH (CONTINUED)
Her diary. Did I tell you I had this?
DONNA
(masking)
Laura's diary?
SMITH
Would you like me to read? It seems appropriate.
DONNA
Please.
Smith turns through the diary, selects a page. He begins.
SMITH
"But still I'm afraid to tell her of my fantasies and my
nightmares; sometimes she's good at understanding,
other times she just giggles, and I don't have the nerve to
ask why things like that are funny to her."
15.
#2.004
10. CONTINUED:(2)
Donna reacts. She knows exactly to whom Laura is referring. Smith continues:
SMITH (CONTINUED)
"So I feel badly again and shut up about it for a long
time. I love Donna very much, but sometimes I worry
that she wouldn't be around me at tall if she knew what
my insides were like. Black and dark, and soaked with
dreams of big, big men and different ways they might
hold me and take me into their control ..."
Smith reads the latter without emotion, an even odder twist to Laura's musing. Donna
reacts, saddened, embarrassed somehow. She wants Smith to stop and he can see it.
SMITH
Is something wrong?
DONNA
I'm just thinking, I mean, isn't that evidence? Shouldn't
we give it to Sheriff Truman?
SMITH
No.
(less intense)
I've read this from cover to cover, Donna. There are no
solutions here. Besides, she gave it it to me.
DONNA
Why?
SMITH
Safekeeping. Laura knew about my work.
DONNA
(working on him)
I don't know anything about it.
SMITH
(a small smile)
No. You don't.
(beat)
I'm a collector.
Smith rises, steps to a bookshelf.
DONNA
Of what?
(CONTINUED)

#2.004
10. CONTINUED:(3)
SMITH
Lives. People come to me and tell me their stories.
About the world outside. I take their stories and place
them in a ... larger context. A sort of living novel.
DONNA
Who tells you?
SMITH
Friends. Lovers
(beat)
Maybe you will too, someday
Donna shivers. With a quiet thrill, some anticipation. And just a sliver of fear.
CUT TO:
11. INT. BEN HORNE'S OFFICE - DAY
Cooper and Horne look at the small television/VCR on the desktop.
BEN
You were right. Her kidnappers contacted me this
morning. Damn me, but you were right.
COOPER
(reaching for the phone)
I'll call the sheriff -
HORNE
(stopping him)
God no. They'll kill her at the first sign of police
involvement. That's why I called you.
COOPER
That's no reason to circumvent normal channels.
BEN
Normal channels won't bring my daughter back alive.

Cooper stares at the screen with evident emotion. Ben's got him right where he wants him.
BEN (CONTINUED)
(Softly)
You and Audrey have a special relationship. You of all
people understand her value to me. They want to make
the exchange tomorrow. Audrey for one hundred and
twenty-five thousands dollars. Cash. But I must ask you;
will you take it there.
HOLD ON Cooper for a beat. Starring at Audrey, helpless on the video screen.

START ON the kitchen door. Someone turns the knob, kicks it open. A figure steps inside,
face hidden by the absurd number of shopping bags, hatboxes, etc. that they are carrying.
ANOTHER ANGLE reveals s JOSIE PACKARD behind the boxes and bags. She sets the
loot down or the kitchen table. PETE MARTEL enters, sees her.
PETE
Josie.
They enter into a warm embrace.
JOSIE
Oh, Pete. I'm so sorry.
PETE
Me too.
JOSIE
I keep thinking about Andrew. What he would have
done about the fire. Thank goodness Catherine was here
to handle everything.
Pete's face falls. She doesn't know. Josie sees it.

Josie, Catherine died in the fire.
JOSIE

PETE
We're planning a service. They haven't found the body ...
Pete cannot continue. Josie pulls him back into their embrace. This time to heal. Or perhaps
to hide her own delight at Catherine's passing.
JOSIE
Oh, Pete.
PETE
(quietly)
In a couple days, we'll go ahead. I don't know exactly
what we'll bury.
(pulls back, embarrassed by emotions)
JOSIE
I feel so guilty. Shopping in Seattle. Everyone must
have been wondering -
PETE
Harry'd sure liked to hear from you, I know that.
JOSIE
Yes. I'll call him.
PETE
And you got a strange message on the phone yesterday.
Man talked real quiet. Wouldn't give his name.
JOSIE
(alert)
Did you write it down?
PETE
Didn't have to. It was so strange I remembered it. "In
1997 Hong Kong will be returned to the mainland."
What the heck do you suppose that was about?

EMORY BATTIS roughly escorts Audrey into Blackie's office. Jean Renault sits at her desk.
Audrey tries to focus, look at the man before her. But she's weak, barely coherent.
BATTIS
C'mon, Dreamboat, daddy's waiting.
Emory shoves her down into a chair. Renault reacts with a frown.
BATTIS
Miss Home has been a very bad girl. Refusing to take
her medicine.
AUDREY
(faintly)
No more. Please.
Battis scoffs. But Renault surprises him.
RENAULT
Audrey, have you been mistreated?
Battis reacts. What the hell is this? Audrey pauses, then looks hard at Battis.
AUDREY
(the best she can manage)
He hit me.
BATTIS
I did not hit her. If that's what you're thinking. I didn't.
RENAULT
(only to Audrey)
That was wrong. It will never happen again. For as long
as you are with me. Do you understand?
(Audrey manages a nod)
I spoke to your father this morning. You're in no danger.
Everything's going to be fine. You do trust me, don't
you Audrey?
Renault's voice is hypnotically soothing. His concern seems genuine. Audrey feels safe
somehow. Battis steps back to Audrey, sits in a chair beside her. As if to rejoin the team.
BATTIS
You see, Audrey, in a situation like this, people have to
handle themselves in a professional manner. We're all
reasonable people. Something reasonable can be worked
out whenever reasonable people put their minds to it -

HAYWARD
Ed, I just talked with the Saeger-Swenson Clinic in
Seattle. Nadine's problems might be related to
something called pheochromo crytoma; effects the
adrenal gland, it could account for her strength and, uh,
erratic behavior. I'll let you know.
As Doc is hanging up Donna a defiant descent of the stairs, hoping her father will notice
her. Takes out a cigarette and lights it.
HAYWARD
I'd like to talk to you, Donna.
DONNA
I gotta go.
HAYWARD
Meeting James?
DONNA
Writing a book?
Hayward points to a chair and Donna begrudgingly sits.
HAYWARD
You missed two days of school last week. Without an
excuse.
DONNA
I had ... I was busy.
HAYWARD
Donna, we've always been able to talk. If there's
something going on you'd like to share with -

LUCY

Andy and I used to go out.
COOPER
That much I've gathered.
LUCY
For a year and a half until I began to notice things about
him. They weren't big things. They were little things.
He never exercises. He never washes his car, and he
doesn't own a sports coat.
COOPER
Uh-huh, and did you do something about this?
LUCY
After watching a television show, I decided I needed
some "me" time, during which we didn't see each other,
during which period I met Dick Tremayne, Horne's
Department Store, Men's Fashions. He had many coats
and keeps himself and his car in good shape. Most of
his behavior was asinine, but at least he was different.
COOPER
Are you still seeing this Dick?
LUCY
No.
COOPER
Do you want to get back with Andy?

COOPER
I was trying to help.
TRUMAN
It's a nice thought. But it's like trying to fix the potholes
on Highway 9. One heavy rain ...
COOPER
I see. You've been down this road before.
Truman nods. Cooper remembers something, checks the hallway for privacy.
COOPER
Harry, I've got a dangerous situation. I've examined it
from every possible angle. Front to back, top to
bottom. And I believe there is only one way to proceed.
(beat)
I'm asking a favor. Strictly between us.
TRUMAN
What's up?
COOPER
I need one of the Bookhouse Boys. Your best man. It
would be better if you didn't know why.
TRUMAN
I've stayed clear when you asked me to and helped when
you needed it. But Coop, I've got to put my oar in here.

17. INT. DOUBLE R DINER - NIGHT
Norma and Hank are putting finishing touches on a cosmetic overhaul; tablecloths, candles
and flowers in every booth. Hank wears a starched shirt. A nondescript, portly MAN appears
at the diner door, briefcase in hand. Norma calls Hank attention to him.
NORMA
Could be.
HANK
Here we go.

NORMA
Good evening, sir, welcome to the Double R.
MAN
Thanks. Could I get a booth?
NORMA
Right this way, please.
She leads him to a booth, he settles in, she hands him a menu.
NORMA (CONTINUED)
I'll be back to tell you about the specials.
MAN
No need. I want a cheeseburger, medium, a coke and
some fries.
NORMA
(hiding her disappointment)
Very good.
The Man's back is to a PORTLY CUSTOMER in the booth behind him, sloppily and noisily
hoovering a hamburger, using his shirt for a napkin. Hank causally strolls past the Man, picks
up the Portly Customer's plate and takes him by the arm towards the kitchen.
HANK
Why don't we finish up in the kitchen.
Hank ushers him into the kitchen. OFF CAMERA a number of pots and pans crash. Hank
reemerges, meets Norma behind the counter, as Norma puts the order on the service wheel.
NORMA
All he wanted was a cheeseburger.
HANK
Must be some sort of food critic trick.
The Man gets up and comes towards Hank and Norma. They smile nervously.
MAN
Bathroom?
HANK

Hank shows him to the bathroom. On his way back, Hank straightens out some of the little
bouquets in each of the booths making his way to the "critic's" booth. The Man has left his
sports coat on the seat. Hank reaches in and TAKES OUT A WALLET.

Maddy sits and eyes the door. She's nervous. Donna enters, steps toward her. There is much
tension between them.
MADDY
Hi.

Thanks for coming. I didn't know ...
DONNA

Know what?
MADDY
I didn't know if you were mad or not. How mad.
DONNA
I'll survive.
Donna lights a cigarette. Maddy pauses. She's not used to Donna's tough-girl poses.
MADDY
Donna, there's going on between me and James.
DONNA
(calmly)
What if there is? I mean who said James and I couldn't
see other people? I certainly didn't.
MADDY
Are you saying you're seeing someone?
Donna pauses to exhale a little smoke. She eyes Maddy for a moment. Then:
DONNA
Maddy, I need your help.

Donna rises, exits without another word. Maddy sighs, watches her go. Donna steps past
Hank, behind the counter. He seizes a quiet moment to open the wallet. An identification
card inside reads:

Josie models a new negligee. Truman sits stoically.
JOSIE
I know I paid too much for it, but I fell in love with
it ... I heard the salesman say, "The only reason we're still
in business is because Josie Packard buys retail."
TRUMAN
It's nice.
Josie kisses him. Truman doesn't respond. She feels his check and then his hands.
JOSIE
You're so cold.
TRUMAN
Josie, I have to ask you this ... were you really in Seattle?
JOSIE
Yes. Why are you so suspicious? Look at these boxes,
you think I got these at the Cash and Carry?
(it's not selling; changes tactics)
Besides, you know I had to get away. I was afraid.
TRUMAN
Afraid of Catherine.

TRUMAN
I don't know what I think.
JOSIE
You think that I could bum the mill? That I would
deliberately ruin everything of mine?
TRUMAN
There's insurance money.
Pause.
JOSIE
My God ... how could you? How could you think such
terrible things?. How could you hurt me so?
She turns away. Weeps quietly. Truman melts.
TRUMAN
Josie ... Josie?
She turns back. He holds her. It complicates into a kiss, then passion.
JOSIE
I want you... I want you to take me.
They kiss again. Truman starts to lose himself.
TRUMAN
Josie ...
JOSIE
Tear it. Tear it.
She bites his neck. He rips the back of her negligee. She gasps, trembling. He grabs her
violently by the shoulders.

She proves it. Truman slowly loses to his passion.
JOSIE
I want you ... more than my own life.
They kiss, without control. They roll over and over again until they are below a draped
window. The CAMERA MOVES UP the drapes. Behind the blinds in the kitchen, watching
and enjoying is Jonathan, the Asian Man.

Judge Sternwood, hello Your Honor.
STERNWOOD
Lucy, you're a cool drink of water to road-weary eyes.
What is your secret?
LUCY

I'd rather not talk about it sir.
STERNWOOD

Give us a hug.

Life is hard, dear.

Still and all, harder in most places than Twin Peaks.
Truman enters the station.

TRUMAN
Judge Clinton Sternwood, this is Dale Cooper, FBI.
COOPER

Your Honor.
STERNWOOD
How are you, lad?
TRUMAN
You two should have a lot in common.
Lucy hands Sternwood a coffee.
STERNWOOD
Thank you, dear. Harry, break the seal on that bottle of
Irish you've got stashed for me and let's put our feet up.
Sid'll bring in the calender soon as the Winnebago's
tanked up.

Mr. Cooper, how do you find our little corner of the
world?
COOPER
Heaven, sir.
STERNWOOD
This week heaven includes arson, multiple homicides
and an attempt on the life of a federal agent.
COOPER
Heaven's a large and interesting place.
STERNWOOD
Let's hope so, son. Harry, where's that bottle?

Yes. Hong Kong.

That's know-how, all you need, Jon, is a good contact

29. INT. DOUBLE R DINER - NIGHT
The darkened interior of the diner after hours. A doorbell is HEARD. A beat. Hank Jennings
steps into the room wearing sweats, a sleepy expression, turns on an interior light, opens the
front door. Nobody's there. Mutters, turns off the lights, and heads back to bed.
A beat. And the doorbell RINGS a second time. A quiet noise is heard. And appliance
lights, dim illumination, go dark in the shadows.
HANK'S VOICE
What the ...?
Hank Jennings stumbles back into view. He tries the light switch. But this time nothing. The
room remains dark. Hank fumbles through a drawer, produces a flashlight. He turns it on.
Suddenly: the beam reveals Jonathan, the Asian Man. Hank reacts with surprise. He keeps
the beam trained on the Asian Man's face, as if to blind him.
HANK
(cool and calm)
Okay. What's the deal? What do you want?
Hank makes his move. He swings the heavy flashlight at the Asian Man's head. But the Asian
Man dodges the weapon with ease, catches Hank at the elbow, directs him forward, crashing
into tables and chairs. The flashlight rolls on the floor, Hank retrieves it, gets to his feet
and aims a high kick at the Asian Man's head. It's a glancing blow, but enough to knock the
man off-balance.
Hank attacks, the Asian man avoids his rush, sends him flying into a large refrigerator. Hank
gasps, regroups. And charges again. This time the Asian Man plows a fist into his midsection,
adds a blow to the back of Hank's neck. Hank lies still on the floor, huffs and puffs.
HANK
Listen, I'm just gonna ... lie here for a while.
The Asian Man kneels, retrieves the flashlight, aims it at him, steps toward Hank. Silent.
HANK
What? What?
The Asian Man stands over Hank, the flashlight aimed at his eyes. Hank puts up his arms to
defend. But the Asian Man simply grabs him by the hand, brings their thumbs together - a
bloodless approximation of Hank and Josie's partner ritual.
JONATHAN
Bloodbrother. Next time I'll take off your head.
He smashes the flashlight against a counter.
