CUT TO:
2. INT. RONETTE PULASKI'S HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
SHERIFF TRUMAN is turning off the alarm on the INTRAVENOUS feeding monitor,
the pole holding the intravenous bag is lying on the floor, the bag still connected to it. A
screaming RONETTE is being restrained by two NURSES, as DALE COOPER and
ALBERT ROSENFIELD arrive in the doorway.
TRUMAN
Ronette got out of bed a while ago, pulled out her IV -
Cooper moves to her. Albert examines the IV bag. The contents are tinted blue.
ALBERT
Looks like dye.
Cooper takes out a pair of tweezers.
COOPER
Hold her down, Harry. Albert, get your microscope.
Albert opens his case, takes out a FIELD MICROSCOPE. Cooper takes out a pair of
tweezers, lifts Ronette's left hand. Her ring finger is bruised and bloodied under the nail.
COOPER (CONTINUED)
(firmly)
Hold on, Ronette. Hold on.
Cooper goes in with the tweezers. She screams.

3. ALBERT'S MICROSCOPE: A SMALL LETTER
A piece of paper with the letter "B" on it.

TRUMAN
We had a 24 hour guard.
COOPER
Nevertheless, he did this and he tried to taint her IV.
TRUMAN
Maybe her screams scared him away.
ALBERT
Maybe she heard a Sousa March and was looking for her
baton. I'll do a work-up on the IV.
COOPER
It was our man. The letters were never made public.
(turns to face them)
Fellas ... let's stand together for a moment ... it's time I
mentioned something to you I'm not sure ...
but I believe I was visited by a Giant.
(they look at him)
In my room. Twice. He gave me three clues; the first
had to do with Jacques in his body bag and came true
almost immediately. The second was "the owls are not
what they seem," and the third was about a man who
points without chemicals.
They look at him.
ALBERT
Any relation to the dwarf?
TRUMAN
(still processing)
You were visited by a giant?
CUT TO:
4. EXT. HAROLD SMITH'S APARTMENT - DAY 4.
DONNA HAYWARD stands nervously outside the door. From inside we can hear a piano
concerto. Chopin. Before Donna can knock, HAROLD SMITH opens the door. He is
handsome, late 20's, dressed comfortably. Smith seems to be inspecting her in a gentle,
caressing way.
SMITH
You're wearing a different dress than yesterday. A better
color for you.
(extending, a hand)
I've forgotten my manners. I'm Harold Smith.

DONNA
I guess you know who I am.
Smith nods, swings the door open wider. Donna walks into his apartment.
CUT TO:
5. INT. SMITH'S APARTMENT - DAY
The front room of Smith's apartment. Neurotically neat, but comfortable. An interior
window looks in on an inner room, obscured by curtains.
SMITH
Please, sit down. Would you like some lemonade? I
also have a little apple butter and some saltines.
DONNA
No thanks.
Smith sits. She sits across from him.
SMITH
Don't be nervous, Donna.
DONNA
I'm not nervous. I'm curious.
SMITH
Curious about my relationship with Laura.
DONNA
Why did you send me that letter?
SMITH
Laura wanted me to get in touch with you if anything
ever happened to her.
DONNA
Why?
SMITH
She said you would ask a lot of questions.
A Chesire cat smile. Donna decides to slow down.
(CONTINUED)

5. CONTINUED:
DONNA
You don't seem much like a shut in.
SMITH
You mean, politely, what's the matter with me?
DONNA
Okay.
SMITH
I don't like to go outside. I ... can't. Do you have a
judgement about that you'd like to express?
DONNA
No.
Donna notices a piece of paper sticking out from under what appears to be the solid edge of a
bookshelf
SMITH
Laura said you were very fair-minded.
DONNA
If you knew her so well, why didn't she ever mention you
to me?
SMITH
She liked to think of me ... as a mystery in her life.
DONNA
Then why did you call me?
SMITH
I am ... I used to be a horticulturist. I raise orchids.
That's why it's so warm. in here. Laura always admired
them. I wrote you because I wanted to know if you'd be
kind enough to place one of them on her grave.
DONNA
Of course.
SMITH
Excuse me just a moment.
He goes into an adjoining room. The door is heavy, with a substantial lock. Donna rises
quickly, goes to the bookshelf, tugs on the piece of paper. It won't budge. She notices a gap
between the shelf and the wall, moves closer to take a look, then turns abruptly as the heavy
door opens behind her and Smith re-enters, carrying, a beautiful orchid plant. He conceals
any concern about her movements.

SMITH
This is a hybrid; a lady-slipper.
DONNA
It's beautiful.
SMITH
Take it, please.
(she does)
My last gift to Laura.
DONNA
That's very kind of you, Mr. Smith.
SMITH
Harold. Laura was very kind to me.
DONNA
Why don't you like to go outside?
SMITH
(pause, vulnerable)
If I knew the answer to that ...
(looks at her, a sweet, aching look of longing;
then has to look away)
Forgive me ...
DONNA
What?
SMITH
You're every bit as lovely as Laura said you were
DONNA
(intrigued, likes him)
I'll be back.
SMITH
I'll be here.
He smiles. She smiles, exits.

7. INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
Cooper is taping the poster of the LONG HAIRED MAN on to the blackboard. Below the
poster he writes the letters B, R, and T. Truman and Rosenfield watch.
COOPER
R-B-T: I believe these letters and the giant's clues are in
some way connected to the long haired man.
(writes the names in a circle around the poster.)
Mrs. Palmer saw him in a vision. She called this
morning to say Laura's cousin, Maddy Ferguson, has seen
the man twice in the last three days, also in a vision. I
saw him in my dream.
TRUMAN
And Ronnette -
COOPER
- saw him physically in the train car. Four of us have
seen this man in different forms.
(draws a line from one name to another)
The path is a psychic link that will lead us to this man.
TRUMAN
So what did the giant sound like? Kind of a big
booming voice?
COOPER
No. He spoke very softly, directly and distinctly.
ALBERT
And you gave him the beans you were supposed to use to
buy a cow.
COOPER
(grins holds up his hand)
No, I gave him my ring.
Albert deadpans, opens his briefcase on the table and goes to work.
ALBERT
Confining my conclusions to the planet Earth ...

7. CONTINUED:
Albert takes out THREE SMALL PACKETS OF COCAINE.
ALBERT
The cocaine you found in James Hurley's gas tank is a
match to what we found in Jacques' car and at Leo
Johnson's house. Get the picture?
COOPER
I've even got the frame.
ALBERT
The handywork of Leo Johnson, currently appearing at
Calhoun Memorial Hospital as Mr. Potato Head.
(retrieves a FLESHWORLD from his case)
The boots are a CircleBrand rare work boot. The ones
we found haven't been worn or tampered with. The
letter "B" from Ronette's finger was cut from a copy of
Fleshworld. A perfect match. This edition features a
swingers club for double amputees. No comment.
Albert points to the poster of the long-haired man.
ALBERT
We sent the portrait of our long haired man to every
agency from NASA to DEA and came up empty. This
cat is in nobody's data base.
COOPER
A man four of us have seen here in Twin Peaks.
ALBERT
(takes out three crushed bullets)
By the way, you were shot with a Walther PPK. James
Bond's gun.
(he smiles, starts to load up his case)
The trail of who shot you is cold, Coop, but I hoovered
some fibers from the corridor outside your room. My
ticket out of Trolleyville. I'm headed back to the lab.
Albert snaps his briefcase closed.
TRUMAN
Anything we should be working on?

He moves to leave, but Truman blocks his path.
TRUMAN
Albert, you make fun of everyone and everything and
then act like you deserve an award for it. That's just not
right. Get out of here before I do something I won't
regret. Again.
ALBERT
(smiles)
While I will admit to a certain cynicism, the fact of the
matter is I'm merely a naysayer and hatchet man in the
fight against violence. I pride myself in taking a punch
and would gladly take another because I choose to live
my life in the company of Ghandi and King. My
concerns are global. I reject absolutely revenge,
aggression, and retaliation. The foundation of such a
method is love. I love you, Sheriff Truman.
Albert leaves. Truman turns to Cooper. A beat.
COOPER
Albert's path is a strange and difficult one.

9. INT. RECEPTION WAITING AREA - DAY
Albert exits past reception where LUCY MORAN labors over the letters on the scrabble
board in airing area. Cooper exits the room, finds HAWK with JAMES HURLEY,
who's just up from lock-up. Cooper nods to Hawk, Hawk moves off.
COOPER
James, you aren't going to be charged. The cocaine in
your bike did not belong to you -
JAMES
That's what I was trying to tell you -
COOPER
James, I don't want to see you down here again.
JAMES
Yes sir.
COOPER
You're a Bookhouse Boy. You have an obligation to obey

the law. And you have people around you to turn to when
you're in trouble; that's an obligation, too. Stop trying
to figure it all out by yourself. Find somebody to talk
to. Talk to me if you want.
(silence; disappointed and angry)
Go home, James.
James nods and slowly exits. Cooper moves off.
COOPER
How's it going, Lucy?
LUCY
75 words, wait a minute, 76 words ... 77. Oh, oh, that's 78.
COOPER
... going good.
A thumbs up and Cooper's down the corridor. Hawk wanders over to see what Lucy's up to.
LUCY
Agent Cooper has asked me to find as many words as I
can that contain the letters B, T, and R.
HAWK
Let's see, I used to be pretty good at this.
RICHARD TREMAYNE thirties, stuffy, in an ascot and tweed jacket, enters the station. He
stops to look at the poster of the LONG HAIRED MAN, next to a NO SMOKING sign.
LUCY
(downcast)
My lunch date is here.
HAWK
This is the date that made Andy phone in sick?
Lucy nods. Tremayne inserts a cigarette into a holder, turns, sees Lucy, moves to them.
TREMAYNE
Ah, Lucy, there you are.
LUCY
Hello, Dick.
TREMAYNE
(sees the game)
Lucy, I have always considered you a woman of letters.

Tremayne enjoys his own wit, lights up. Hawk looks at Lucy's letters. Makes a suggestion.
HAWK
"Prohibited."
Hawk takes Tremayne's cigarette holder and snaps it in half.
TREMAYNE
(stunned, but chicken)
I say ...
(beat)
I don't believe we've met. Richard Tremayne, Horne's
Department Store, designer men's wear?
HAWK
(still in Tremayne's face)
"Robot."
Hawk goes to the conference room. Tremayne focuses on Lucy.
TREMAYNE
Did I do something to anger him? Not that native
people don't have enough reason to be angry per se -

Let's go to lunch.
TREMAYNE

On their way out, LELAND PALMER hurries in, carrying a rolled-up wanted poster.
PALMER
Lucy, is Agent Cooper here?
LUCY

10. INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
Truman and Cooper are back on the giant. Hawk listens.
TRUMAN
So how tall was he exactly? Did his head hit the ceiling?
COOPER
Almost.
HAWK
I believe they have ten foot ceilings at the Great
Northern.
Leland hurries into the room.
LELAND
I'm sorry I hope I'm not interrupting -
TRUMAN
What is it, Leland?
LELAND
(holds up the poster)
This man. I know him.
COOPER
How?

10. CONTINUED:
LELAND
When I was a boy my Grandfather had a summer house
up at Pearl Lakes, we went there every year -
COOPER
You knew him there.
LELAND
Yes. Now, I know he wasn't a Chalbert. They were our
neighbors on one side. On the other side was a vacant
lot, then there was a white house. That's where he lived.
COOPER
Can you remember a name?
LELAND
I think ... I think it was Robertson.
Cooper looks at the letters on the blackboard, then back at Leland.
COOPER
Robert. Robertson. That's what the letters are spelling,
Hawk, get up to Pearl Lakes, find out who was in that
other house -
TRUMAN
Not many folks up there this time of year.
HAWK
I'll do what I can.
Hawk exits. Leland takes out a match book.
LELAND
Something else. He used to shoot matches at me. He'd
say, "Do you want to play with fire, little boy?"
He takes a match out of the book and puts it into his hand so that as he lights the march it
will shoot out of his hand. He shoots a match that hits the window.
COOPER
That's our man.

11. INT. GREAT NORTHERN LOBBY - DAY
Cooper walks thru the busy lobby heading towards Ben Horn's office. The ASIAN MAN
watches Cooper move thru the Lobby. As Cooper gets closer the man slowly pulls a
newspaper up to cover his face.
From the other direction, BEN HORNE enters, talking on a cellular phone.
BEN
I can't hear you, Jerry, turn the radio down, Jerry ... well,
then go to a room that doesn't have a live orchestra.
(pause, lowering his voice)
Much better. Listen, can you hold off Einer and the boys
till the documents on the mill are executed? Maybe a
twenty four hour troll hunt, a big circle, can you do that
for me, Little Brother? ...
COOPER
(approaching)
Mr. Home?
BEN
Fiske, fiske. Gotta go, Jer.
Ben hangs up. They speak quietly in a corner of the lobby.
COOPER
Sir, have you seen or heard anything from your daughter?
BEN
Not since I spoke to you yesterday.
COOPER
She called me late last night.
BEN
From where?
COOPER
She didn't say. She referenced seeing me in a tuxedo. I
Was wearing a tux here at the hotel the night I was shot.

BEN
Mr. Cooper, as I told you, Audrey's gone missing
before on a semi-regular basis -
COOPER
Mr. Horne, let's speak frankly. Is there trouble at home?
BEN
Do I detect a note of something outside the scope of
professional concern?
COOPER
Audrey and I have struck up an acquaintance.
BEN
Acquaintance. Cooper, here's the best advice you're
going to get all week. Men fall under the spell of
Audrey's charms like ducks in a shooting gallery. It's
not pretty. If you don't want a load of buckshot in your
tailfeathers, park your jalopy outside somebody else's
window.
COOPER
(a slight retreat)
If I've overstepped my bounds, I apologize. I assure
you I'm here with nothing but the best intentions.
BEN
That much is achingly clear and not unappreciated. I'll
leave a lamp in the window and you're my first call
when she comes home to roost.
COOPER
Thank you.
BEN
No, thank you.
Horne moves on. Cooper exits, biting his tongue in self-reproachment. The Asian Man puts
down his newspaper and follows Cooper out of the hotel.

12. INT. ROOM AT ONE-EYED JACKS - DAY
A 52 PICK-UP wraps a rubber tube around the arm of AUDREY HORNE who is gagged and
tied into a chair. EMORY BATTIS operates a video camera focused on Audrey. A black
sheet hangs behind so that it is impossible to tell where she is. BLACKIE O'REILLY tests a
syringe, while watching the video feed on a monitor.
BLACKIE
That's good, Emory. She's ready for her close-up now.
Battis zooms in as Blackie injects Audrey with the syringe, she jerks in her chair. The Pick-up
unties the tube, Audrey fights the drug, then relaxes with a moan.
Blackie moves away. A nervous Battis moves to her, speaks quietly.
BATTIS
We should get rid of her. She knows I sent Laura up
here, she knows her father owns the place -
BLACKIE
With what Ben Home will pay to have his funked-up
little daughter back, I'll buy the bastard out.
BATTIS
Look, I don't want to lose my job.
BLACKIE
(a little laugh)
Honey, if this doesn't work, you'll lose a lot more than
your job.
BATTIS
We can't do this ourselves. Ben Home is dangerous.
She grabs him, holds the syringe to his throat.
BLACKIE
Listen, you spineless gasbag, you're in it, up to your
shiny pate. Stop whining and do what I tell you. We'll
have all the help we need.
He nods. She disposes of the syringe. On the tv Audrey's eyes roll back into her head as the
heroin takes over.

Tremayne wolfes down his meatloaf. Lucy nibbles.
TREMAYNE
- of course, most of the time I keep my department
running like a top, but last Christmas was such a
madhouse, absolutely no time for paper work, I had to
literally invent a system for memorizing customer
orders using mnemonic triggers. For instance you've got
someone looking for argyle socks; that would be file"s"
for sock, subheading "a" for argyle. Now it gets tricky;
a request for a vulcanized macintosh , for instance, is it
heading "r" for raingear or "w" for waterproof? My
familiarity with inventory has me leaning towards "r" -

Richard happily digs into his meatloaf.
TREMAYNE
Lucy, may I ask you something? Do you find it odd
that I don't switch my fork when I eat, that I bring it to
my mouth with my left hand?
LUCY
My mother called it "piling."
TREMAYNE
Actually, it's not odd at all, it's the European way.
He demonstrates and smiles. Pause.
LUCY
It's been six weeks, Dick. You said you were going to
call.
TREMAYNE
I know, I ... lost your number.
LUCY
I work for the Sheriff. You could dial 911.
TREMAYNE
Lucy, I do apologize. I've been so busy, honestly, I've
hardly had time to feed my cat.
LUCY
(anger surfacing)
We went out every Thursday for three months. You made
promises. You said you were going to take me to dinner
at the Space Needle in Seattle. And even though you
took me to Family Night at the Pancake Plantation
instead, I still couldn't help but think it would mean
something special, when in fact the only thing special we

end up on a display bed in Horne's home furnishings. I
admit it was daring and that made it exciting, still I
thought it would lead to more. Like a phone call.
TREMAYNE
Lucy, I feel terrible that you're upset. Really I do. Let
me make it up to you.
(beat)
For starters, I know I promised you a new dress at my
20% employee discount and I am going right back after
lunch to arrange something with Ms. Bolbo in women's
wear. Very special indeed.
LUCY
Oh yeah? How about a maternity dress?
TREMAYNE
Pardon?
LUCY

I am pregnant, Richard. Pregnant.
TREMAYNE
Preggers?

15. INT. DINER BOOTH - DAY
James enters the diner and slides into a booth where MADDY FERGUSON waits. She looks
different; a more attractive dress, and her hair seems softer with more of a sheen.
JAMES
You look great. Cool dress.
MADDY
It's one of Laura's. It was just hanging there in her room.
Funny, I hardly remember putting, it on.
JAMES
It looks good on you. It looks, I don't know ... right.

She blushes. Looks away.
MADDY
Where's Donna?
JAMES
I don't know. She said she'd be here. Maddy, can I ask
you something? Does Donna seem different to you?
MADDY
What do you mean?
JAMES
Like, doesn't her smoking and stuff bother you? Trying
to act, I don't know, tough all of a sudden.
MADDY
James, you know her better than I do -
JAMES
She came to visit when I was in jail and ... I don't know.
MADDY
What?
JAMES
She acted like she wanted to do it with me thru the bars.
She didn't care if anybody saw us. It was weird.
Different. It wasn't like her.
(pause)
I don't know, Maddy. I don't know anything anymore.
Sometimes I feel like I should just take off. Just get on
my bike and ride.
She takes his hand.
MADDY
Running away won't solve anything.
JAMES
Sometimes the only person who seems real in a way I
can trust is you.

Someone real interesting.
JAMES
Those old folks must have some pretty great stories.
DONNA
This was a young man.
JAMES
Oh yeah? What's wrong with him?
DONNA
Hard to say. Other than that he's intelligent and
charming and completely different from any one I
know.
JAMES
What's that supposed to mean?
DONNA
Why don't you sit here and hold hands and try and figure
it out?
Donna leaves quickly. James and Maddy look at each other.

TRUMAN
They're not quite right.
Gerard replaces the work boot and moves to a shiny CREPE SOLED SHOE.
GERARD
Now, if the department does any parading, on the
Fourth, Veteran's day, these are your best bet. Add
some silver trimmed laces, it's an eye-catcher.
TRUMAN
Little outside my budget, Mr. Gerard.
GERARD
I understand completely. You need something practical.
A shoe for all seasons.
Gerard places the shoe on the stack of posters of the LONG HAIRED MAN. He notices
Bob's picture. Truman picks out a sensible work-boor from the rack.
TRUMAN
These are more what I had in mind.
GERARD
Very popular. The lovely thing about ... lovely thing
about ...
The shoe falls our of Gerard's hand. He weaves a bit, obviously faint.
TRUMAN
You all right?
GERARD
I'm sorry, sometimes I get a bit disoriented ...

Thanks for coming down, Shelly -
SHELLY
Sheriff, I'm just going to say this. I know I don't have
to so I'm not going to say anything against Leo.
TRUMAN
We're not asking you to -
SHELLY
He's my husband. I don't have to testify against my
husband.
TRUMAN
You're not testifying, you're just giving us a statement.

Doc Hayward says he's too sick, what difference does it

TRUMAN
Excuse me?
COOPER
You've obviously thought long and hard about this.
Someday, a little luck and top flight medical
attention, you'll have Leo back. The same old Leo,
strong, active ... impulsive ... that you obviously still
love. Maybe then he'll realize what a wonderful person
he married.
TRUMAN AND SHELLY
What?
COOPER
Thanks again, Shelly and best of luck.
He opens the door for her. She exits.
TRUMAN
May I ask?
COOPER
Shelly's an old fashioned girl. Like those people who
like to keep their money at home in a mattress. She
obviously wants to keep her money at home as well.
TRUMAN
The insurance money.
COOPER
Kind of makes you wonder who shot him, doesn't it?
TRUMAN

What two people.

SYRINGE out of an embroidered antique MEDICINE CASE. Trying to hurry an injection,
he drops the syringe. Scrambling for it he accidently kicks it under a stall.
He goes in after the syringe, can't reach it. A shudder hits him. He freezes. He appears to be
undergoing some kind of transformation. The stall door closes. We see his feet kicking, hear
violent sounds from inside. Then silence.
The stall door swings open. Gerard exits. He's changed. His face grimer, set to some
arduous task.
He looks around. Senses something.
GERARD
Bob? I know you're near.
(silence)
I'm after you now.

JEAN RENAULT, tall, lean, hard, sits next to AUDREY HORN, who lies barely awake in
bed. Blackie's younger, tougher sister NANCY O'REILLY sits nearby, holding a covered
tray.
JEAN
Welcome back.
Audrey tries to focus on Jean.
AUDREY
Where am I?
JEAN
Here, I brought you something.
(takes a piece of hard candy from the tray)
Let me do this for you. Open wide.
Jean places the candy on Audrey's tongue. He slowly swirls it around the inside of her
mouth.
JEAN (CONTINUED)
English caramels. Sugar's what you need.
Audrey sucks hungrily on his finger. He pulls the candy out of her mouth.
AUDREY
Please ...
Jean gently strokes her cheek.
JEAN
Go slow, baby. Candy's dandy. Plenty more where that
came from. My name's Jean.
Nancy lifts the cover from the tray. Jean puts the candy back in her mouth, takes a syringe
off the tray.
JEAN
Sweet sleep. Feel the warmth.
He injects her off-camera. She moans, then starts to nod off. Jean and Nancy exchange a
lascivious look.

Blackie and Battis watch a TAPE on one the security screens on her desk; Blackie points out
Cooper on the tape, in his tux, gambling at One Eyed Jack's.
BLACKIE
That's the man.
BATTIS
Oh my God ...
BLACKIE
You know him?
BATTIS
FBI, he's FBI, I saw him at the town meeting after Laura
died, he was up here?
JEAN'S VOICE
I want him.
Jean and Nancy are standing behind them. Blackie stops the tape freezing it on Cooper.
BLACKIE
Jean Renault, Emory. Say something weak and fawning.
BATTIS
Jacques was your b-brother.
BLACKIE
And this is my sister. Nancy.
JEAN
I also had a brother named Bernard. This business cost
me them both.
BLACKIE
I told you we were going to have help.
Jean grabs Battis by the chin.
JEAN
I'm your go-between. The father pays me, my cut is
thirty percent. He never knows who snatched his baby.
And I get the man who took care of my brother. What's
his name?
He presses Battis' nose up against the screen next to Cooper's image.
BATTIS
Cooper.

JEAN
And all you have to do is give him to me.
BATTIS
M-mr. Horne can do that maybe.
NANCY
(pats Battis on the head)
You're going to be a big help, aren't you?
BATTIS
Whatever you want, want me to do.
JEAN
A tape of the girl. Get it now.
BATTIS
Yes, all right.
(Jean shoves Battis towards the door, dismisses
him)
I'd - I'd like to keep my job, at the store. That's
important to me.
JEAN
Go away.
Battis leaves. Blackie and her sister square off. Clearly they hate each other.
BLACKIE
What the hell do you bring her here for?
JEAN
She's with me.
BLACKIE
I can see she's with you.
JEAN
No: she's with me.
BLACKIE
She goes back north or this deal goes south.
NANCY
Jean, tell my sister to behave herself or you'll get mad.
JEAN
She stays. You get the cash. I get Cooper. Everybody's
happy. Of course, we can't let the girl live now, can we?

TRUMAN
You haven't seen Gerard the shoe salesman, have you?

He came in to show me some samples. He got faint and

Colleen walks towards her son unsteadily.
COLLEEN

My fair haired boy?
JAMES
I was at school. It's a school day.

COLLEEN
Kiddo, when the muse calls out, we're helpless to resist.
A poem she said, four days worth. Yes, I replied.
JAMES
Are you okay?
COLLEEN
Myself, I've been better. The poem's pretty good.
She takes out a paper with her poem on it.
COLLEEN
I learned early on. Write it down, escape the humdrum

It's for her own protection Ed. She ripped two pair of

Doc pats Ed on the shoulder and exits.

Nadine, Doc says I should sing a song to you. I'm sorry.
I'm not sure what you'd like to hear.
He takes a long look at her, starts to hum, then sing "On Top of Old Smokey." During the

Eolani, start the tape please.
Mrs. Jacoby hits a tape recorder that plays a tape of waves on the shore. Jacoby hands a

You are standing on a smooth green carpet of grass. Your
ball is fifteen feet from hole. Beyond the green, two
pristine white sandtraps and a lily filled pond yawn out
towards the emerald fairway. A warm whisper of a
breeze moves the flowers on the water ever so slightly.
Jacoby's eyes slowly close.
COOPER (CONTINUED)
The hole seems to slowly drift away across the green
towards the pond, carried by the summer wind. The
green grows larger and larger ... the green engulfs you,
enveloping you in a soft blanket of peace ... you stroke
the ball, it drifts towards the hole and gently drops in
its center ...
Jacoby is under.

Can you hear me, Dr. Jacoby?
JACOBY
Yes.

Raise your right arm.
Jacoby does.

Luau. The guests are all Nigerians.
COOPER
Did anyone else come into the room?
JACOBY
Yes.
COOPER
Can you tell me about it?

The sound of tape ripping wakes me up. I see tape going

Sorry I haven't been out since the funeral. Things are
pretty strange. So, anyway, were you sleeping with this
guy Harold or what?

He seems pretty nice. Kind of an oddball. I guess
anybody can start to seem that way when you look close
enough.
(pause)
We have to talk. Maybe you already know about me and
James, but anyway after you died we kind of got
together. This is not something I feel like I'd have to
explain to you because you probably knew how we felt
before we did. How could you be so smart about stuff
like that and so stupid about so much else?
(pause, quiets emotions, then ...)
I'm mad at you; when it was you and me and James it
kind of worked. Now you're one, I love James and
it's a mess. Your cousin Maddy's here and something's
going on with them maybe and I think I'm going to end
up losing both of you.

I wanted so much to be like you. To have your strength
and your courage, but look what it did, look what it
did to you, Laura

As much as I loved you, Laura, most of the time we

You're dead, but your problems are still hanging around.
