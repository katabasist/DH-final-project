3. INT. TRUMAN'S OFFICE
ANGLE ON MRS. BRIGGS, sitting in a chair facing TRUMAN and COOPER.
MRS. BRIGGS
I don't want to alarm you overly. Garland has
disappeared before. Granted it's always been work
related. Agent Cooper, did this seem work related?
COOPER
M'am, that's very hard to say.
TRUMAN
So Betty you're saying this behavior is part of the way the
Major operates.
MRS. BRIGGS
Let me ask you this: did he leave suddenly?
COOPER
Yes. We were speaking philosophically. Then I left the
site to answer a call of nature. He was gone when I
returned.
MRS. BRIGGS
The fact that you were in the woods is very significant.
TRUMAN
In what way?
MRS. BRIGGS
All I know is he talks about them constantly.
COOPER
In what way?

MRS. BRIGGS
(all she'll offer)
Confidential ways.
TRUMAN
(a look at Cooper)
Betty, I'm afraid there's not much we can do now except
keep an eye out. He can't be considered legally missing
until after 24 hours.
COOPER
Be patient, Mrs. Briggs. Your husband has a renaissance
passion for exploration. That approach creates its own
schedules.
MRS. BRIGGS
That is how he sees himself. There's no manual for it;
there's also no manual for being married to it.
(stands)
Garland left some brief notes on his nightstand. I'll call
you back with them.
TRUMAN
That might be helpful.
She exits.
COOPER
Harry, Major Briggs didn't wander off on some work
assignment. That flash of light I saw signified a power; a
force that lives in those woods.
ANDY BRENNAN and HAWK enter carrying a small white department store box.
ANDY
Sheriff, we found Mr. and Mrs. Milford their wedding
gifts. It's a matching scarf and ascot set.
Andy digs into the white box and pulls out two loud, almost road-kill plaid scarves.
HAWK
Can't believe he's getting married again.
TRUMAN
We should just recycle gifts from the last wedding.
HAWK
(to Cooper)
Dougie's weddings are a seasonal thing. Like the return
of the salmon.

COOPER
Marry in haste, repent in leisure.
The INTERCOM sounds.
INTERCOM (WOMAN)
There's a call for a Dale Crewper ... long distance. Hope
I didn't cut it off.
TRUMAN

Temp.
Truman flips on the speaker phone. A moment passes. GORDON COLE.
COLE (PHONE)
HARRY, COOP? ARE WE THERE? THIS IS
GORDON COLE CALLING FROM BEND,
OREGON.
COOPER
We know, Gordon. How are you?
COLE
COOP, I JUST CALLED TO SAY THAT YOU
HAVE MY FULL SUPPORT IN THIS
INVESTIGATION BUSINESS. THESE ARE
HARD TIMES. WE GET THROUGH THEM.
COOPER
Thanks, Gordon.
COLE
IT RANKS POOR WITH ME, TOO. NOW COOP,
IS ANY OF THIS TRUE? DOUBLE HOMOCIDE?
STOLEN DRUGS? STORMING A
WHOREHOUSE?

COOPER
Who is it? ... WHO'S THE AGENT?
COLE
DENNIS BRYSON.
COOPER
(primarily to Truman)
He's a good man, Harry. No nonsense.
Under which, HAWK enters.
HAWK
Cooper, they're ready for you in the hearing.
COOPER
That's it, Gordon. TIME TO FACE THE MUSIC.
COLE
DON'T LET'EM RATTLE YOU, COOP. THESE
GUYS MAKE A LIVING LOOKING THROUGH
OTHER PEOPLE'S DRAWERS. WE'VE ALL HAD
OUR SOCKS TOSSED AROUND. CATCH YOU

Cole hangs up without fan fare. Cooper returns the receiver. Exchanges a look with Truman.
Wish me luck. CUT TO:
4. INT. CONFERENCE ROOM
Sitting at the conference table is ROGER HARDY. On each side of him are TWO MEN in
slate suits, with eyes as even as colored water. Before Hardy is an open folder, Cooper's
badge, I.D. and gun. Cooper enters, closes the door and sits down. On the table between him
and these three men sit three dark blue fedora hats.
COOPER
Roger.
HARDY
Dale.
A beat. The two underlings sit as still as bookends.
HARDY (CONT'D)
Showtime, Agent Cooper. You've heard the charges.

4. CONTINUED:
HARDY (CONT'D)
What do you wish to present in your defense?
COOPER
I have no defense.
The two operatives look over at Hardy, who stares inquisitively at Cooper. The man on
Hardy's left, whose job it is to record testimony, tentatively takes down this response.
COOPER (CONT'D)
I'm completely confident in the rightness of my actions.
Some of it went down outside bureau stipulations, yes, I
accept that and I'll pay the price. But I'm innocent of
any criminal wrong doing. If they wish to charge me I'll
defend myself in a court of law.
HARDY
(to the man on his left)
Close the book.
(he does so; Hardy to Cooper)
Dale, there's a right way and a wrong way to do this. And
the first thing we expect a bureau man to do is stand up
for himself. A man who can't, who doesn't even try, may
be packing feathers where his spine's supposed to be.
COOPER
Roger, I know the move I'm supposed to make. And I
know the board.
HARDY
(palms turned upward)
So ...
COOPER
I've done a lot of thinking. And I've started to focus out
beyond the end of the board. On a bigger game.
HARDY
(losing patience)
What 'game'?
COOPER
The sound wind makes through the pines. The sentience
of animals. The last thought of a homeless man before he
takes a night's sleep. What we fear in the dark. And
what's beyond the dark.
HARDY
What the hell are you talking about?

COOPER
I'm talking about seeing beyond fear, Roger. About
looking at the world with love.
HARDY
Cooper, you're liable to be extradited for murder and
drug trafficking -
COOPER
That's something I can't control -
HARDY
(hard stare)
Your suspension will continue in force. The next moves
are the Canadian government's and a DEA investigation,
which begins today.
(a slight softening)
You've cracked a big case. You've been under a lot of
pressure. I may recommend a full psychological work-up.
COOPER
(rises, pleasantly)
Thank you for your candor, Roger. So long fellas.
Cooper stands, looks over at his gun, badge and I.D. card, and starts away. ANGLE ON
those objects, still sitting on the table, as we HEAR the door shut.

7. INT. WEIGHT ROOM
Now changed into his wrestling sweats, Mike joins other TEAM MEMBERS gathered around
the weight machines, exchanging a few perfunctory greetings before going over to a seat at the
leg press machine. Hyperventilating in preparation, he looks up at his buddies, who are
looking back at him with curiously broad adolescent grins.
His sudden premonition of dread is answered by the bluejeaned figure dropping down into the
neighboring machine seat; she sets the weight before allowing herself to peek over.
NADINE
Hi, Mike.
(CONTINUED)
7.
7. CONTINUED:
Mike turns his head in dismay. He is both supremely irritated by, and unequipped to deal
with, this bizarre new shadow in his life. The guys are choking back amusement.
MIKE
Hello.
NADINE
(on a roll)
How are you?
MIKE
Just great. Listen, is there something you want?
NADINE
Now, Mike ... aren't we being a little forward?
Nonplussed, Mike starts working the leg extensions. It's all Nadine can do to keep her eyes
off him. With the half-hearted dissemblance of a schoolgirl, she also starts doing leg presses;
but she is doing them with six hundred pounds of weight.
The guys have stopped kidding. The room is virtually silent but for the lifting and pounding
down of weight when the WRESTLING COACH robustly enters.
COACH
Thattaway, Nelson ... I keep telling you guys, it's leg
power that wins matches ....
He then pulls up to a stunned shuffle, seeing the magazine next to Mike's is hoisting double the
weight. Being a coach, he is quick to recover.
COACH (CONTINUED)
And what's your name, little lady?
NADINE
(belle of the weight room)
Nadine Butler.
COACH
Tell me, Nadine ...
(big grin)
... ever give any thought to going out for the wrestling
team?
ANGLE ON Mike: will there be no escape from this girl?

8. EXT. ROADSIDE BAR - DAY
Establish. On a barren stretch of the Interstate. A shoebox along the highwayside, with a sunlit
neon shingle that reads, "The Broken Bones". Parked in the foreground is an old white Corvette
convertible with a weather-worn red interior.
8.
9. INT. ROADSIDE BAR
Dark. Near empty. Clearly a place that lives on night receipts and stray afternoon beers. The
BARTENDER steals a glance over at his only customer, an intent, demure BLONDE in a
purple silk jacket, mid-twenties. A wistful sadness clings to her like perfume.
JAMES HURLEY enters, takes a seat two down and orders a beer. It arrives. The bartender
fades into the background. James takes a long first drink, aware he's being watched.
WOMAN
Hi.
He moves his head a quarter turn, sees her through one eye and looks back into his beer.
JAMES
H'lo.
She kills the rest of a tequila, ice. There's another waiting beside it:
WOMAN
Headed somewhere?
JAMES
I'm sorry?
WOMAN
Is is someplace you're going or running from?
JAMES
You got it all wrong. I'm alright.
WOMAN
Men are always alright. Right up until they pull the
trigger.
The bartender snorts his amusement. Her return look pushes him further into the background.
WOMAN (CONT'D)
Then the neighbors march solemnly out to the news
cameras to tell us, "He was such a nice, quiet guy."
JAMES
I'm only quiet on the outside.
WOMAN
I can almost hear what's inside from here.
He relapses into a characteristic silence; feeling she's been a little harsh on this stranger, her
manner softens.

WOMAN
There was a woman involved.
JAMES
A few of them. Actually.
WOMAN
So you were outnumbered. We don't fight fair.
(ice against glass)
'Live nearby?
JAMES
Twin Peaks.
(meaning her eyes:)
That's a nice jacket.
WOMAN
(dismissingly)
I'm glad you think so. Can you ... do anything with cars?
JAMES
Sure. 'Having problems with that Corvette?
WOMAN
No. While he was away on business, I foolishly took my
husband's Dusenburg out on the road. Someone squeezed
me on the highway, I ran it into a ditch. It would be a
very good idea for me to have the car repaired before my
husband, comes home.
JAMES
I could take a look.
(sips for courage)
My name's James.
WOMAN
Evelyn. Evelyn Marsh.
(sips for pleasure)
I live just up the road.
In the silence, he hears her legs crossing under the bar.
JAMES
We in a hurry?
(she smiles, shakes her head)
Mind if I play the box first?

9. CONTINUED:(2)
EVELYN
(slides him down a quarter)
I don't exactly punch a clock, myself.
James slowly steps over to the jukebox. Something about this offer feels like more than it says
it is. He puts on a slow, soulful song about a wasted, violet life.
As James stands in the jukebox light looking for his next selection, the CAMERA recedes,
leaving them to the music, the dark empty bar, the bartender cleaning glasses.

10. INT. SHERIFF'S STATION RECEPTION - DAY
ANDY BRENNAN is practicing his gun draw, taking aim at a calendar. We hear NOISE
from an entryway. Andy turns, lowered gun still absent-mindedly in hand, to see RICHARD
TREMAYNE entering with 'little brother', NICKY, a wide-eyed vulnerable-looking little
boy. Both are staring at the gun, which Andy holsters then extends a greeting to rival suitor.
ANDY
Good day, Dick.
TREMAYNE
Hello, Andy. This is Little Nicky, my charge from
Happy Helping Hand. Nicky, this is Deputy Andy.
ANDY
How do you do, young fella.
NICKY
Hi.
TREMAYNE
Andrew, old boy, Nicky and I just stopped off at
Horne's for a new wardrobe, we're just on our way for a
malted and we were hoping Lucy could join us.
ANDY
Oh shoot, Dick, Lucy's up at the Great Northern today
helping with the Milford wedding.
TREYMAYNE
Oh God,. that 's right; Dougie's getting married again.
NICKY
Lucy's not here?
TREMAYNE
Yes, unfortunately we'll have to meet Lucy another time.
Nicky realizes his dread: another abandonment. He looks up anxiously.
NICKY
But you, you promised. Where is she?
TREMAYNE
I'm afraid Lucy's very busy right now and doesn't have
time for us.
More resonance. The child begins lightly, silently crying. This is too much for Andy.

ANDY
You know, Dick this is just about my lunch hour ... and if
you'd like, Nicky, I'd sure enjoy taking you two guys out
for a malted. How would that be?
NICKY

Oh boy!
A look of gratitude, mixed with a little suspicion from Treymayne.

10A. INT. TRUMAN'S OFFICE - DAY
Hawk and Truman enter to find Cooper, pouring coffee from a pitcher on Truman's desk.
COOPER
(pouring himself some coffee)
Harry. Nine years ago I joined the bureau because I felt
it was the strongest statement I could make about the man
I wanted to become and the world I wanted to live in.
And now, suddenly all that's brushed aside. I have
absolutely no responsiblities. Nothing to do. And it
feels ...
(laser-eyed delight)
... fantastic.
Cooper sips from his cup. Looks up at Truman with a disbelieving stare; then suddenly spits
coffee halfway across the room. Truman shakes his head in amusement.
TRUMAN
Temp. Lucy's helping out with the Milford wedding.
COOPER
(putting down the cup)
Sorry about that.
TRUMAN
That's alright. We still need to clean up Hawk's.
HAWK
Drain water.

10A. CONTINUED:
TRUMAN
Coop ... what will you do if you can't clear yourself?
COOPER
Harry, last night, Major Briggs planted a seed in my
mind. And it's been germinating. The idea that by
focusing on our fears or desires about something, we give
them tremendous power. Consider this, Harry: perhaps
by our best-intentioned resistance of evil, we somehow
unknowingly join hands with it. Perpetuate it.
(he has lost the sheriff)
And now, being suspended, I'm suddenly empowered to
let go of my preoccupation with wrongdoing. I feel like
I've been exiled back to the natural rhythms of life.
TRUMAN
Well, if you ever come to feel you need a home base,
there'll always be a job for you here in Twin Peaks.
COOPER
(with emphatic gratitude)
Harry, in a world of continuing disorder, you are a rock.
Oh, Mrs. Briggs called. The notes beside Major Briggs's
bed? A rather detailed grocery list and a small
endearment. Nothing more.
(his eyes light up)
Hawk, Harry have either of you ever heard of a place
called the White Lodge.
TRUMAN
Can't say that I have.
Hawk's initial reply is a look of concern.
HAWK
Where did you hear of it?
COOPER
It was the last thing Major Briggs mentioned before he
disappeared. You know of it?
HAWK
(a cautious look at Harry)
Cooper, you may be fearless in this world. But there are
other worlds.
COOPER
Tell me more.
(CONTINUED)
#2.011 Revised 10-23-90, PINK

10A. CONTINUED:(2)
HAWK
Local legend. The White Lodge is a place where the
spirits that rule man and nature here reside.
COOPER
That's a place I'd like to see.
HAWK
Many have tried. They say it exists only on the spiritual
plane.
TRUMAN
(sitting; here we go again)
Maybe I'd better pull up a chair.
HAWK
There is also a legend of a place called The Black Lodge:
the shadow self of the White Lodge, a place of dark
forces that pull on this world. A world of nightmares:
shamans reduced to crying children; angry spirits pouring
from the woods; graves opening like flowers.
COOPER
Dangerous.
HAWK
The legend says every spirit must pass through there on
the path to perfection. There you will meet your own
shadow self. My people call it the Dweller on the
Threshold. But it is said that if you confront the Black
Lodge with imperfect courage, it will utterly annihilate
your soul.
COOPER
Holy Smokes.
Just then: an intercom BUZZ. The temp's vaguely confused VOICE is heard:
TEMP'S VOICE
Agent Crewper? Agent Bryson here to see you.
COOPER
(to Hawk and Truman)
Dennis and I worked together in Oakland a couple years
back. Broke a smuggling ring. One of the finest minds in
the DEA, Harry. We're in good hands.

A KNOCK is heard. All turn toward the door.
MAN (O.S.)
Coop?
They look up: leaning fetchingly against the doorframe is a thin MAN in an Ann Taylor suit.
Long skirt. Light makeup.
COOPER
... Dennis?
MAN IN DRESS
It's a long story, but I prefer Denise if you don't mind.
COOPER
Okay. This is Sheriff Truman. Deputy Hawk.
DENISE
Pleased. Denise Bryson, Drug Enforcement Agency.
Oblivious to the stares, Bryson sits and opens his briefcase. He is clearly business first.
DENISE (CONT'D)
Nice ride out here ... hard to believe you even have any
crime, Sheriff, I picture you chasing lost dogs, locking
up the town drunk ...
TRUMAN
It's a little more involved.
DENISE
Let's move right through this, Dale. The DEA's interest
stems from allegations made by an RCMP officer that
you stole drugs being used by him in a sting operation.
COOPER
Patently untrue: Denise, I believe I'm being set up.
DENISE
My recent experience has taught me never to judge too
quickly.
(closes briefcase)
I'll get right to work on this and be back to you later
today. I understand we're both staying at the Great

Let's catch up later. I want to tell you all about my new
life.

Pleasure to meet you, Sheriff. Deputy.
Denise goes. Cooper, Truman and Hawk. A long beat.

Are you like, still going out with, you know, Mike or
anything?
DONNA
No.
NADINE
(quiet exaltation)
Oh, yea.
DONNA
Why?
NADINE
You have to promise to say anything, promise, okay?
(Donna nods)
I think there may be some major chemistry developing ...
omi God, there he is.
Mike approaches, Nadine hurries to him, girlishly leans into his path.
NADINE
Hi, Mike. Guess who's thinking about going out for the
wrestling team?
Donna looks over at Mike; this can't be true. Wrestling? Mike shrugs back in the affirmative.
NADINE (CONT'D)
I promise to take it easy on you in practice.
Mike, who's had enough, smiles acidly and moves on. Nadine watches hungrily.
NADINE (CONT'D)
Look at those buns. Cowabunga.
DONNA
Nadine ... what about Ed?

Aren't you ... still seeing him?

Yeah, sorta.

Ed's at home. Mike's at school. Ed stays in. Mike likes

he's old enough to be my father. Catch you later.
That one loses Donna completely. Nadine scampers off.

12. INT. TRUMAN'S CABIN - AFTERNOON
JOSIE'S sitting up in bed, finishing her lunch. Truman sits at her bedside.
TRUMAN
All right. It's time you tell me where you've been and
what you've been through. I have to know the truth. I
can't go on doing this, being with you unless I know.
JOSIE
(stroking his face)
Harry ...
He takes her hand gently but firmly away from his face.
TRUMAN
The truth.
JOSIE
(pause, completely different tone)
I used to work for a man in Hong Kong. His name is
Thomas Eckhardt. He ... helped me. He took me off the
streets when I was sixteen. If you're from a poor family,
sometimes they ... sell the female children. I was lucky.
Truman struggles to keep his emotional resolve.
JOSIE (CONT'D)
He taught me about life and he taught me about business.
He was my father. My master. My lover. I never
questioned him or anything he did. Then a day came
when I learned too much. He had a man killed, a business
partner who had wronged him. Murdered. I saw it done.
TRUMAN
Did you go to the police?
(CONTINUED)
19.
12. CONTINUED:
JOSIE
He owns the police. When I met Andrew Packard I was
already afraid for my life. Andrew was also a business
partner. He was good and kind, and when he asked me to
marry him, I said yes, to come with him, and to get away
from Eckhardt.
TRUMAN
Who was this Mr. Lee? Your "cousin?"
JOSIE
Harry, I'm sorry. I was trying to keep you out of this.
The less you know the better -
TRUMAN
Who was he?
JOSIE
That man works for Eckhardt. And he said if I didn't go
back with him he would kill you.
TRUMAN
Why?
JOSIE
Because Eckhardt wants me. He's never stopped wanting
me. He think I'm his property. When Andrew was alive
he could protect me. I now believe Eckhardt is the man
responsible for Andrew's death.
(pauses, makes sure Truman's buying - he is)
Jonathan was driving me to the airport in Seattle. I
jumped out of the car. I'd rather die. I'd rather die than
go back to that monster ...
TRUMAN
Josie, stop. You're here with me.
JOSIE
(tearing up)
Now he'll kill both of us.
Truman takes her in his arms. Quiet. Determined.
TRUMAN
Let him try.

Andy, Tremayne, and Little Nicky sit together at the counter. Nicky seated angelically,
between them. Norma enters, pours a refill, spots a new customer seated nearby. Roger
Hardy looks up from his newspaper.
NORMA
May I help you?
HARDY
(business-like as usual)
I'd like a cup of coffee, please. And some of that pie I
keep hearing about.
NORMA
(friendly)
Coming up. You won't be disappointed.
Norma turns to go. But familiar voices catch her attention. HANK and ERNIE enter,
singing a hunting song, spirited and sleepless from the expedition. Ernie looks far the more
worn; he as clearly had his clock cleaned by a thorough professional.
HANK
Hello, sunshine. Can we get some coffee?
Hank drifts toward the back, Ernie drops onto a counter seat, where Norma immediately
draws him some coffee. Ernie trombones into a handkefchief.
NORMA
How was the hunting expedition? Catch anything?
HANK
(sotto voce)
Hope not.
ERNIE
Catch anything? I came across a twelve-point buck
standing by a deepwater stream; looked me right in the
eye, wouldn't budge. Almost like he was toying with
me. I made a soft approach, lined him up dead center
and...
("shoots")
A steady eye. A steady hand. That's the secret.

ERNIE
Vivian's gone back to Seattle.
HANK
Better for you, buckeroo. You've got four kilos to unload,
you don't want the ball and chain getting in the way, do you?
ERNIE
I suppose not.
HANK
Better hit the phones, Hot Rod. We're on a deadline.
Ernie starts unenthusiastically toward the pay phone; Hank heads back to the kitchen. PICK
UP Norma as she delivers their orders to little Nicky, Andy and Treymayne.
NORMA
Two coffees, two pieces of three-berry pie ...
NICKY
How much does that cost?
TREMAYNE

I'm sure I don't know. And one super snow-frosted Twin
Peaks DoubleR chocolate malted.
ANDY

Looks just like White Tail Mountain, doesn't it Nicky?
With a sudden burst from his little lungs, Nicky blows fiercely at the cream, causing it to fly
up into Andy's face. Tremayne laughs like a hyena. Andy fumbles for some napkins.
NICKY
Sorry, Uncle Andy.
Andy smiles. Uncle. Who could not love this kid?

don't want to filthy up that stylish little shirt.
Tremayne reaches across Nicky to the napkin dispenser. Nicky begins rolling the base of his
malted along its circumference, like a tiring spun coin, then accidentally lets it drop forward,
spilling his malted all over the extended left arm of Tremayne's natty, expensive sport coat.
TREMAYNE (CONTINUED)
Damn it! Damn it!
Nicky immediately begins to cry.
TREYMAYNE (CONTINUED)
(recovering)
That's okay. It's fine, Nicky. It's completely all right.
Tremayne reaches over the counter for some more serious cleanup materials. Andy leans away
from the chocolate spreading over the counter to lunge for some napkins. Little Nicky, with
slightly unexpected strength gives Andy's stool a mighty spin. Still facing away from them
as he cleans himself off, Andy lowers himself back onto the edge of his seat, hits the spinning
stool and flies directly to the floor. Norma and Tremayne look up from their mopwork.
CLOSE ON Nicky, his cherubic face still streaked with whipped cream, the slight upward
curve of his lips suggesting a tiny, unsettling smile.

He's that way about everything he owns.

I could have learned something from that; if I'd been
paying attention.

EVELYN
Where do you want to go?
JAMES

It's not a place. It's a feeling.

Sometimes riding at night, I punch off my headlight, turn

EVELYN

So ... think you can fix it?
JAMES
Sure.
EVELYN
There's a room above the garage. You can stay there while
you work. If you like. Room and board. Whatever else

17. INT. BEN HORNE'S OFFICE - DAY
START CLOSE on a projector screen surrounded by darkness. Flickering before us is silent
footage of Ben as a young boy, eagerly witnessing a groundbreaking ceremony. Images of
young Ben, Jerry, their bearded FATHER, dance across the screen. Horne Sr. shoves a spade
into the ground, unearths the ceremonial soil. All clap and celebrate. Smiles abound. In a
background a large sign proclaims: FUTURE SITE OF THE GREAT NORTHERN HOTEL.
It's a sentimental journey back to a simpler time and place.
PULL BACK from the screen into the darkened office, shades drawn, to Ben, seated in the
screen's reflected light watching his old glory days, sipping from a crystal glass, a nearly
empty bourbon bottle beside him, cigar smoke snaking up through the projector's beam. Then,
quietly at first, eyes fixed upon the screen ... Ben recites:
BEN
"Now is the winter of our discontent/Made glorious
summer by this sun of York; And in all the clouds that
lour'd upon our house/In the deep bosom of the ocean
buried./Now are our brows bound with victorious
wreaths; Our bruised arms hung up for monuments; Our
stern alarums changed to merry meetings; Our dreadful
marches to delightful measures."
A door opens. The silhouette in the doorway causes Ben to immediately douse the projector
and turn on his desk lamp. On the desk are a box of kleenex and several silver gravity toys.
Hank enters.
HANK
A stag party. And I wasn't even invited.
BEN
Hank, where have you been?
HANK
Ben, I have had an absolutely killer schedule.
BEN
Do you know what kind of hell I've been through the last
few days? You said you took care of Catherine in the
mill fire: she's alive. And as you might imagine, not
happy about it. Through extortion and trickery, she's now
managed to cheat me out of both Ghostwood and the
mill. And then there's the small matter of my being
arrested for killing Laura Palmer, a real business-
enhancer, on top of which my trusted solicitor, the late
Leland Palmer turns out to a homocidal lunatic!

BEN

Do you think the furniture in this room is arranged
adequately? I've been toying with the notion that if one
could find the proper spatial relationship between all the
objects in a given space, it could create a resonance the
benefits of which to the individual dwelling in that space
could be extensive and far reaching. Help me move this
desk, would you?
Ben asks for a hand with the desk.
HANK
That's fascinating, Ben, really, listen, though, what we
have to do now is talk about One-Eyed Jacks.
BEN
Jacks, yes, One-Eyed Jacks, uh-huh.
HANK
Here's how it is, Ben. Ben, you're out.
BEN
Excuse me? I own One-Eyed Jack's.
HANK
There's been a friendly takeover.
BEN
You walk in here under my employ and have the gall -
HANK
Oh, that's another thing. I don't work for you anymore.
BEN

Renault. Jean Renault. It's Renault, isn't it?

Hank steps forward and gives Ben a long look. A Hank special. The room's power shifts.
HANK
Look at you. You're a mess. You screwed up, boss man.
You're out, Ben.
Hank exits. Ben glares at the door, then glances over at the burbon bottle. The blank
projector screen, the hum of the projector. He pours himself a drink, slouches back in the chair,
bathed in the light of the projector. A beat. Ben manages a bizarre smile and makes shadow
puppets on the wall. Little dancing rabbits for his own amusement

Of course you couldn't help but take note of my

predeliction for the tidy and fastidious. See how my
response to you begins to lead us towards a classical
confrontation? But there's doubt in your mind: what are
my true intentions? How will you answer this time?
Hobgoblins, Dale; consistency, predictibility, giving rise
to patterns. We both know only too well how these
patterns leave you vulnerable to attack. You with your
wounds. I with mine. Let me paint you a picture. My
knights will skirmish. Lanes of power and influence will
open to my bishops and rooks. Pawns will naturally be

19. INT. GREAT NORTHERN DINING ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON
Before the fireplace, the wedding ceremony of DOUGIE and LANA BUDDING is in
progress. Steady and easy, Dougie stands in a herringbone sports jacket and evergreen slacks.
Lana, her full body alight with flows of white and pink chiffon, looks something like an
exploding birthday cake.
The REVEREND performs the ceremony with a respectful air, seemingly dissembling his
own skepticism. The best man is PETE MARTELL; the maid of honor AUDREY HORNE.
Beyond them is a half-moon gallery seated in Great Northern dining chairs, with no separation
based on family (hers is not there). Some of those seated are Truman, Andy, Hawk, LOG
LADY, and a disgusted DWAYNE MILFORD, patting the hand of an older, blue-haired
WOMAN. Her stone-face suggests she is less than thrilled with the ongoing nuptials.
REVEREND
Do you, Douglas Milford, take this woman to be your
wife, to love and cherish, for as long as you both shall live.
DOUGIE
You bet, Reverend.
REVEREND
And do you, Lana Budding, take this man to be your
husband, to love honor and obey, so long as you both shall
live?
LANA
I do, your Honor.
REVEREND
If there be anyone here who knows not why this union
should be made, let him speak now or forever hold his -
DWAYNE

You're damned straight I object - that little
golddigger's after his money, his publishing empire, and
God knows what else - look at him, he's already got one

Truman and Hawk quickly hustle Dwayne off into the background.

Cooper stands at his window, tape machine in hand.
COOPER
Diane, I am standing at the window of my room at the
Great Northern, looking down at the wedding of Dougie
Milford and his youthful bride. The ceremony appears
quite simple; the groom, commencing his fifth marriage,
has apparently honed the procedure down to the bone.
The reception will be starting shortly and a good deal of
alcohol will undoubtedly be consumed in order to
accomodate our culturally prevelant rally discomfort with
mystery and ritual.
(turns from window, sets down recorder, begins
to dress, speaks while peering in mirror)
Diane, I anticipate your question. I am not down among
the revelers because my mind is burdened with questions:
what's become of Major Briggs? What is the true
significance of the White and Black Lodge? Has the
Major, clearly a man of no small spiritual advancement,
perhaps been attempting to make contact with some
element of these places in his top-secret work? Briggs is a
man of clear eye and deep thought; he sees right through
the illusory texture of this world and fluently reads
beneath it. You might meet a handful like him in a
lifetime. But if what Hawk has related to me about the
Black Lodge is true, even a man of Briggs' considerable
fortitude would be tested to his ultimate limits.
(sits down on the bed)
In an even darker corner of my thoughts is my old partner,
Windom Earle, the man who, prior to his utter mental
and emotional collapse, burned with a brilliance I doubt
I will ever see the equal of. Add to that the things I've
witnessed here at Twin Peaks: the tremendous evil forces
that linger on the periphery of this genuine, spirited little
town. The darkness Laura Palmer submitted to. The

Could I have another daquiri please?
COOPER
Dennis, if you don't mind my asking, what the hell
happened to you?
DENISE
Not at all. It's good to talk about it. It's simple,
really. Last year I was working undercover on a suburban
surveillance, some Bolivians were moving coke out of a
house across the street ... the seller had a few kinks, his rep
was he'd only sell to transvestites. So my partner and I
shacked up. I played the buyer and I found that wearing
women's clothes ... relaxed me. I continued wearing them
into the night. My partner thought it was my consummate
professionalism. It was a very confusing two weeks.
COOPER
To say the least.
DENISE
So one thing led to another and I'm currently into a
specialized kind of program called Gender Relocation
Inhibition Therapy, or G.R.I.T. Part of my treatment is
to dress the part for six months prior to any further
therapy; hormones, electrolysis -
COOPER

This is all a pretty astounding disclosure, Denise.

Music turned out pretty good.
DWAYNE

Across the room, Lana holds the ceremonial bouquet before a host of eager women. She flings
it up into a looping flight, from where it's suddenly snatched by an agile Denise. There's some
surly mumbling amongst the other girls about the bouquet-snagging by this ringer. Denise
sashays back to the bar, where Truman has now joined Cooper.
DENISE
Unfair advantage. How many of those girls were Varsity
wide receivers?
TRUMAN
Hope those two go up to the honeymoon suite soon. We've
had to separate Dwayne and Dougie twice. Happens
every wedding. My theory is Dwayne's jealous.
The ensemble music kicks up again. Denise looks a little wistful. Lana and Dougie swing by

Eight years ago, Andrew got the better of Eckhardt in a
