ACT ONE
FADE IN:
1. INT. OWL CAVE - DAY
OPEN ON the interior of Owl Cave, dark and silent. Suddenly: VOICES coming closer.
COOPER, TRUMAN, etc.
This way... careful Andy...
Flashlight beams illuminate the scene. AGENT COOPER, SHERIFF TRUMAN,
DEPUTY HAWK and DEPUTY ANDY enter. Cooper and Truman carry flashlights,
backpacks filled with excavation equipment. Hawk holds a bright lantern. Andy is armed
with sketch pad, pencils. All pause, turn toward the cave symbol. Cooper reacts with a curse.
COOPER
Dammit.
The painting has been tampered with, ten dowels, with obscure symbols attached, now extend
from it, seemingly abstract, without obvious intent or meaning.
TRUMAN
But who...?
Hawk kneels at the base of the painting, casts lantern light upon the cave floor. He's examining
fresh tracks left in the dirt. Cooper steps toward him.
HAWK
I saw the same tracks outside the power station. Weight
shift to the left foot. A break in the heel.
COOPER
Windom Earle.
TRUMAN
What would Earle be doing here?
COOPER
That's a frightening question to contemplate.
(turns to face the others)
Andy. I need an accurate, large scale rendering of this
painting. Harry, we need to speak to Major Briggs
immediately.
TRUMAN
(mystified, but supportive)
Whatever you say, Coop. I'll call from the jeep.
Cooper nods assent. Truman exits. Hawk steps to Andy, casts additional light upon the
painting as the deputy draws and copies. Copper pivots, gazes at the mysterious image. As if
to wonder where it might lead him.

2. INT. WINDOM EARLE'S CABIN - DAY
START CLOSE on WINDOM EARLE. Seated in an armchair, pipe in hand, avuncular in
aspect, he begins:
EARLE
Once upon a time, there was a place of great goodness
called the White Lodge. Fawns gamboled there amidst
happy laughing spirits. The sounds of innocence and
laughter filled the air. When it rained it rained sweet
nectar that paralyzed the heart with the desire to live
one's life in truth and beauty.
(beat)
Generally speaking, a ghastly place reeking of virtue's
sour smell, engorged with the whispered prayers of
kneeling mothers, mewling newborns, and fools young
and old compelled to do good without reason. But, I
am pleased to note, our story does not end in this place
of saccharine excess.
As he speaks, CAMERA PANS from Earle, travels toward his unseen audience, revealing
LEO JOHNSON seated cross-legged on the floor, as if listening to a bedtime story.
EARLE
For there is another place, its opposite, of almost
unimaginable power, chock full of dark forces and
vicious secrets. No prayers dare penetrate this frightful
maw. Spirits there care not for good deeds and priestly
invocations. They are as like to rip the muscle from
our bones as greet you with a happy g'day. And, if
harnessed, these spirits, this hidden land of unmuffled
screams and broken hearts, will offer up a power so vast
that its bearer might reorder the earth itself to his liking.
(beat)
This place I speak of, is known as the Black Lodge. And
I intend to find it.
CAMERA CONTINUES to PAN, reveals a dull-witted YOUTH seated at Leo's school
desk. Long stringy hair, head band, a vacant stare. Some sullen refugee from a speed metal
talent show.
YOUTH
Listen, man. The story's cool. But you promised me
beer. Besides, you told me there was gonna be a party up
here. Black Lodge, White Lodge, like what's the big
deal?
CAMERA CONCLUDES its move, HOLDS ON Earle's computer screen, where we see a
computer rendering of the hieroglyph from Owl Cave.

PETE MARTELL sits at his chess board, peering silently at the pieces, morose, mournful.
PETE
(nearly whispered)
I think I shall never see, a girl as lovely as Josie...
(pauses, starts again; he's composing a poem)
When she walked into the flowers stood up
and...
(seeking rhyme)
Room... doom... fume... gloom...
(beat)
I think I shall never see, a girl as lovely as Josie, when she
walked into the room, the flowers were all abloom...
(tearing up)
Oh Josie...
Pete's poetic reverie is interrupted when CATHERINE MARTELL storms into the room.
She's carrying the mysterious black box Eckhardt gave her.
CATHERINE
Pete! Stop your incessant moping and give me a hand
with this damn box.
PETE
What exactly do you want me to do?
CATHERINE
Open it. I've been trying all morning. Thomas
Eckhardt left this box to me when he died. I want it
opened and I want it opened now.
PETE
(taking box into his hands)
Well ... let's take a look-see... do you have a key?
CATHERINE
If I had a key, it would be be open already, don't you
think?

PETE
'Course there's no key hole...
(he plays with the sides and edges of the box,
pieces that interact as if part of a larger puzzle)
It's a puzzle box. Saw one of these at a crafts emporium
in Guam. I was taking a little R and R with the
Doolittle twins, there was this monkey show that you
wouldn't believe, and Dale Doolittle, he was the larger
of the two, come to think of it, for twins they didn't
look at all alike...
CATHERINE
PETE!!!
PETE
Sorry, Poodle.
(returns to the box, the slats and sections)
The trick is to fit the pieces together just so...
CATHERINE
(with renewed hope)
Yes. And how long is that going to take?
Pete concentrates on the puzzle box, brow furrowed, lips pursed. A long beat.
PETE
This could take years.

BOBBY BRIGGS and SHELLY JOHNSON sit in a booth. Shelly is in uniform, she's got

BOBBY

takes to get ahead in this world. I'm reading up,
watching TV: suddenly it comes to me. Boom. The

People's Conspiracy.
SHELLY
(sardonic)
Know any senators I can marry?
BOBBY
(pulling pamphlet from his jacket)
Check it out. Miss Twin Peaks. Once we get that crown
on your head, the sky's the limit.
SHELLY
(a little weary of pipedreams)
Dream on, Bobby. I got tables to wait on...
BOBBY
(curt)
Don't argue. Bobby's in charge, understand? You gotta
enlist by this afternoon.
It's an order, not a request. Bobby holds out the brochure. Shelly pauses, wounded by his
attitude. He doesn't care what she thinks. But Shelly takes the brochure nonetheless.

MILFORD
Of course. I've given a speech or two in my time. I'll.

the judges.
(to the point one more time)
You can guarantee it.
MILFORD

But... but... but... but... it would be wrong.

ANNIE BLACKBURNE carries a pot of coffee, offers a refill or two. She reaches the cash
register ... and finds Cooper waiting for her. Annie brightens like the sun.
ANNIE
Hi.
COOPER
Morning, Annie.
ANNIE
Breakfast?
COOPER
Sorry. I've got a police cruiser full of hungry lawmen
waiting in the parking lot. A box of donuts, to go. And
a cup of hot coffee for the road.
ANNIE
Coming right up.
Annie turns to retrieve, a little disappointed. Cooper watches her calls out.
COOPER
And Annie...?
(off her look, unusually awkward)
I was wondering if you were available later for a little
nature study. Together.
ANNIE
Nature study? Sure.
COOPER
(realizing)
How strange.
ANNIE
What?
COOPER
When I speak to you I get am odd tingling sensation in
my stomach and toes.

Annie steps away. Shelly rings up a sale on the cash register, frowns as Bobby steps to the door
without a goodbye. Then, at last, he turns to face her.
BOBBY
You're beautiful, Shelly. Got it? So take advantage.
Bobby makes her feel like it's a curse. Bobby exits. Shelly sighs, quotes:
SHELLY
What is all this sweet work worth, if thou kiss not me?
Shelly turns to see Cooper staring at her. He looks as though he's seen a ghost.
COOPER
What did you say?
SHELLY
Someone sent me a poem. It was anonymous.
COOPER
I need to see that poem immediatley, Shelly. Please.
SHELLY
Sure.
Shelly reaches under the counter, retrieves her purse. She hands her third of the poem to
Cooper. He inspects it.
SHELLY
We each got a piece. Donna, Audrey, and me.
COOPER
I'll have to take this with me.
Shelly nods assent. Annie returns bearing donuts and coffee.
ANNIE

This afternoon...?
COOPER
I'll meet you here. Four o'clock sharp.
With that, he vanishes, clutching Shelly's poem along with the donuts and joe. HOLD ON
Shelly and Annie. They exchange a look, wonder what's on his mind.

9. INT. SHERIFF'S STATION - DAY
OPEN ON Deputy Andy in the station conference room. He stands at the blackboard,
painstakingly reproduces the cave painting upon it. Andy erases, alters, draws primitive lines
on the slate.
CUT TO:
10. SHERIFF TRUMAN'S OFFICE
Agent Cooper and Sheriff Truman confer in the latter's office. Truman examines the poem
fragment Shelly gave to Cooper.
TRUMAN
Mountains kiss... waves clasp... what's this all about,
Coop?
COOPER
It's part of a poem, torn into thirds. Sent to Shelly
Johnson, Audrey Horne, and Donna Hayward... by
Windom Earle.
TRUMAN
Earle's contacted all three? Are you sure?
COOPER
(quoting the poem from memory)
See the mountains kiss high Heaven
And the waves clasp one another;
No sister-flower would be forgiven
If it disdained its brother...
(beat)
I sent this same poem to Caroline once.
TRUMAN
I don't like the sound of this.
COOPER
It may be nothing more than a taunt. Earle takes a sick
pride in his ability to insinuate himself into innocent lives.
TRUMAN
And if it's not?
COOPER
Let's talk to the girls as soon as possible. See what they
recall.
Deputy Hawk enters.

HAWK
Major Briggs is here. Conference room.
(offering manila envelope)
Donna Hayward's poem. Audrey Horne is in Seattle
until tomorrow.
Cooper opens the envelope, removes another fragment, aligns it with the first on Truman's
desk. He peers at the poem for a beat, preoccupied, an idea forming. Hawk turns to exit.
COOPER
Hawk?
(off his look)
Bring me Leo Johnson's arrest report. Anything that
might have his handwriting on it.
Hawk, nods, exits. Truman wonders:
TRUMAN
What's the connection?
COOPER
(staring at poem fragments)
There isn't one. Yet.
CUT TO:
11. CONFERENCE ROOM
Major Briggs watches Deputy Andy transcribe the cave painting with fascination. As Andy
connects two figures, the Major suddenly interrupts:
BRIGGS
Deputy Brennan? As I remember, the line you are
drawing should proceed downward, not across.
Andy checks the original rendering on his sketch pad. Andy erases, redraws. Then it hits him.
He turns to Major Briggs, mystified.
ANDY
How did you know that?
Cooper and Truman enter.
COOPER
Major Briggs. We need your help. Yet I find it
difficult to accurately describe why or how.
BRIGGS
(on the same wave length)
Go on.
(CONTINUED)
#2.019

11. CONTINUED:
COOPER
The Twin Peaks Sheriffs department is currently
involved in several disparate investigations. The
disappearance of a known felon, Leo Johnson. The
appearance of my former partner, a murderer, Windom
Earle. And the discovery of an ancient hieroglyph in a
place called Owl Cave.
(beat)
Logic demands that these investigations remain separate
entities. But recent developments suggest otherwise. I
believe that these mysteries are not separate entities, but
are in fact complimentary verses of the same song. I
cannot hear the song yet, Major Briggs. But I can feel it.
And that is enough for me to proceed.
BRIGGS
As a military man, I am familiar with damage done by
blind adherence to logic. How exactly may I help you?
COOPER
I need to know everything there is to know about
Windom Earle's work with Project Blue Book.
BRIGGS
That would involve accessing classified Air Force
computer files.
COOPER
Yes, it would.
BRIGGS
My security clearance was revoked shortly after my
disappearance.
COOPER
And your ability to access the Blue Book files?
BRIGGS
The issue is not one of access. There are, however,
certain moral judgements I must consider.
COOPER
Of course.
BRIGGS
Will this information help you to prevent future loss of
life?
COOPER
Yes.
(CONTINUED)
#2.019

11. CONTINUED:(2)
BRIGGS
Can you gain this intelligence without my intervention?
COOPER
No.
Pause. Briggs rises, steps to the blackboard. Andy's rendering of the cave painting upon it.
BRIGGS
Is this a copy of the hieroglyph you found in Owl Cave?
COOPER
(joining Briggs)
Yes. Do you know it?
BRIGGS
I have dreamed it. Or seen it. Somewhere. Somehow.
Briggs stares at the hieroglyph for a long beat. Then turns to face Cooper and the rest.
BRIGGS
I will do what you ask.
Deputy Hawk enters with a file, hands it to Cooper.
HAWK
Leo Johnson's arrest report.
Cooper takes the file, opens it. He finds examples of Johnson's handwriting. As the others
look on, Cooper arrays the sample next to the poem fragments. As he works:
COOPER
The damage Leo suffered would no doubt alter certain
handwriting characteristics. But his basic style remains
the same...
(putting the pieces together, turning to the others)
This poem, sent by Windom Earle, was transcribed by
Leo Johnson.
TRUMAN
Leo's working for Earle?
COOPER
(looking back at poem)
Yes. Or is his captive.
HOLD ON this tableau for a beat. Cooper, Truman, Hawk, Andy, and Major Briggs. The
evidence before them. Verses to the same song.

Tremayne frowns, sniffs. Then spots someone OFF-SCREEN.
TREMAYNE

Mr. Horne!!
Tremayne hurries to intercept BEN HORNE as he passes through the dining room.
BEN
Yes?
TREMAYNE
Mr. Horne as you are no doubt aware there are but scant
hours until our wine tasting benefit begins and I cannot
find your daughter anywhere.
BEN
Audrey is spending the day in Seattle. However, I'm
sure our concierge will be happy to assist.
TREMAYNE
The concierge. Yes, capital. Thank you Mr. Horne.
Tremayne rushes on. But Horne calls after.
BEN
(doesn't know his name)
Excuse me. You there.
TREMAYNE
(turning to face him)
Richard Tremayne, sir. Men's fashions.
BEN
Of course. Tell me, how is your nose?
TREMAYNE
Oh, Mr. Horne. Think nothing of it. A nose is a small
price to pay in the service of a greater good.
BEN
We'll of course take care of your medical expenses.
TREMAYNE
(sycophant and conniver both)
How kind. One might also think worker's compensation
of some variety will be involved...

EARLE
Drink up, friend. We celebrate.
Leo carries the beer to the youth, now revealed INSIDE a huge papier mache CHESS PIECE.
YOUTH
Celebrate? I can barely move my arms.
Leo carefully puts the can to the youth's lips, offers a hearty swallow. Earle places the last few
pieces upon the wire frame, effectively encasing the heavy metal youth inside.
EARLE
You have lived your short life in odium and obscurity.
But now, at the end, you will step upon the larger stage.
I must confess, I envy you. Your journey begins at a point
beyond imagining. Who knows where you might travel

YOUTH
Well I'm real cool about helpin' out and everything. But
how do I get out of this thing?
EARLE
(simply)
You don't.
Earle reaches into a chest, produces a wooden bow. He turns to Leo, orders.
EARLE
Leo. Fetch me an arrow.
Leo pauses - he's been feeding beer to the youth all along - turns to regard him.
YOUTH
Arrow. Whoa, man. I do not appreciate practical jokes.
EARLE
Leo. The arrow.
Leo sets the can of beer upon a table, faces Earle. And does not move. He manages:
LEO
N.... no.
Earle doesn't hesitate. He grabs the shock collar remote, presses the appropriate button. Leo
shivers and falls, struck down by its power.
YOUTH
Jeez, don't zap the geek. How'm I supposed to get my
beer without...
Earle zaps Leo a second time, lifting him clear of the floor. Leo moans, crawls to his knees.
YOUTH
Oh, dude ... that's gotta hurt...

Leo staggers, stands. And walks to a basket near his makeshift bed. He retrieves an arrow -
whittled to perfection, armed with a wicked steel point - and brings it back to Earle.
LEO
(wounded and fearful)
Arrow...
EARLE
Thank you, Leo.
Earle turns back to the papier mache chess piece, the youth trapped inside.
YOUTH
What's with the arrow, man... what are you doing?! This
isn't funny, man. This is not funny.
EARLE
Please. Be still.
YOUTH
What the hell are you doing...?!?
EARLE
(loading arrow as the youth continues to plead)
Think of all the hapless sinners, wondering where their
soul's destination lies? Think of the prayers and the
doubt, the gut-sucking fear that visits late at night. And
for what? To gain the answer to a simple question.
Where will my spirit wake? What life am I given after
my life? This grave question has plagued man's sorry
conscience for eons. And you, lucky boy, have the
answer... now.
Earle UNLEASHES the arrow, it tears through the air, pierces the heart of the papier mache
chess piece... and the heart of the heavy metal youth inside.
ANGLE ON CHESS PIECE
The arrow buried up to the hilt. A small trickle of blood seeping from the hole it makes.
ANGLE ON LEO
Watching the later with undisguised shock and horror. Wakened from one nightmare to
another.

This is going to be a very exciting year. A very exciting

Gentlemen. My purpose is simple. The age of the
ogling, swimsuited jiggle festivals of the past is dead.
Miss Twin Peaks, I believe rightly, is now a celebration

and for taking that step, gentlemen, I applaud you.
