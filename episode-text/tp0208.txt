2. INT. PALMER HOUSE LIVING ROOM - MORNING
The camera slowly moves across the room, picking up family portraits, and the photograph
of Laura as Homecoming Queen. Off camera Leland can be heard softly humming. We pull
back, Leland, stands in the middle of the floor holding a golf club preparing to swing... he
let's one go. The door bell rings. He walks off camera to answer it. It's DONNA and JAMES.
LELAND (O.S.)
Donna, James, come on in ...
They enter the living room
DONNA
We just came by to say goodbye to Maddy.
LELAND
Oh, I'm sorry, you just missed her. I dropped her
off at the bus station not twenty minutes ago.
JAMES
(slightly stunned)
She's gone?
Donna looks, at James, trying to get a read on his reaction.
LELAND
Yes. She thought you were coming by last night.
James and Donna glance at each other.
JAMES
Did she say anything?
LELAND
I'd have to say she was a little disappointed -
Sarah calls from upstairs.
SARAH (O.S.)
Leland?

He goes halfway up the stairs. Donna and James look at each other.
DONNA
I'm glad we were together last night, and I'm not
sorry we missed her, are you?
JAMES
No.
Leland returns.
LELAND
You could try writing, I'm sure she'd love to hear
from you. Do you have her address?
DONNA
Yes. Sorry to have bothered you.
LELAND
No bother, say hi to your folks for me, Donna.
She nods, Leland walks them to the door and they leave. From off screen ...
SARAH'S VOICE
Leland? Something else?
Leland closes the closet door.
LELAND
Yes, dear?
SARAH'S VOICE
Remember to sign us up for Glenn Miller night at
the club.

5. INT. DOUBLE R DINER - DAY
CLOSE on a large plate of mashed potatoes being carried out to a customer. We pull back.
There stands VIVIAN SMYTHE, a woman of breeding, with the pearls to prove it. Two steps
behind her is ERNIE NILES, if class were a drive down the middle of a fairway, Ernie pushed
it into the light rough. Close, but no cigar. He carries a cellular phone.
NORMA
(a bit stunned)
Mother?
Norma sets the plate down in front of TOAD. Vivian inspects it.
VIVIAN
I trust those are real potatoes and not flakes.
NORMA
Real potatoes. What a nice ... what a surprise.
Before Toad can take a bite Vivian reaches over, takes a fork from the counter and tests his
potatoes.
VIVIAN
Hmm, very good. I see they taught Henry a skill in
the stockade. Where is your charming husband?
NORMA
Hank's ... not here right now.
VIVIAN
I see.
Vivian starts to walk along the counter, checking out the place.
NORMA
Mother, if you don't mind my asking, what are you
doing here?
VIVIAN
I wanted to introduce you to my husband. Ernie, this
is Norma. Ernie's a financial analyst.
Ernie waves from his cellular phone.
ERNIE
Hi, how are you?
NORMA
Husband...?

VIVIAN
(blithe, secure)
We're honeymooning.
Norma reels just a little. But before she has a chance to question or reply:
ERNIE
Norma, could I trouble you for a cup of coffee?
Norma nods, gets the coffee. Vivian sits at the counter.
VIVIAN
I just love what you've done to your little diner,
Norma. The plastic flowers add such a nice measure
of cheer.
(brushing crumbs off the counter)
And the tablecloths are most attractive.
Norma takes the coffee to Ernie.
ERNIE
Thanks so much - nice to see those good looks
didn't isolate themselves to one generation.
(winks sweetly, then yells in the phone)
No, I need London gold figures, I've got a
trader in Tokyo with petrodollars to burn.
(more trouble with the phone)
Damn... reception's terrible out here.
(line goes dead)
It went "roam" again.
Norma rejoins her mother.
VIVIAN
You still look very smart in that uniform, Norma.
Such a nice figure and you've kept it well.
NORMA
Mother, I don't mean to be rude; how long are you
going to be here?
VIVIAN
In town? A few days. Ernie wanted to spend some
time in the county. Why?
NORMA
I wish you'd let me know you were coming*
VIVIAN
I didn't want you to make a fuss. You know me,
dear, I'm easy. What's wrong?

NORMA
Nothing. There's a food critic coming and I'm a
little short handed, that's all.
VIVIAN
Food critic? Oh, that's why you've tried so hard to
make everything look nice.
Norma takes a shot at a smile, comes up a little short. Ernie's off the phone, comes over, sets
his paper and cup down on the counter.
ERNIE
Norma, looking forward to spending more time
with you. Do they have cellular service in the car.
Vivian, if it's all right with you we should check in,
there's a Tokyo fax wait for me at the desk.
VIVIAN
We'll be at the Northern, dear. Sorry we missed
Henry. I'll call later.
Vivian and Ernie leave. Norma picks up the paper Ernie left behind. Notices that he wasn't
looking at the Dow Jones, but rather the spread sheet from the USA TODAY sports section
where he has circled his choices with a magic marker. We can see "Houston, 3 1/2, take the
points."

6. INT. GREAT NORTHERN LOBBY - DAY
Cooper and Truman step through the Great Northern Lobby. Cooper speaks quietly, into his
recorder.
COOPER
Diane... 10:00 a.m. at the Great Northern. I've just
been in a hotel room with the One-armed Man... or
what's left of him. In another time, another culture,
this man would have been a seer, a shaman priest...
possibly a leader. In our world, he's a shoe peddler,
and lives in the shadows.
As he speaks, Cooper notices someone up ahead. He pauses, shuts off the recorder. It's
Leland Palmer.
COOPER
Leland Palmer.
CLOSE on LELAND, holding a golf club, doing a soft shoe routine for a group of entralled
CHEERLEADERS. He slowly slides his foot around in a wide circle. Cooper and Truman
exchange a look. They stop and watch. Leland finishes, the girls applaud. He sees Cooper and
Truman, starts over.

He hasn't been charged yet, but we're holding him.
LELAND
Ben? There must be some mistake ... I thought
Jacques Renault ...
COOPER
No.
LELAND
(that brings him back)
Is there a strong case against him?
TRUMAN
(a look at Cooper)
I think so.
LELAND
I see.
Leland seems to be struggling with powerful emotions.
COOPER
Are you all right? Mr. Palmer?
LELAND

The law will handle this.

As it should be.

9. INT. JAIL - DAY
BEN HORNE sits on the bunk in his cell holding a pillow and sniffing It. It's clearly disgusting
The detention area door opens, Ben stands up, JERRY HORNE is led in to see his brother. He
carries an enormous brief case, stuffed with papers.
BEN
Jerry, what the hell took you so long?
They stand and look at each other through the bars for a moment.
JERRY
Date lines, time zones, I don't even know where I
am. God, you look terrible.
The deputy opens the cell door. Jerry hands him a small Japanese flag. Jerry, steps inside. The
deputy closes the door and leaves. The Brothers look at each other for a long moment.
BEN
Jerry ...
JERRY
Ben ...
They suddenly embrace long and hard, then step back.
JERRY (CONTINUED)
Ben, since your regular mouthpiece has been charged
with murder himself, I'm going to handle your case
personally. Let's get started: did you kill her?
BEN
(upset)
Jerry!
JERRY
Sorry, you're right, the last thing a good defense
attorney needs to know is the truth.

BEN
It happens to be the truth.
JERRY
Oh dear, Any sign of her? Bone fragments, teeth, a
charred corroborating note regarding your
whereabouts?
(Ben shakes his head no)
I'm so depressed.
A dejected Ben sits down on the bottom bunk. Jerry starts to bang his head on the bunk bed.
He suddenly realizes what his head is hitting.
JERRY
(smiles)
Bunk beds.
He jumps up onto the upper bunk, stretches out. Neither says a thing for a moment.
JERRY
Do you remember our first room, Ben?
BEN
(remembering a simpler time)
Yes ...

Jerry takes an enormous ginger root out of his pocket and hands it down to his brother.
JERRY
Ginger root. I'm supposed to take a bath in it when
I get home. Then dry my right side with my right
hand and my left with my left hand. Cures jet lag.
Little trick I picked up from a Geisha named Meko.
She boiled my shirts. Wish you'd been there, Ben ...
she had the cutest little feet.
Ben looks at the strange shaped root, breaks it in half.

snapping, dyed hair, walking and talking disaster area. She carries her new BABY.
GWEN

bladder, and they wanted my urine. Infection? I
hadn't been near a rusty nail. You remember that
time my toe turned purple? So instead I took a bath
in baking soda. My toe came around but I got the
worst cramps, like you swallowed a kinked hose -
HAWK walks by.

Close on the sharp point of a small surgical instrument.
HAYWARD
This won't hurt a bit.
We pull back. Doc Hayward is about to take a blood sample from Ben Horne's index finger.
Jerry and Truman look on. Cooper stands back in the room, out of the light.
JERRY
Sheriff, I protest this brutal treatment of my client.
After all this man has done for this town.
Hayward looks at Jerry, jabs the lancet into Ben's Finger, a bit harder than is usual.
BEN
Ow!
Hayward smears blood onto a slide He sticks a cotton ball on Ben's finger.
HAYWARD (CONTINUED)
(to Truman and Cooper)
I'll have results in a couple of hours.
Hayward leaves. Jerry tries to take charge.
JERRY
Gentlemen, I demand that my client be released or
charged. Never! in all my years practicing law have
I witnessed such complete and utter disregard for an
accused man's constitutional rights ...

Do you know what this is, Mr. Horne?
BEN
A ... book.
COOPER
Look at it closely.
He does.
BEN
(cautiously)
A ... diary.
Cooper lays out a playing card - a one-eyed jack. They stare at it.
COOPER
We know all about One Eyed Jacks ... so did Laura.
Cooper picks up the diary, reads from it.
COOPER
"I'm going to tell the world about Ben Horne. I'm
going to tell them who Ben Horne really is."
(puts the diary down)
But she never got the chance, did she?
(pause)
Come on, Ben, we're all grown-ups here ... a wild,
young girl like Laura. Things spin out, of control.
She becomes a threat. Not just to you, your business

You can't talk to me like this!
It's all Jerry can do to control his brother.

Truman steps around the table and helps Ben into his chair.
TRUMAN
Sit down, Mr. Horne.
They all try to catch their breath for a moment.
JERRY
Gentlemen, I'd like a moment alone with my
brother, with my client. ... if you don't mind.
Truman looks at Cooper, he nods "Yes".
COOPER
You have your moment.
Cooper picks up the diary, and exits the room with Harry. Jerry rubs Ben's shoulders.
JERRY
Ben, Ben, Ben ... if you're going to blurt out a
confession our options shrink down to a tiny little
nub.

12. INT. LEO JOHNSON'S HOUSE - DAY
Close on a dual cassette deck. As the cassette spins in one deck, we pull back. BOBBY BRIGGS
looms above. He holds a small micro-recorder to the built-in microphone of the cassette
deck. Ben Horne's and Leo's voice's are heard from the micro-recorder.
LEO (TAPE)
Burn the mill?
BEN (TAPE)
Keep it simple. Insurance investigator should read
"arson," block letters, about uh, six feet high.
LEO (TAPE)

resting comfortably, then begins to twitch. His eyes suddenly open. "Mike" is back. We pull
back, a NURSE, sitting next to the door.
MIKE

He's close ...

POV of the Deputy, as he reaches the door, pushes it open, and enters. The bed is empty,
curtains blow in an open window.
Gerard/Mike steps out from the shadows behind the door. We pull back as he raises a blunt
instrument in the air and brings it down on the unsuspecting Deputy's head. Voices are heard
in the hallway, Mike turns, looks toward the open window.

Norma, because of the bad choices I made, there are
people out there, people from my past, who want to
see me fail. I've tried fighting them. That just got
me in more trouble. I've tried running, but there's
always someone faster. I know it's no way for a man
to live his life, bur sometimes it's best just to hole up
and wait for the storm to pass. I didn't mean to hurt
you, I'm just trying to keep my head above water ...

Maybe next time, you should ask for help.

sure anymore.
Ben springs out of the bunk over to the bars.
BEN
What does she want? I'll pay it ... anything.
Pete chuckles.
CATHERINE (TAPE)
In exchange for my testimony, you will sign the mill
and Ghostwood estates back over to me. I will
consider letting you keep your precious hotel.

CATHERINE (TAPE)
A representative of mine will come to you with the

I'm confident you'll go on from here to excel at one
of the many fine career opportunities offered by the
federal prison system. Ben, so nice to see you again.
PETE

That Catherine ...
BEN
(stunned)
She set me up. She set me up.
PETE
She's a caution, isn't she?
Pete leaves. We move in on Ben, a slow burn. He turns around, grabs a pillow from the bed,
wildly attacks the bars with it.
BEN
(out of control, a frightening violent rage)
No!... no .... no ... no ... no ... no ... nooooo!
We pull back, feathers floating everywhere. Ben stands in the middle of it. Lost for the first

Truman and Cooper step out of the Bronco, as does Ed out of his truck.

Harry, Agent Cooper, are you all right?
TRUMAN

ED
I'm fine. I was, was just on my way out to the club
to break in out some new irons. Boron. Graphite

Truman and Cooper are ready to leave it there.
ED
Oh. Oh, I did remember something. As you'd
asked? The night Laura died. I was working late at
the station. Around ten. Ben Horne shows up in his
fancy car. He looks real agitated, talking to
himself. I heard him say something about a 'dairy.'
TRUMAN
A dairy?
ED
Yes, I think so.
COOPER
A diary?
ED
(thinks)
That might've been it.
Ed notices that Cooper is looking at the back of his pickup. Truman's radio crackles with a
call. He goes to answer it.
ED
Are you a golfer, Agent Cooper?
COOPER
Yes. I enjoy its precision.
ED
(smiles)
May I show you my new clubs?
Ed walks over to the back of his pickup. Ed picks up a club, as if it were a weapon, turns, and
starts toward Cooper. Truman steps out of the Bronco.
TRUMAN
They found Gerard, near the waterfall.
COOPER
Let's go get him.

me know.

We will..
Cooper and Truman get in the Bronco and drive off. Ed watches them, then begins to laugh
wickedly as he walks back-to the rear, throws the club inside.
He climbs in behind the wheel, looks in the rear view mirror. It's "Bob."

Hawk walks through the station doors escorting Gerard, who's one arm is handcuffed to his
belt. As they pass the reception area we pick up Lucy putting a cold compress on Andy's
forehead. Her sister sits next to them holding the baby, keeping up a running dialogue.
GWEN
- the same thing used to happen to me when I first
got pregnant, I'd be out shopping, and boom, pass
right out in the produce section, then come to
covered with bruises and crushed fruit and strangers
standing over waiting to see if I was dead; people
want terrible things to happen to you, I know -
Andy, who's been attempting to follow the story stares at Gwen for a moment, then turns to
Lucy.
ANDY
I want to talk to you about my sperms.
GWEN
Sperms, that's all men think about; I remember when
Little Kal was born they laid him on my breast
I looked down and saw what kind of a tiny creature
we were dealing with and I thought, good god, just
what the world doesn't need, another sperm
running around loose, women beware.
They both stare at her.
GWEN (CONTINUED)
Well I did.
ANDY
(to Lucy)
I had mine counted. Twice. The first time they
were all dead.
GWEN
If I had a nickel for every time I heard that.
ANDY
The second time they were jumping like salmon
swimming upstream.
GWEN
So of course all you could think of was spawning.

She moves away. Andy and Lucy turn to each other.
ANDY
So when you told me that you were pregnant I didn't
think it could be me because mine were all dead
supposedly at the time.
LUCY
Uh-huh.
ANDY
But they got better. I was misinformed.
(beaming)
I'm the father.
LUCY
(knows it's more complicated)
Oh brother ...
ANDY
(starting to crestfall)
Aren't I?
They look at each other. Lucy puts her head in her hands.

Ben Horne stands in the middle of the dimly light room. The One-Armed Man slowly circling
him like a blood hound. Cooper, Truman and Jerry Horne are also in the room. Gerard
stops, pale and weak turns away from Ben, sits, speaks softly to Cooper and Truman.
GERARD
He has been close ... Bob is not here now ...
Jerry moves to them.
JERRY
Sheriff, isn't there something you'd like to share
With us?
Gerard stares at him.

JERRY
Who's Bob? I don't know a Bob.
(to Ben)
Do we know a Bob?
(grandstanding)
Sheriff, no offense, but clearly this man's stairs don't
reach all the way to the attic. Now your 24 hours are
up; you either charge my client or let him.
Hawk walks into the room, hands Truman a note. He reads it then hands it to Cooper.
Truman walks over and leans on the table, glares at Ben.
TRUMAN
I'm charging you with the murder of Laura Palmer.
BEN
Good move, Jerry.
GERARD
No, no ...
TRUMAN
Hawk, take Mr. Gerard back to the hotel. Nail the
windows shut, I want two men on his door
Hawk takes Gerard and escorts him out.

Cooper and Truman step into the corridor.

Harry, I think we're saddling the horse here before

TRUMAN

COOPER
I don't think Ben Horne killed Laura Palmer.
TRUMAN
What?
COOPER
We should release him.
TRUMAN
(very frustrated)
Coop, look, I've tried to help you every step of the
way, I've stood by you. But I have had just about
enough of giants, dwarfs, dreams and throwing rocks
at Tibetan milk bottles. Somebody does a crime,
it's my job to lock 'em up. And I cannot in good
conscience let a man walk from my jail who I think
is a killer! I can't do it.
Cooper looks at Harry, smiles.
COOPER
You're right. This is your backyard. Sometimes an
outsider can forget that.
Cooper pats Harry on the arm. Walks away. We move in on Truman, wondering how and
why he won that battle so easily.

ERNIE
Mine too.
Hank smiles, barbecue sauce on his chin.
HANK

Norma stands. The evening is not going well.
NORMA
Will you excuse me for a moment?
VIVIAN
I'll join you.
Ernie stands as they leave. Hank hurriedly rises as well, wiping off his chin.
ERNIE
Ladies ... hurry back.
They leave. Ernie stands for a moment then sits back down. Hank sets down the rib. They
study each other for a moment.
ERNIE (CONTINUED)
You're not going to say anything, are you? If Vivian
ever found out I was "inside," she'd leave me flat.

Hank puts a hand on Ernie's shoulder, gives him a rough shake. Ernie tries to smile, but
Hank clearly makes him nervous.
HANK
So what's the angle here with Miss Moneybags,
anyway?
ERNIE
There's no angle.
HANK
Come on, buddy, we never had any secrets. Vivian's
rolling in dough.
ERNIE
Vivian and I met at a Republican fundraiser. We're
married.
HANK
(admiring)
You musta told her some tall tale. A whopper.
ERNIE
I am trying very hard to tell nothing but the truth
these days. It's therapeutic.
(as if to prove the benefit)
Vivian wants me to handle all her investments.
HANK
What about yours? You gonna introduce her to your
loansharks?
ERNIE
I'm out of it, Hank. I don't gamble anymore. I go
to meetings. I go to church, too.
HANK
So does Vivian know you ran off with the
congregation's picnic fund?
ERNIE

I would never steal from a church. It was a savings
and loan. I was sick, it was an illness and I've paid
my debt. It's a new life. A clean slate.

me. And one must be prepared to pay any price ...
to protect it. Wouldn't you agree?
ERNIE

I completely agree.
HANK
We'll talk some more, Ernie. I always enjoyed our
talks out in the yard - Man to man, prisoner to

Norma and Vivian return, Ernie rises abruptly. Hank more leisurely.

HANK

I'd like to propose a toast ... to the newlyweds and

Thank you, Henry. What a nice gesture.

We pull back from the curtains, blowing in the wind, pass over an untouched piece of pie,
stop on a shirtless Cooper, changing the dressing on his wound, still wearing his shoulder
holster. He picks up his mini recorder.
COOPER
Diane, 11:05, pm. Great Northern Hotel. Not a
star in the sky tonight. Ben Horne's in custody. If
the Great Northern grieves it bears its sadness in
silence ... the trail narrows, Diane. I'm close, but the
last few steps are always the darkest and most
difficult ...
A gust of wind wildly blows the curtains. Cooper, turns looks at it, there's a knock on the
door. He turns off the recorder, picks up his gun from the table. Cautiously walks to the
door. Opens it. AUDREY stands looking at a shirtless Cooper, holding a gun.
COOPER

They look at each other for a moment.
AUDREY
Can I come in? Talk?
COOPER
Of course.
She enters. Cooper reholsters his gun, Audrey looks at his wound.
