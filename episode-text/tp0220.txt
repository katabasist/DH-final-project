8. INT. DINER - DAY
Bobby and Shelly sit in a diner booth. Shelly holds a crumpled copy of her pageant speech.
SHELLY
(reading from speech)
"...and that's the only way we're ever going to save the
trees. It's time to stand up and kick some butt for our
environment. Before it's too late for all of us."
(gentle deadpan)
That's beautiful, baby. Letter perfect.
BOBBY
(the enthusiastic collaborater)
I'm not so sure about the "kicking butt" part. How 'bout
"Fight"?
(trying it out)
"It's time to stand up and fight for our environment?"
SHELLY
(quietly relieved, making correction)
Hundred per cent better.
BOBBY
(mind on something more important)
Shel ... I been thinkin'...
SHELLY
(putting pen and speech away)
I know, I know. The speech counts double everything else
in the contest -
BOBBY
I been thinking about us.
SHELLY
(looking up)
You were?
BOBBY
I know I haven't been paying the right kind of attention to
you lately. I got busy with Mr. Horne, I'm wearing suits,
okay? And suddenly I'm walkin' around like I'm more
important than everybody else.
SHELLY
You were pretty crummy. I was lonely, Bobby. I missed
all the things we used to do together.
BOBBY
When I saw you kissin' that guy, something snapped. It's

BOBBY (continued)
like my brain rolled over. And I could see all the stuff
that's special to me. The stuff that matters.
(takes hold of her hand)
I love you, Shelly. I want to dedicate my time to that I
mean if that's okay with you.
A beat. Shelly smiles, leans closer.
SHELLY
What do you think?
She leans across the table to give him a long, passionate kiss. Finally:
BOBBY
(quietly)
Lucky, lucky me.
Suddenly: an OFF-SCREEN VOICE interrupts:
VOICE
Shelly! Phone. It's the Sheriffs office.
Shelly reacts, steps from the booth to answer.

LUCY
What do you know about saving our planet?
ANDY
(after a beat)
I know it's in lots of trouble.
Lucy hands him a Miss Twin Peaks flyer.
LUCY
Andy, I'm taking fate into my own hands mostly
because the suspense is killing me. Tomorrow is D-Day.
"Dad Day." In twenty-four hours I will choose the father
of my child. Deputy Andrew Brennen. Or Clothing
Salesmen Richard Tremayne.
ANDY
(thrilled, frightened, confused)
What does that have to do with the Miss Twin Peaks
contest?
LUCY
I -
(remembering her baby)
We could use the money. We could also use a father.
(re flyer)
So I have to give a speech about saving our planet which
is a great concept but I have no idea how to go about
doing it. Yet.
ANDY
(looking up from flyer)
I do know that people have got to stop sinking their beer
cans in Pearl Lake when they're fishing.
LUCY
(grabbing pencil and paper)
Beer cans...
ANDY
And styrofoam never dies for as long as you live.
Lucy and Andy huddle together, consider man's fate.

tell if it is day or night. At one end is the blackboard with a drawing of the cave painting. A
MOVE down the table reveals computers, more paraphanalia. Piles of charts, library books,
plus attempts to duplicate the dowels that shot out of the cave wall.
MAJOR BRIGGS, who looks like he's been up all night, guides Bookhouse Boy CAPPY
through a reference book while pointing at the drawing.
BRIGGS
See if any of these symbols have to do with harvest
schedules or ancient calendars. Look for any curious
nomenclature.
CAPPY
Got it, Chief.
Cappy gets to work. Cooper and Truman enter, exchange greetings.
COOPER
Garland, you're exhausted.
Briggs gestures toward a small box atop his desk filled with files, notebooks, a videotape.
BRIGGS
I spent the night obtaining and perusing the Project Blue
Book files regarding Windom Earle. I found it
impossible to sleep after.
COOPER
What did you learn?
BRIGGS
Windom Earle was the best and brightest among us. But
when our attention turned from outer space to the
wooded areas surrounding Twin Peaks, he became
destructively obsessive. Earle acted in an overzealous
and secretive manner. Possessive of his assignments.
And finally, violent. He was removed from the project.
Briggs reaches into the box, removes the video tape, inserts it into a VCR.
BRIGGS
I found this in the Project archives.
Briggs turns on recorder and monitor. A beat. GRAINY BLACK AND WHITE footage
appears on the screen. Slightly out of focus, as if gleaned from a surveillance camera.
WINDOM EARLE, younger, wearing a white lab coat, faces an unseen interrogater. He
speaks with quiet contempt:

EARLE ON SCREEN
(in mid-oration)
... these evil sorcerers, dugpas, they call them, cultivate
evil for the sake of evil and nothing else. They express
themselves in darkness for darkness, without leavening
motive. This ardent purity has allowed them to access a
secret place of great power, where the cultivation of evil
proceeds in exponential fashion. And with it, the
furtherance of evil's resulting power. These are not fairy
tales, or myths. This place of power is tangible, and as
such, can be found, entered, and perhaps, utilized in some
fashion. The dugpas have many names for it, but chief
among them is the Black Lodge.
(beat)
But you don't believe me, do you? You think I'm mad.
Overworked. Go away.
Earle turns from the unseen camera. The screen goes BLACK. Cooper presses rewind, means
to view the tape in its entirety. We SEE Earle's, in black and white, image in reverse. Cooper
speaks OVER, shares his thought as he forms them.
COOPER
When Windom Earle returned, I assumed he had come
for vengeance. For me. But I miscalculated. Windom
has insinuated himself into the lives of those I care for.
He has murdered innocents. He has engaged us in
subterfuge and red herring. But those acts were merely
camouflage. Windom Earle is after something else.
The Black Lodge.
(re Earle on monitor screen)
What I want to know is, what does that, the Black
Lodge, have to do...
(re the blackboard hieroglyph)
...with this?
TRUMAN
You think there's a connection?
COOPER
Windom does.
(beat)
Harry, let's divide up Earle's files, check them top to
bottom. Cappy, find out everything you can about the
evil sorcerers known as dugpas. Garland, maybe you
should get some sleep.
BRIGGS
I could use a good stretch. Perhaps a walk in the woods
to clear my head.

COOPER
Fine. Harry?
Cooper and Truman divide the files. CAMERA MOVES IN on a plant nearby. It's the
familiar bonsai ... and the electronic bug hidden within.

4. INT. EARLE'S CABIN
WINDOM EARLE, earphone in place, listens and laughs. LEO JOHNSON stands next to
him.
EARLE
You know, Leo, the only thing Columbus discovered was
that he was lost. Cooper and the gang aren't even off the
snide, yet.
(studies the hieroglyph, in a sing song voice)
I know something they don't know.
(serious)
I know something Young Dale merely suspects.
MOVE BACK to see Earle has set up his own war room/command module. Bur Earle's work
seems more advanced and he has more equipment. The familiar chess board remains.
EARLE
Project Blue Book. Little men - pee wits loaded with
optimism. They were a deterrent so slight it was
practically encouragement.
Earle refers to his copy of the hieroglyph, means to transfer the image to his computer screen.
EARLE
Yet, I would like to ask Major Briggs a question or
three. Polish up that bald nub of his and see what shines.
Perhaps, Leo, we too should venture out for a good
stretch.
Earle brings the copy closer, compares it with his computer mockup. The chess board is in the
way. Earle sweeps it off the table. He is too absorbed in his work to notice Leo take the
CONTROL for the shock collar off the table and slide it into his pocket.

5. INT. HAYWARD HOUSE, ATTIC - DAY
DONNA HAYWARD sits on the floor of the attic. Frustrated. She has been through a lot of
boxes, tins, and trunks and not found a thing. She pulls down another box and behind it spots a
SCRAPBOOK Across it's cover it reads, "The Palavan Club." As she pulls the scrapbook

down documents fall out of it. Picking them up she sees that they are BEARER BONDS for
HORNE INDUSTRIES. Mixed in with those is an envelope. Inside the envelope is a
BIRTH CERTIFICATE that reads:
DONNA
(reading)
"Female Child. Mother, Eileen Hayward. Daughter
Donna Marie."
The name of the father has been left blank. Donna opens the scrapbook. She pores through the
pictures coming upon a photograph of her parents at a costume party, dressed as hoboes. The
theme of the party is written on an arch in the picture. It says, "Better Days." Donna whips
through more of the pictures till she comes upon one that stops her. Eileen and Doc smile out
at her from some long ago party. In between them is a smiling Ben Horne, his arms about Doc
and Eileen.. Then there is a photo of Ben and Eileen together. Ben grinning at the camera.
Eileen grinning at Ben. Donna stares at the picture until she is startled by her Mother's voice
from below.
EILEEN'S VOICE
Donna? Donna where are you?
Donna scrambles to put the bonds and the birth certificate back into the scrapbook.
DONNA
What is it, Mom?
EILEEN'S VOICE
Deputy Hawk is on the phone.
DONNA
Be right there.
After one more look Donna hides the scrapbook.

CLERK
Sorry, sir.
Nothing left to do. Wheeler sighs.
WHEELER
Would you send someone up for my bags.
CLERK
Perhaps you care to leave Ms. Horne a message.
Wheeler takes a pad from the clerk. Starts to write a note. Then crumples it up.
WHEELER
No. No. I'm afraid that isn't going to - Thanks.
Wheeler goes to the elevator.

6. INT. EARLE'S CABIN - DAY
Earle applies oil to his cross-bow, chatting with Leo, as is his custom, while he works.
EARLE
... you would have appreciated the dugpas, Leo. Ancient
sorcerers bent on evil. Rather like the Kali worshippers
of India. Another fine bunch of zanies, let me tell you.
Blood for breakfast, blood for lunch ... those were the
good old days.
Earle looks up, sees Leo standing before the three playing card Queens attached to the bulletin
board. Audrey, Donna, and Shelly. Leo turns to Earle, disturbed, confused.
EARLE
Do my anecdotes bore you?
LEO
Sh...sh ... Shelly.
EARLE
Yes. Very good, Leo. You remember.
LEO
Sh ... Shelly.
EARLE
Tawdry little trollop. Just between you and me, old
boy, your wife has some fairly modern views on marital
fidelity. No matter, she is still fit for a Queen. Would
you mourn her passing, Leo? I doubt it.
Leo stares at the picture of Shelly, then back to Earle. Uncertain, confused. Earle clarifies:
EARLE
Her death, Leo. Shelly's imminent demise. It's really
very simple. Shelly wins Miss Twin Peaks. Shelly
dies. Maybe you'd like to help.
LEO
Shelly. NO.
Leo understands. He means to save her. Leo reveals the shock collar control, waves it at Earle
is if the control, not the collar, delivered the painful shocks. Earle spies it, reacts with mock fear.
EARLE
My god, what do you have there, Leo?
(as Leo moves towards him)
No. Dear God, no.
(Leo waves the control at him)

EARLE (continued)
I'm begging you, Leo. I prithee, no. Have mercy.
Leo points the control at Earle.
LEO
Love .... Shelly ....
Leo hits the control and shocks himself. He flips about, confused. Earle moves to Leo.
Confused and frightened, Leo continues to pump on the control and continues to shock himself.
Finally, Earle takes the control from his helpless hand.
EARLE
Poor, Leo. We are all love's fools, more or less.
Earle takes out a pair of shackles, attaches them to Leo's legs.
EARLE
But you will learn, as I have, the value of hate. It makes
for better company I assure you.

Can't hurt to give it a shot.
ANNIE

Maybe next year.
COOPER
There's a whole new world out there, Annie. jump in.

"Hear the other side. See the other side."
ANNIE

St. Augustine. Coffee?
COOPER
You bet.
Annie pours, takes a closer look. Faint doubt amidst his ardor.
ANNIE
Something's troubling you.
COOPER
(surprised)
Yes.
ANNIE
Do you want to talk about it?
COOPER
(after a beat)
I am involved in a complicated investigation that
requires my total attention. Yet I spend most of my
time thinking about you.
ANNIE
I know the feeling. I've been seeing your face in fried
eggs all morning.

COOPER
There are those who believe in a scientific basis for
attraction. It's chemical.
ANNIE
Is that what this is?
COOPER
I don't know. Is it possible to understand without
perspective?
ANNIE
I spent five years trying.
COOPER
Faith.
ANNIE
It's difficult for me. But I have faith in you. In us, as I
understand it.
COOPER
We are very much alike.
ANNIE
It helps.
COOPER
But we think too much.
ANNIE
(her turn to quote)
"What we observe is not nature itself, but nature exposed
to our method of questioning."
COOPER
(his turn to recognize)
Heisenberg.
They share a warm beat. Kindred spirits from another time and place. Annie deadpans:
ANNIE
Maybe we should go bowling.
COOPER
No. Dancing.
ANNIE
I don't know how.

8. INT. ROADHOUSE - DAY
Decorations for the Miss Twin Peaks contest are being put up. A poster celebrating Norma as
a past Queen is leaning against the podium. SHELLY JOHNSON and BOBBY BRIGGS
rehearse on stage.
BOBBY
Shel, I know I haven't been paying the right kind of
attention to ya lately But when I saw that old guy
kissing you ... something snapped. It's when I realized what
I had or something. And I want to dedicate my time to
that.
SHELLY
(hopeful)
Sounds great to me.
BOBBY
(re her speech)
So let's try to get through the rest. And then we can
discuss it. Together.
Shelly peeks at her speech, sighs, and continues her recitation:
SHELLY
"Yes, I believe there are so many beautiful things in the
world that should be admired and be thankful for. For
example, Detroit auto makers reported a record year of
sales for sports cars."
(she stops)
I don't know, Bobby.
BOBBY
What's wrong now?

SHELLY
Well, for one thing, nowhere in this entire speech do we
mention ecology, or forests, or anything.
Bobby looks at the speech.
BOBBY
I don't know where I'd put it. The speech is so damn
tight as is.
SHELLY
But it's supposed to be about that.
BOBBY
Shel, you're gonna be wonderful. You'll win in a walk.
And then we are off. Fade out on Twin Peaks. Fade up
on Hollywood insider games. Sunset strip. Easy
street, baby. Just like you always wanted.
(steps back from her, examining her)
Maybe a new hairdo. Or some signature makeup. We
got to mesmerize.
Shelly sighs. Apology or not. He's hopeless.
ACROSS THE ROOM
LANA BUDDING stares nervously at her fellow contestants. MAYOR MILFORD hurries
into view, sits beside her.
MILFORD
(he tries to kiss her, she turns away)
I've got great news. It's going to be Norma Jennings and
Richard Tremayne. Tremayne is the third judge. It's in
the bag.
LANA
I have to be sure. I want to be sure that I'm going to win.
MILFORD
My god, the guy's British - or Bahamian. He's bound to
fall for your charms.
(snuggling closer)
We'll find a chance for you two to be alone. Wear one of
those dresses of yours with the slit cut half way up to
Seattle.

LANA
Not till I've won. Then and only then will I marry you.
MILFORD
You're so strict, darling,

And I am the g.d. Mayor!
It's no use. Lana will not be dissuaded. Milford takes head in hands.

DOC HAYWARD finishes giving BEN HORNE a physical. Doc is purring his stethoscope
away and Ben is buttoning up his shirt. Both are tense.
BEN
The insurance company's sent me so many forms I could
get a heart attack lifting them.
DOC
You're fine. It's what in your heart that you should
worry about.
BEN
I know you have reason to doubt me. But I am only
interested in doing the right thing. For the good of
everybody.
Doc takes a long look at Ben. He believes him.
DOC
Then stay away from Eileen.
BEN
I can't. Not as long as the lie survives.
DOC
Dammit, Ben. It isn't that simple. I believe you. I
applaud your desire to do the right thing. But goodness
in you is like a timebomb. And there's nothing good
about ruined lives.

Jack! Come in. You know Will Hayward.
Wheeler is obviously upset. For the first time unsure. He tries to be polite.
WHEELER
I met your daughter the other day. Beautiful girl.
DOC
I think I should get back to the office. Nice to see you,
John. Ben, be careful please.
Doc goes out. Ben motions to the chair in front of the desk but Wheeler is in too much of a
hurry.
WHEELER
Ben, I've been trying to find Audrey.
BEN
She should be back any minute.
WHEELER
(blurting it out)
I've got to go, Ben. They're gassing up the jet as we
speak.
BEN
Well, give her a call when you get to wherever it is you're
in such a hurry to get to.
WHEELER
Ben, a friend of mine, well, more than a friend, a partner,
was murdered last night.
Ben reacts with evident concern. Wheeler takes a chair and tries to relax.

HAWK
Audrey. Agent Cooper would like to see you at the
Sheriff's station.

12. EXT. WOODS - DAY
Briggs walks through the woods, dog tired but enjoying the solitude and nature. He stops to
inspect a particularly beautiful Douglas Fir. He runs his hands up and down the bark trying to
remember something. He fingers the tattoo behind his head. From behind him he hears
singing. He turns to see a COSTUME HORSE strolling down the path towards him. He
stares at it, stunned. The horse stops singing. Looks it Briggs.
HORSE
Hello, Wilbur.
A hand comes out from under the costume and a dart/tranquilizer whizzes out hitting Briggs
who wobbles away from the horse. He makes it about ten feet then topples over. The horse
stands over the downed pilot. Briggs desperately tries to focus on the horse head as it bends
over him.

OPEN ON the three pieces of paper forming the poem. Cooper is placing them together.
Shelly, Audrey, and Donna sit across from him.
COOPER
Each of you received a part of this poem. And each in a
curious manner. Along with an invitation.
AUDREY
We all went to the Roadhouse but nobody showed up.
COOPER
In the past few days have any of you had contact with a
stranger? Someone that sticks out as peculiar or
charming or just plain puzzling.
DONNA
(after a beat)
Well, there was that weird guy that claimed he was a
friend of Dad's.
SHELLY
The same day I got my poem I got a ten dollar tip for a
cup of coffee. That was pretty peculiar.
AUDREY
And there was a funny old guy at the library. He asked
me to read it to him.

START CLOSE on the mysterious black box, now open, sent to Catherine Martell.
CAMERA PANS, reveals the slightly smaller box found inside. Unlike the original, this
box has a finely filigreed lid, the twelve signs of the zodiac inscribed on its surface. A
HAND enters frame, pushes the zodiac signs. The filigreed squares give slightly, suggesting
that the correct combination will open it.
CATHERINE'S VOICE
(over latter)
His servant woman, what's her-name, Jones, delivered it
shortly after he died.
ANDREW
Eckhardt's last request. A clever jape, perhaps. Or
something of value..?
(seeking a way to open)
Try the hammer.
CATHERINE MARTELL and ANDREW PACKARD hover over the boxes. Catherine
ignores Andrew, presses the zodiac signs with increasing frustration.
CATHERINE
Won't work. There's a secret to opening each box, and
this one...
(exasperated, shoving the box away)
... is about to drive me mad.
Catherine pauses, seems about to hurl it through the nearest window. She turns to her brother.
CATHERINE
Tell me some good news, Andrew. Anything.
ANDREW
(fascinated by the black box)
Our foreign investors are chomping at the bit, from Paris
to Beijing. You'll get your golf course, Catherine. Right
next to the Great Northern Hotel.

ANDREW
He's too late. When the project was still in his
possession, Ben cleared every possible hurdle. Zoning,
impact statements. He was, and is, his own worst
enemy.
Andrew's focus shifts palpably to the mysterious box. He pushes the zodiac buttons, tries
different combinations.
CATHERINE
As always. What...?
ANDREW
Nothing, dear. Just trying a few simple combinations
CATHERINE
Let me.
Catherine tries to get at the second box, but Andrew will not give way. The mysterious gift
inspires a possessive mania in both.
ANDREW
One minute, Catherine. Eckhardt's birthday, my
birthday, I know, the date the gift arrived...
(the box springs open)
CATHERINE
Give it to me.
(grabs the box, peers inside)
Not again.
She withdraws a third black box, a little smaller than the last. Andrew doesn't hesitate:
ANDREW
I opened it.
Andrew snatches the third box. And, before Catherine can intercede, sets it upon the table,
grabs the hammer, and strikes it as hard as he can. The box splinters, opens. Catherine shoves
Andrew aside, reaches into it...
CATHERINE
(hopes dashed yet again)
Oh, Andrew...
... And pulls out a fourth and final box. Small and slender, stainless steel. As mysterious as

16. INT. EARLE'S CABIN - DAY
The sun makes its way through the cabin's window.
EARLE'S VOICE
When did you first see the symbol in Owl Cave?
An ARROW flies through the air, sticks deep into a brightly colored target. And just inches
from Major Briggs, bound upon it. Windom Earle stands at a near distance, holds out his free
hand for another arrow. Leo, subdued by his recent beating, complies. But when Earle turns
back to Briggs, Leo's eyes follow him with newfound mental vigor. He's beginning to reclaim
his senses.
BRIGGS
(brave to the last)
I am not at liberty to divulge that information.
EARLE
(playful, insane)
Cheater.
Earle lets fly another arrow, pinning Briggs right trouser leg to the target. And, judging by
the spot of blood that appears, piercing some part of his flesh as well.
EARLE
What does the cave painting mean?
BRIGGS
I am not at liberty to divulge that information.
EARLE
Damn, but I love the military mind!
Earle fires another arrow, this one strikes the target just inches from Briggs' ear.
EARLE
(with fervor equal to the previous questions)
What's the capital of North Carolina?
BRIGGS
Raleigh.
Earle extracts an ampule of amber liquid from his jacket, then a syringe. He draws the liquid
into it.

EARLE
Major, I admire your fortitude. Had I the time and the
patience, we might continue this game indefinitely.
However...
Earle jabs the syringe into Briggs' chest with sudden violence.
EARLE
...I have neither.
(turning back to Leo)
Catch.
Earle tosses the empty syringe at Leo. Leo dodges it. Earle turns back to Briggs. The drug
takes hold quickly. Briggs struggles deep within a narcotic haze. Earle whispers, he means to
test the drug's effect.
EARLE
Your name, please.
BRIGGS
Garland... Briggs.
EARLE
Garland, what do you fear most in the world?
BRIGGS
The possibility that love is not enough.
EARLE
Garland, please. I shall weep. How much does your
wife weigh?
BRIGGS
One hundred and fifteen pounds.
EARLE
Good for her. Now, when did you first see the
hieroglyph in Owl Cave?
BRIGGS
In...in dreams.
EARLE
What kind of dream?
BRIGGS
I went night-fishing with Agent Cooper. There was a
bright light, the guardian beyond it. I was taken, but my
mind...still I recognize the signs...

EARLE

There is a time ... if Jupiter and Saturn meet ... they will
receive you...
A tremor ripples through Briggs. He begins to babble.
BRIGGS
Taht mug uoy ekil si gnimoc kcab ni elyts... Taht mug

EARLE
Oh, Garland. I was hoping for a lengthy conversation.
(turning away)
Leo. Put the Major to bed. I'm afraid his mind has
begun to wander.
Leo steps to the target, removes the ropes that bind Briggs to it. Earle pauses to remember the
last words he told him.
EARLE
There is a time... if Jupiter and Saturn meet...
Earle ponders as he repeats with delight.

START ON a standing screen in the dark living room of the Hurley house. Slides projected
upon it. Just now: Nadine in wrestling garb, slamming some hapless opponent to the mat.
NADINE'S VOICE
...and this is me with last year's regional champion from
Yakima. He was cute. But a little slow. Next!
The slide changes. Nadine now appears atop a dazed opponent, a referee counts beside them,
about to slam his hand on the mat to signal "pin".

NADINE stands, peers proudly at the screen. MIKE, ED, and Norma are arrayed on the
couch behind her. All equally uncomfortable, but determined to play along. DR. JACOBY

One last slide. Nadine with an armful of trophies.

Nadine turns to the couch, beams, curtsies. Ed leads the others in polite applause.
NORMA
Congratulations, Nadine.
MIKE
(the enthusiasm of the sexually sated)
Way to go, babe!
Nadine leaps upon couch next to Mike, gives him a big kiss. She takes his hand, holds it
close to her breast. Jacoby turns on the lights, addresses the he resulting foursome.
JACOBY
(to all, but to Nadine in particular)
Thank you, Nadine. You're probably wondering why
we're gathered here today. I have found that when a
couple contemplates divor -
(catches himself)
- er, breaking up, it is sometimes. easier to talk about
our feelings in the company of others. Nadine, maybe
you would like to begin.
NADINE
Okay. Uhm. I guess it all started when I noticed
Mike's buns in the hall at school.
JACOBY
And...how are you feeling now?
NADINE
(toying with Mike's hand as she speaks)
Well. A little guilty, I guess. I mean because I'm so
happy and I worry about Ed being sad.
JACOBY

NADINE
It makes me feel like maybe it's time for us to get on
with our lives the best way we know how. And leave the
past behind us.
It's a startlingly clear-headed pronouncement. Nadine gives Mike's hand a brief, affirming
kiss. Jacoby nods approval. He turns to Ed, prods:
JACOBY
Ed? Do you have something you would like to tell
Nadine?
ED
(clears throat, takes the plunge)
Nadine. Norma and I are planning to get married.
A beat. All regard Nadine. Wait for her reaction. Finally:
NADINE
Really? That's wonderful, Eddie. 'Cause Mike and me
are getting married too.
That's news to Mike. Nadine squeezes his hand with superhuman strength. Mike's mouth opens
in a silent scream. Then he flat out HOWLS.

BEN

Is anything wrong?
AUDREY
Some creep sent me a poem. Daddy, have you seen
Jack? I called his room but nobody answered.
BEN
While you were away, I had the most incredible
brainstorm.
AUDREY
(expecting an answer, Wheeler)
What...?
BEN
(grabbing a carrot from his humidor)
The Stop Ghostwood movement needs a spokesperson,
someone with a highly visible profile to inspire our
community to action.
AUDREY
Daddy, where's Jack -?
BEN
(man on a mission)
You can do it, Audrey. As Miss Twin Peaks you can
become that spokesperson, you can use your public

Near sunset. A taxi sporting the sign "Tim and Tom's Taxidermy" and bearing a huge set of
antlers on its roof rolls up to the lone jet on the runway. A voice is heard inside the taxi:
VOICE
Straight... hold... steady... stop.
The taxi jerks to a stop in front of the jet. A piece of luggage falls to the runway, followed by
Wheeler, who pulls himself to safety from the back seat where TIM PINKLE sits. His blind
brother, TOM, sits behind the wheel in the front seat. Wheeler stares at the blind man. Tim
explains his brother.
TIM
He loves to stuff, and he loves to drive. Otherwise he
sleeps.
WHEELER
Well, I am very glad to have the opportunity to be
thankful for arriving here.
TIM
The pleasure is half mine.

voice. Naturally, I attempt to reorient myself, return to
the task at hand. But her image remains. Sometimes I
feel dizzy.

Looks to me like a man in love.

My symptoms suggest the onset of malaria. Yet I've

Cooper stands amidst the dancing couples. He gestures for Annie to join him there. Annie
demurs. But Cooper insists. He won't budge. Finally, Annie smiles, slides off the barstool,

Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to our

The microphone SQUEALS, a little puff of smoke drifts past the Mayor's nose. He looks
about, addled, taps at the mike again.
MILFORD
Damnation. Is this on...? Hello...?
The microphone is dead. A STAGEHAND scuttles into view, attempts to replace it.
Meanwhile, Annie quietly confesses, eyes straight ahead:
ANNIE
What I mean is, I understand why you treat me with
care. Why you hesitate. The convent evokes images of
helpless women fearful at the thought of emotions other
than those derived from scripture and prayer.
(choosing her words carefully)
But when you hold me, when we kiss, I feel safe and
eager. I'm not afraid. Not of anything you make me
feel. Or want.
Cooper turns to her. They kiss for a long beat. Once again, Milford intrudes:

The cluttered interior of Earle's cabin. Earle's three Queens, Audrey, Shelly, and Donna -
posted upon the wall. Briggs handcuffed to a chair, mumbling incoherently. Leo held fast by
his leg chains. Earle works feverishly, referring to the Owl Cave hieroglyph on his computer
screen, a series of maps, open books before him. The books are astrological in nature, various
charts and planetary configurations. Just now: Earle completes his computer rendering of the
Owl Cave hieroglyph.
EARLE
(giddy incantation)
If Jupiter and Saturn meet, oh what a crop of mummy
wheat...
Leo watches Earle closely. He seems more alert with each passing moment. And sympathetic
to the Major's plight. Earle addresses him, teacher to pupil, gesturing to the hieroglyph.
EARLE
The planets that our babbling Major spoke of, are more
than distant orbs. They are, in fact, a clock. A clock
that tells a time. And the time...?
Earle looks to Leo for the correct response. Leo says nothing.
EARLE
The time draws nearer with each ticking tock. Dale
wasn't far wrong, the cave painting is an invitation of
sorts, telling us when the revels begin. But what Dale
doesn't know, is where to find it.

faster and faster, the superimposition has unleashed dark magic. Earle smiles, delighted.

Then, in an instant, quite jarringly - SILENCE, a grove of trees, the air still and calm. An
eerie beat. An ARM coalesces in midair, inch by inch, now reaches about testing the cool
night, fingers prodding. The wind begins to rise. Satisfied, the arm recedes, disappears.
A beat. BOB'S disembodied HEAD follows. Fierce winds blow, shaking the trees with
mighty force. Bob's floating head peers about, now snaps back into a feral HOWL. Then Bob
VANISHES in a BLINDING FLASH OF LIGHT.
The winds recede. All is calm again. Save for the patch of SCORCHED earth below.
