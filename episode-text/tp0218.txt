ACT ONE
FADE IN:
1. INT. BOOKHOUSE - NIGHT
Truman in a cot turns restlessly in his drunken sleep. He rolls over. A naked woman snuggles
close to him. In Truman's dreams it is Josie.
TRUMAN
Josie -
Truman kisses the woman who responds. It is JONES. She moves under the sheets.
Massaging. Whispers.
JONES
Do you like that?
TRUMAN
Yes, Josie. Yes.
Jones' hands slide under him - massaging. Then she rolls over on top of Truman who responds
with passion. The wheeze of the wire from the BRACELET GAROTTE wakes Truman. She
tightens the strangle line around his neck while she sits on top of him.
Jones bends over him and kisses him passionately. Truman uses this moment to flip her off
him. But at the same time Jones pulls the magnesium wire tighter. Truman fights to breathe
and free her hands from the garotte.
ANOTHER ANGLE
Truman manages to stand. Jones wraps her legs around him. Truman tears at her trying to get a
grip. Carrying her to a wall, Truman pounds her again and again against it. Jones is nearly
unconscious. Finally, her hands drop away from him. Truman keeps pounding, about to kill
her. Then stops himself. Looks down at the naked woman lying below him.
CUT TO:
2. INT. GREAT NORTH
JOHN JUSTICE WHEELER pores over some books, maps, and in elaborate model for a
complicated irrigation system. A knock on the door.
FROM BEHIND THE DOOR
Room service.
WHEELER
It's open.
The door opens. Wheeler remains completely absorbed in what he is doing. Not noticing
that it is AUDREY HORNE who brings in his breakfast. Without looking up he retrieves a
money clip to give her a tip. Then notices it is Audrey. Surprised and pleased.

WHEELER
Audrey.
AUDREY (seductress relapse)
I trust your sleep was untroubled? Here at the Great
Northern, we aim to make your stay as comfortable and
enjoyable as we can - we take the concept of room
service very seriously -
Wheeler comes over to the bed, gently puts a finger to her lips to silence her.
WHEELER
Audrey ... did you know your grandfather?
(fingers still on her lips, becoming caress)
Colorful old guy, but the wisest man I've ever met. He
always used to say, "If you bring a hammer, you better
bring nails."
AUDREY (taking his fingers in hand)
What's that supposed to mean?
WHEELER
It means the next time you come into my room and sit
on my bed and carry on like this you had better be ready
to finish whatever it is you're trying to start.
AUDREY
Maybe I'm ready now.
WHEELER (simply)
Then be yourself.
AUDREY
This is myself.
WHEELER
You're a beautiful, intelligent, young woman. You don't
have to sneak in here and flirt like a high school girl.
Audrey fixes Wheeler with an challenging stare. Then:
AUDREY
(mimicking Wheeler)
"If you bring a hammer, you better bring nails."
(beat)
I'm not the only one who flirts.
WHEELER (beat, he smiles)
You're right. I stand corrected.

AUDREY
This could get confusing.
WHEELER
Why?
AUDREY (with humor)
Well, if I'm always worrying about being myself, and
you're always worrying, and I'm checking to see if you're
being yourself, but then you've got to keep an eye on you
too...
WHEELER
We'll be lucky if we can carry on a simple conversation.
AUDREY (her point exactly)
Yep.
WHEELER (beat, he moves closer)
Audrey, I have a plan. It involves a plane ride at sunset
and dinner for two.
AUDREY
What? When?
WHEELER
The sunset part or the dinner part?
AUDREY (she moves closer too)
I've got to go to the library, and my father wanted to
meet with me some time today -
WHEELER
If you're busy I'll understand...
AUDREY
Yes. I mean yes I'm busy. And yes I'll go.
They kiss.

3. INT. SHERIFFS STATION, INTERROGATION ROOM DAY
Truman exits the room where Jones sits at the table, meets Cooper in the hallway.
COOPER
Anything?
TRUMAN
Not a word. Wants to speak to the South African
counsulate.

3. CONTINUED:
COOPER
My guess would be there's a half-dozen countries
looking to extradite her.
TRUMAN
Why would Eckhardt want me dead?
COOPER
Sexual jealousy.
TRUMAN
(as if he hadn't considered it)
Oh yeah.
COOPER
You think he needed a more rational reason? It's good
to have you back, Harry.
TRUMAN
(a hell of a hangover)
Take me a day or so to get my sea legs.
COOPER
To be honest, Harry you look like hell. Maybe you
ought to recuperate at home.
TRUMAN
All I need's some coffee and maybe some food.
Cooper stops him.
COOPER
Sure cure for a hangover, Harry. You start with a nearly
frozen, unstrained glass of tomato juice. Drop a couple
of oysters in there and chug it down. Breathe deeply.
Next a heaping mound of sauteed sweetbreads with
chestnuts and Canadian bacon. Finally some biscuits and
a bucket of gravy, and here's where it gets tricky, you're
gonna need some anchovies -
Truman, growing green, stops him outside the men's room door.
TRUMAN
Excuse me.
Truman rushes into the bathroom. Cooper, having acheived the desired stomach-pump effect,
gives a thumbs-up.

4. INT. TRUMAN'S OFFICE - DAY
Cooper enters to find DOC HAYWARD admiring a BONSAI TREE that sits on Truman's
desk. A bow is wrapped around the base of the plant.
DOC
Multi-trunk bonsai. The ultimate miniature.
A shakey Truman enters a moment later, Cooper hands him a glass.
COOPER
Bicarbonate of soda.
TRUMAN
Thanks. Where'd this come from?
Truman takes the card from the plant. Reads it. Grows even paler.
COOPER
It was delivered this morning.
TRUMAN
It's from Josie.
Truman sits down trying to hold onto his composure. To Cooper, Doc indicates the package that
Windom Earle left at his house, which Cooper has already seen. Cooper gets the message: involve
Harry. He urges Doc to speak.
DOC
Harry, Windom Earle was at my house.
TRUMAN
Windom Earle was?
DOC
He left this with Donna.
Truman takes out a chess piece that is tagged with a chess move. It reads "Kn to KB3."
Another note reads "Trying for a Stalemate?"
TRUMAN
What do we do?
COOPER
We've got to publish our next move today.
COLE'S VOICE
DALE COOPER, A SIGHT FOR SORE EYES IF EVER
THERE WAS ONE. GIMME THE GLAD HAND.
Gordon Cole moves into the room.

COLE
HEY, FELLAS. I BROUGHT THE REST OF THE
WINDOM EARLE DOSSIER.
He hands Cooper a large folder. As Cole continues we MOVE IN on the Bonsai plant.
Closer and closer till an ELECTRONIC BUG is visible.
INTERCUT:
5. INT. EARLE'S CABIN - DAY
WINDOM EARLE fiddles with a deck of cards, as he sits and listens to the conversation.
LEO JOHNSON, filthy rag over his arm ala a butler, pours Earle a drink from a can of beer.
EARLE
Enter Gordon Cole. This is so galling, Leo. Young
Dale is continually refusing to play fair.
INTERCUT:
TRUMAN'S OFFICE
As Cooper flips through Earle's file, Cole narrates.
COOPER
Medical report?
COLE
WHEN EARLE WENT BOY - YOY - YOING THE
DOCTORS DISCOVERED HE WAS ON
HALOPERIDOL.
DOC
The drug the one armed man, Gerard, was on.
COLE
YOU GOT IT. BUT THEY SUSPECT HE WAS
USING IT TO FAKE HIS ILLNESS. DEFINITE
SCHIZOID MANEUVERING.
Cooper stares at the next file. Flipping a page back and forth. Confused and fearful.
COOPER
"Project Blue Book." How could he have been working on that..?
COLE
WE LOANED HIM OUT TO THE AIR FORCE
IN '65. REPORTS ON HIS TWO-YEAR HITCH
ARE BLACKED OUT. NATIONAL SECURITY.
TRUMAN (picking up on Cooper's concern)
Wait a minute, Earle was investigating UFO's?

Another worry for the group.
COOPER
Some curious linkages here, Gordon.
COLE
THE WORD LINKAGE REMINDS ME OF
SAUSAGES. NEVER LIKED LINK SAUSAGES,
THOUGH. PREFER PATTIES. BREAKFAST IS
A GOOD IDEA.
(moves to the plant)
BONSAI. REMEMBER THOSE WORLD WAR
TWO MOVIES?
(right next to the plant)
BONSAI.
EARLE'S CABIN
Cole's yelling has buried the needle. The cards shoot out of Earle's hands. He brings his hands
to his ears.
EARLE
Damnation.
TRUMAN'S OFFICE
Doc and Truman exit. Cole watches them go. Pulls Cooper back and gives him a package.
Cooper reaches into the package. He takes out his BADGE, GUN, and CREDENTIALS.
COLE
KEEP THIS ON THE QT, COOP, BUT WITH
EARLE ROLLING AROUND LOOSE ON DECK,
WE NEED YOU BACK ON THE TEAM.
(Cooper looks at the gun)
BRAND NEW ISSUE. MORE ACCURATE AND
EFFICIENT. SMITH AND WESSON, TEN
MILLIMETER. MOD 1076. ALL STAINLESS
STEEL. IT'S QUITE A BEAUTIFUL WEAPON.
COOPER
(takes out his badge, studies it)
Thank you, Gordon.
COLE
WE'RE GOING TO FIND EARLE, COOP. WE
WILL PURSUE, CAPTURE, AND
INCARCERATE.
Cooper peers at Cole for a beat. Then, quite serious, gives him the Bureau thumb's up.

6. INT. EARLE'S CABIN - DAY
Earle shuffles a deck of cards in front of Leo, then spreads them before him.
Pick three cards, Leo.
Leo picks cards out of the deck. Earle flips the cards over. THREE QUEENS. On the faces
are pictures of DONNA, SHELLY, and AUDREY.
EARLE
Good. Now find the king.
Leo picks another card and flips it over. A king is there with Cooper's face glued on it.
EARLE
And now we need one more Queen.
Earle picks out a Queen without a face.
EARLE
The Queen of Hearts.
He picks up a brochure for the MISS TWIN PEAKS CONTEST.
EARLE
Miss Twin Peaks. What do you get if you win. A
dozen roses, a college scholarship, the accolades of your
peers...
(picks up the queen without a face)
Oh and I know you got to die. A royal execution.
Earle spreads the rest of the deck out.
EARLE
And Cooper gets to watch.
Flips them all over on their faces. They are all JOKERS.

The parking lot. A van pulls up. A ramp lowers. EILEEN HAYWARD wheels herself away
from the van.
Some distance away, Donna watches from the driver's seat of a car. She gets out and follows
her mother.

8. INT. GREAT NORTHERN LOBBY/CORRIDOR - DAY
Eileen wheels through the lobby and down the tile corridor. Donna follows at a distance. Stops
and moves out of sight when she sees BEN HORNE greet her at the far end of the corridor.
He helps move her around the corner out of sight.
Donna wonders.

9. INT. GREAT NORTHERN LOBBY - DAY
NADINE HURLEY with MIKE NELSON are checking out. He's got the blissful, glazed
look of a sexual train wreck victim. Nadine holds onto his arm.
DESK CLERK
How was everything sir?
MIKE
Unbelievable.
Donna comes up to the desk.
DONNA
Is Audrey Horne here?
DESK CLERK
She's in back, I'll get her for you.

Hi, Donna.

Donna watches this curious exit, when Audrey appears in front of her.
AUDREY
Donna?
DONNA
(indicating a need for privacy)
Hi, can I talk to you for a second?
AUDREY
Sure.
They move away.
DONNA
I feel kind of funny asking you this.
AUDREY
What?
DONNA
Do you know any reason why my mom would be visiting
your dad?
AUDREY
Not off hand.
DONNA
He came to see her yesterday at the house. And today
she drove here to see him.
AUDREY
Maybe she's helping with the Stop Ghostwood campaign.
DONNA
If she was she'd have said something to me and she hasn't
said a word.
AUDREY
(a mischevious look)
Is she here now?
DONNA
I think they're in his office together. Why?

Eileen and Ben Horne are in the middle of a heated discussion. She's trying to give him a
small packet.
BEN
- no, I won't accept them, they're yours, they were
written to you -
EILEEN
I don't want them. I won't have them in the house any
longer.
BEN
You've kept them twenty years, why now?
EILEEN
I'm asking you the same question: why now? All you'll
succeed in doing is ripping apart old wounds. I can't
bear the thought of it.
She's nearly overcome. He tries to comfort her.
BEN
Eileen, Eileen, why won't you believe me?
EILEEN
Words aren't good enough.
BEN
I want my actions to speak for me. Haven't you been
listening? I've been wrong all this time, I'm trying to
make up for it -
EILEEN
Sometimes making up for something only makes it
worse.
BEN
Have you told her?
EILEEN
God no. No and I never will. You must promise me the

EILEEN

Take them. Please.
Pause. He does.
EILEEN (CONTINUED)
You mustn't call. You mustn't come to the house again.
BEN
I understand.
EILEEN
I should hope you do. Goodbye, Ben.
BEN
Goodbye.
Eileen wheels herself towards the door. Ben moves to help her. They move out of sight.

HANGOVER WAS RAW MEAT AND PLENTY

AND WORCHESTERSHIRE SAUCE.
TRUMAN
(growing green again)
I'll be right with you guys.
COLE
IF YOU WANT WE CAN ORDER SOME UP FOR
YOU.
Truman heads for the bathroom again. The others sit in a booth. Most of the diner is
listening.
COLE
NOW THAT I COME TO MENTION IT, YOU
KNOW WHAT I'M IN THE MOOD FOR? A
STEAK SO RARE YOU COULD SELL IT AT
TIFFANY'S.
COOPER
Gordon, you've come to the right place.
SHELLY JOHNSON appears behind the counter. Gordon spots her.
COLE
HOLY SMOKES, WHO IS THAT?
COOPER
(in his ear)
Her name's Shelly Johnson.
COLE
WHAT A BEAUTY. REMINDS ME OF THAT
STATUE, THE BABE WITHOUT THE ARMS.

Cole sits near her.
COLE
HELLO. I'M WONDERING IF I MIGHT
TROUBLE YOU FOR A CUP OF STRONG
BLACK COFFEE AND IN THE PROCESS
ENGAGE YOU WITH AN ANECDOTE OF NO
SMALL AMUSEMENT.
She smiles. Looks over at Cooper, who gives her an OK sign.
COLE
THE NAME'S GORDON COLE AND I
COULDN'T HELP BUT NOTICE YOU FROM
THE BOOTH AND WELL, I SUDDENLY FEEL
LIKE I HAVE A BELLY FULL OF SPIROKEETS.
SHELLY

You don 't have to shout, sir, I can hear you perfectly
well.
COLE
I HEARD THAT.
(occurs to him that he did)
I HEARD THAT.
SHELLY
Would you like anything besides coffee?
COLE

SHELLY
Yes I do.
COLE
I've spent the last twenty years asking folks to speak up,
but for some weird reason I can hear you clear as a bell.
(takes out his hearing aids)
Say something else.
SHELLY
Would you like some pie with your coffee?
COLE
Good Lord, I can hear every word you say. This is
some kind of a miracle, a-a-a phenomenom.
The LOG LADY, who has been sitting at the counter, chimes in.
LOG LADY
My log thinks the cherry pie is a miracle as well.
COLE
(can't hear her)
WHAT'S THAT?
SHELLY
The cherry pie.
COLE
I heard you. I heard you again.
SHELLY
So would you like some pie?
COLE
Massive. Massive quantities. And a glass of water,
sweetheart, my socks are on fire.
COLE sits there with an absolute grin.

Cooper turns back to see Annie smiling at him.
COOPER
Hi.
ANNIE
Hi. Coffee?
COOPER
For me.
TRUMAN
What's good for a hangover?
ANNIE
Teetotaling and prayer.
COOPER
(grins)
Good answer.
ANNIE
(good-humored)
Anyway, a cure might make you feel better and you're
supposed to suffer for your sins, remember?
TRUMAN
(lying)
That's a great comfort to me. I'll try coffee.
COOPER
How are you today?
ANNIE
I'm fine. Actually, I'm weird. I'm disoriented. I'm
not sure where I am exactly. I mean I know but it feels
odd, being here. I'm okay.

Gosh, listen to me, I've been out of circulation so long
I've completely forgotten about social niceties. I mean,
you ask me how I am, I'm not really supposed to say how
I am, I'm supposed to say, "I'm fine, thanks, how are you?"
Cooper smiles. He likes her a lot and he can't hide it.
ANNIE
You must think I'm really strange.
COOPER
Not at all.
ANNIE
But I mean, with due consideration to the social niceties,
even if I asked you and you did think I was strange, you
wouldn't say so, would you?
COOPER
If I thought you were strange, I would tell you.
ANNIE
And you don't. Think so.
COOPER
Not for a second.
Truman's been watching this like a ping-pong match.
ANNIE
Okay. Good. Glad we cleared that up. So. What'll
you have?
TRUMAN
Chicken pot pie. And a glass of milk.
ANNIE
Good choice. All the major food groups represented.
COOPER
Turkey sandwhich. Whole wheat. Lettuce. A hair of
mayonaise. And I've got a joke for you: a couple of
penguins are walking across an iceberg and the first one

Wait, I'll be right back.
COOPER
I wasn't quite finished.
Pause.
TRUMAN (his turn for prescience)
How long have you been in love with her?
COOPER
Who said anything about love?
TRUMAN
Coop, you just tried to tell her a joke.
Cooper is nailed. Maybe Truman's right. Not sure what to say. Annie comes back.
ANNIE
Okay, what did the second penguin say?
COOPER
(resuming with enthusiasm)
The first one says, "You look like you're wearing a
tuxedo." And the second one says, "Maybe I am."
TRUMAN
(after a millenium passes)
The defense rests.
ANNIE
That was cute.
COOPER
Thank you.

Funny. Looks like the rocks in Owl Cave.
She moves off. Cooper watches her go, a little moonstruck. Another look at the napkin, then
Cooper snaps back on the beam.
COOPER
Owl Cave? What's Owl Cave?
TRUMAN
It's up near Pearl Lakes. Old Indian territory.
Supposed to be sacred ground. We used to go there
when we were kids.

My God it does. It does look like it.

Sounds like we better go there now.

Donna steps through the living room, leafing through a handful of afternoon mail. She stops
suddenly, stares at a postcard, SAN FRANCISCO emblazoned across a rendering of the
Golden Gate bridge. Donna turns the card over, reads. We HEAR:
JAMES' VOICE
Dear Donna. You were right. I had to go. Everything
feels different when you're on the road. It feels better.
San Francisco is really cool. Next stop, Mexico. I'll be
back with a million stories. Promise. I love you, James.
Donna looks up, tearful. DOC HAYWARD enters the room, sees the postcard in her hands.
HAYWARD
James? How is he?
DONNA
He's good. He's doing what he needed to do.
Hayward putters with at the table. Donna watches him for a beat.
DONNA
Dad? Can I ask you something?
HAYWARD
Sure.
DONNA
How does Mom know Ben Horne?
Hayward tries to hide the jolt her question brings. He looks into his daughter's eyes, and lies.
HAYWARD
I doubt that she does, Donna. Not very well.
DONNA
(knows he's lying)
But he was over here yesterday. They were talking like
old friends.
HAYWARD

Your mother works with the local charities. I'm sure
even Ben contributes once in a while.

DONNA
I don't think so.
HAYWARD
... yes, that's it. Eileen mentioned it to me at breakfast.
One of those Heal The Planet things.
DONNA
She never said anything about it to me.
HAYWARD
(very firm, end of discussion)
Well that's exactly what it is. Your mother told me so.
Donna pauses, uncertain. Just then: the doorbell RINGS.
DONNA
I'll get it.
Donna steps to the door, off-screen. Hayward watches his daughter with evident concern.
When Donna returns, she holds a bouquet of flowers in her arms.
DONNA
They're for Mom. No card.
HOLD ON Donna for a beat. A blossom for every lie her father told her.

18. INT. TWIN PEAKS CITY LIBRARY - DAY
Audrey walks between dark library stacks, thinking about Wheeler, energized. She mounts a
short ladder, inspects a row of dusty books. She removes one, leafs through it, eyes seeking
pertinent information. Audrey begins to read, when ... SUDDENLY a footfall, Audrey looks
up. A man stands close by in the shadows. Startled, Audrey nearly tips the ladder. But the
quick-handed stranger grabs and steadies it.
STRANGER
Sorry. My fault.
AUDREY
It's okay. I didn't hear you coming...

STRANGER
One should never allow both mind and foot to wander at

AUDREY
(pleased to meet a fellow seeker)
Audrey Horne. Pleased to meet you, Mister Perkins.
ANOTHER ANGLE reveals that she is shaking the hand of Windom Earle. He is dressed as a
absent-minded academic. Trousers, shirt, cardigan sweater, wire-rim glasses. He eyes
Audrey closely throughout, just short of rudeness, as if measuring her for some future use.
EARLE
What brings you to the library?
AUDREY
Research. On civil disobedience.
EARLE
Good for you. It is incumbent on the young to disobey.
AUDREY
Are you a professor?
EARLE
I teach. Poetry is my area of expertise.
AUDREY
You're kidding. Someone sent me a poem. Wait.
She reaches into her jacket, pulls out the poem Windom sent to his three queens, now taped
together. She holds it out for him to inspect. But Earle quietly demurs.
EARLE
You read it.
AUDREY
(after a beat)
See the montains kiss high Heaven
And the waves clasp one another,
No sister flower would be forgiven
If it disdained its brother;
And the sunlight clasps the earth
And the moonbeams kiss the sea...
EARLE (interjecting)
What is this sweet work worth
If thou kiss not me?

Yes ... you know it.
EARLE
Oh yes. Shelly.
Earle says it softly, wistful. He peers at Audrey with an intense expression. She wonders:
AUDREY
What ...?
EARLE
Gazing at you, perched on that ladder, reciting Shelly's
verse ... you look very much like a Queen.
AUDREY
(a little spooked)
Oh. Thanks. Well. I better go.
(descends, means to walk away)
Nice to meet you Mr. Perkins.
EARLE
(simply)
Perhaps we'll meet again someday.
Earle watches Audrey carry her book into the shadows.

19. INT. SHERIFF'S STATION - DAY
Cooper leads Andy and Hawk through the station. The deputies carry armloads of equipment
- safety helmets, flashlights, pick-axes and rope. LUCY MORAN sits at her post, watches
them pass. She sees Andy and sighs. He looks bold, dashing, ready for adventure.
LUCY
Andy?
Andy lingers. Cooper and Hawk continue to the Sheriff's office.
ANDY
Yes, Lucy?
LUCY
I want to thank you for helping out during the Weasel
Riot yesterday which is more than I can say for a certain
Dick we both know.

Where are you going with all of that gear?
ANDY
Spelunking.
LUCY
Is it dangerous, spelunking?
ANDY
Sometimes.
LUCY
Promise me something?
ANDY
Okay.
LUCY
I know you'll be strong. And I know you'll be brave.
But I want you to promise me you'll be careful.
ANDY
(never more manly)
I'll be careful, Lucy. You have my word.
HOLD ON them for a beat. Love rekindled, or nearly so.
CUT TO:
20. INT. SHERIFF TRUMAN'S OFFICE - DAY
Truman peers down at the chess board as if to visualize the battle Cooper and Earle are
fighting there. He reaches out to touch a piece when the door to his office OPENS. Truman,
still suffering from a world class hangover, turns to face Cooper as he enters.
TRUMAN
Pete just called in our next move.
Truman hands a piece of paper to Cooper. Cooper reads it, steps to the board, moves the
appropriate piece. He considers the resulting formation.
COOPER
We expose a pawn to his bishop.

Want me to hold off?
COOPER
No. If he takes the pawn he'll forfeit the bishop and
most of his initial advantage. Feeling any better, Harry?
TRUMAN
Like someone pounded a railroad spike into my ear.
COOPER
Then a descent into a cool, subteranean cave may be just
what the doctor ordered.
Cooper tosses the helmet to Truman. He catches it cleanly.

22. INT. DOUBLER DINER - DAY
The diner is quiet, nearly empty. Annie cleans the counter, pauses to retrieve a flyer. It
reads: THE MISS TWIN PEAKS PAGEANT, our Twentieth Anniversary. Shelly steps into
view, reads it over Annie's shoulder.
SHELLY
Thinking of entering?
ANNIE
I think the real world's strange enough without getting up
on stage and parading around in a bathing suit and heels'
SHELLY
Guess they're not too big on that kind of stuff in the
convent.
ANNIE
That's a good guess.
SHELLY
Is it strange, you know, being back in civilization?
ANNIE
(a little defensive)
It wasn't as if they kept us locked up in the attic. We
had newspapers. We even had cable TV. Every time I
tell someone where I've been they act like I'm out on
parole.

ANNIE
(pause, trying to sound idle)
What do you know about Agent Cooper?
SHELLY
(gentle teasing)
Are you interested?
ANNIE
(in kind)
It's like anthropology. Examing the native flora and
fauna. For educational purposes
SHELLY
Uh-huh.
ANNIE
So. Tell me about him.
NORMA
Okay. He's a few years older than you. Handsome, but
not too handsome. He's really, really smart. He's in the
FBI. He loves Twin Peaks. He loves pie and coffee.
And trees.
ANNIE
(deadpan)
Good. Now I won't have to send to Washington for his
file.
SHELLY
And judging from the look on his face when he saw you
today, I'd say you have a major opporunity.

Who said anything about that?
Shelly walks away, with a knowing smile.

Ben paces, taking bites from a carrot. Audrey, sits upon the office sofa, looks on with an
admiring smile.
BEN
Audrey, when Jack Kennedy entered the White House, he
took his brother with him, because he trusted Bobby to
tell him the truth even when it wasn't pretty. When the
Bay of Pigs went up in smoke, Bobby was there. When
the Russians moved missiles into Fidel's backyard,
Bobby helped his brother shoulder through.
AUDREY
Sort of like Jerry's been for you?
BEN
(moving closer)
The unvarnished truth is what I am looking for. I
believe you are the best man for the job.
AUDREY
(surprise and delight)
Me?
Ben kneels down before her, pauses. This is a new Ben. This comes straight from the heart.
BEN
Audrey, I haven't always been a good father to you. Oh,
hell, who am I kidding? When was I ever anything but a
sleazy rapacious heel?
AUDREY (moved)
Well. When I was little, maybe... I...
Audrey shrugs. Ben lived a life devoid of any and all goodness.

Won't you help me? Please?
AUDREY (through her tears)
Daddy, I'm your man.
A warm beat. Ben rises, beaming.
BEN
Sensational. Audrey, pack a bag get out to the
airport. Your plane leaves in an hour.
AUDREY
(from tears to confusion)
My plane?
BEN
(looking off)
John! Just the man I want to see.
John Wheeler pauses in the open doorway, enters. Audrey turns to meet his gaze, remembers
their plans for this evening. Her plane?!
AUDREY
Daddy, I...
WHEELER
Hello, Ben.
BEN
Audrey, you'd better get moving. One hour.
(to Wheeler)
Audrey's flying to Seattle tonight. She's having a
breakfast confab with the Sierra Club. We're going

cannot say to Ben just yet. Or to each other.
AUDREY
(collecting her thoughts)
I'd better go.
(glances at Wheeler, a helpless shrug)
Goodbye.
WHEELER
(sotto voce)
Goodbye.
Ben, unaware, wraps his daughter in a big farewell hug.
BEN
Bless you, Audrey. Safe passage.
Audrey takes one last look at Wheeler and walks out the door. A beat. And Ben slumps
down on the sofa with a mighty sigh.
WHEELER
What's wrong, Ben?
BEN
I am filled to the brim with goodness. Like a
Christmas tree all lit up inside me. But at the end of the
day, when I look in the mirror, I have to face the fact
that I don't really know how to be good.
WHEELER
(sitting down beside him)
You're off to a pretty fair start.
BEN
How do you do it, John? What's your secret? Can I learn
to be good too?

I don't see why not. Keep an eye on your heart. Always

WHEELER

Yes, jack?
WHEELER
I'm falling in love with your daughter.
BEN
Now there's a hard truth.
WHEELER
It is the truth.
BEN
It is?
WHEELER
Yes.
A long beat. Ben pats Wheeler on the knee. Father to son.
BEN

Ahh, Jack. What a wonderful world we live in.
HOLD ON Ben and Wheeler for a beat. Side by side upon the sofa. Ben offers Wheeler a
carrot. Wheeler accepts.

25. EXT. OWL CAVE - NIGHT
Two police vehicles parked in the dark, their lights shining brightly upon the rock formations
that enclose Owl Cave.
CUT TO:
26. INT. OWL CAVE - NIGHT
START CLOSE on a pair of gloved hands desperately seeking purchase on a rocky wall.
Flashlight beams illuminate the scene. Encouraging voices are HEARD:
TRUMAN, COOPER, HAWK
That's it, Andy. Careful. One hand at a time.
CAMERA PULLS back to reveal Andy's head pressed against the wall, grimacing with effort,
and not a little afraid. He grunts, hand over hand, as Truman and the others shout instructions
from below. Then, finally, with one last moan ... Andy sinks out of frame like a stone.
Andy lands with a thud on the floor of Owl Cave. Flashlight beams criss-cross his features as
Cooper, Truman, and Hawk huddle about him
COOPER
Are you all right?
ANDY
(determined to be the man of action)
I'm fine.
They part, help Andy to his feet. And turn their lights on the interior of the cave. It is a large,
airy space filled with rocky outcroppings, strange shapes in the dark.
COOPER
Incredible.
As the beams of light trip across the cave walls, Hawk intones:
HAWK
We used to play here when I was a kid. Pretend it was
haunted by fierce ghosts.
Truman kicks something in the dark, picks it up. A beer can.
TRUMAN
(deadpan)
Beer drinkers, by the look of it.

26. CONTINUED:
COOPER
(fascinated by every detail)
Where is the symbol?
HAWK
This way.
Hawk swings his flashlight beam across the cave, illuminates the far wall. And a ROCKY
SHAPE upon it. Cooper and Truman aim their beams as well, step closer.
COOPER
Yes ...
The rocky symbol is a rough-hewn rendering of Cooper's drawing. An easily discernable shape
extruding from the cave wall. It does not appear to be man-made.
COOPER
(to self)
Two symbols combined into a larger whole. But for
what purpose?
TRUMAN
(the skeptic)
I don't know, Coop. It's similar, there's no denying that.
COOPER
It's more than similar, Harry. The tattoos are a
question. And this, somehow, is the answer.
Andy listens gravely, pick-axe over his shoulder, afraid. He flashes his light upon the symbol,
forces himself a little closer. As if determined to contribute despite his fears.
COOPER
Why do they call it Owl Cave?
SUDDENLY: an owl's SHRIEK to wake the dead, the FLAPPING of enormous wings,
something passes through the shadows overhead. Several things happen simultaneously:
Cooper, Hawk, and Truman whip their flashlights toward the passing sounds, but find nothing.
Andy yips, panics, and whirls about. His pick-axe STRIKING the cave symbol with a
mighty blow. Rocks chip and tumble, a sort of whooshing rumble is heard ... and a small
LANDSLIDE tumbles down upon his head.
TRUMAN
Andy!
All rush to his side, claw through the rocks and detritus. Andy lays beneath, bruised, stunned,
but essentially unharmed.

An owl.
ANDY
I'm sorry. I destroyed a national monument.
TRUMAN
Forget it, Andy. It's just a rock. The important thing -
(notices Cooper's expression)
Coop?
Cooper isn't listening. He's shining his light on the cave wall, the section revealed by the slide.
His eyes are filled with wonder.
TRUMAN
What is it?
COOPER
I'm not sure.
Cooper steps forward, their beams join his to illuminate the wall. And there, partially
obscured by the rock that remains, is a CAVE PAINTING of startling color and design.
TRUMAN
Good God.
(reaching out to touch it)
It appears to be a hieroglyph. We'll need the proper
tools to excavate. Harry, I have no idea where this will
lead us. But I have a feeling, a definite feeling, it will
be a place both wonderful and strange.
Cooper reaches out to touch the mysterious design. HOLD ON the cave painting for a beat.
The rocky formation that once hid it from view.

COOPER
Diane. Wednesday night, late. Have just returned from from
a place called Owl Cave. How I got there is a long and
complicated story, but I will try to recount it
accurately. It all began with a pair of matching
tattoos...
Cooper stops, looks off. He sees someone familiar in the dining room/bar.
CUT TO:
29. INT. GREAT NORTHERN BAR - NIGHT
Annie Blackburne enters and sits alone at the bar, curious, uncertain. Will she ever be a part of
this world? Annie raises an arm, tentative, to flag the bartender. Her actions are not those of
someone timid or shy. But rather the first halting steps of a stranger new to a strange land.

I'd like something to drink. I'm not exactly sure what.
BARTENDER
Ladies seem to like rum.
ANNIE
Rum. I'll have one, please. With...?
BARTENDER
Tonic.
The bartender steps off to fetch and pour. Annie turns her eyes back to the smokey room:
couples seated at tables, talking, intimate and close. Annie watches with fascination and
regret. A familiar VOICE penetrates her reverie. Agent Cooper.
COOPER
Hello, Annie.
ANNIE
Hi.
COOPER
Could I get you...
Annie notices the bartender has left her a cocktail.
ANNIE
No, thank you. I have rum and tonic.
COOPER
I see.
ANNIE
One of the Sister's put rum in her tea. I've never tasted it
before, but it sounds exotic. so I ...
(off his look)
I lived in a convent for five years. I might as well be
from Mars.
COOPER
You're doing fine. You're here, on your own. And you
have rum and tonic.
Cooper speaks with quiet humor and affection. Just the support Annie needs. She smiles
appreciatively, lifts the glass to her lips, takes a drink. Reacts curiously. Not unpleasant.

Cooper watches her gazing at the room, the wonder and doubt in her eyes. Annie senses him
watching her, Cooper wonders:
COOPER
It's all new to you. Everything.
ANNIE
I feel constantly amazed ... stunned. Music, people.
The way they laugh and talk. Some of them so clearly
in love. It's like a foreign language to me. I know just
enough of the words to realize how little I understand.
COOPER
I'd like to see the world through your eyes.
ANNIE
Why?
COOPER
There are things I would do differently if I had the
chance to start over again.
ANNIE
Me too.
Annie pauses, as if to consider a painful memory. She reaches for her glass of water, her sleeve
slips up, reveals scars on her wrist. Cooper sees it, says nothing. But Annie knows he saw them.
ANNIE
The thing is, I've failed before. I'm afraid I might fail
again.
COOPER
Do you want to talk about it?
ANNIE
(simply, without rancor)
Not yet.
A beat. Cooper peers at Annie, feels something turn inside his heart. He falls in love.
COOPER
Can I help you, Annie?

Can you?

Show you the world. Will you let me?

I can't promise you I'd always make sense, or do the
things you expect me to.
COOPER
I don't expect anything.
ANNIE

Then I accept your kind and generous offer.
Cooper smiles in kind, reaches out to touch Annie's hand and hold it, just below the scars. He's
wanted to touch her from the first moment they met.
