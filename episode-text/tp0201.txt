Looking through the open door into Cooper's room. COOPER lies still on the floor, flat on
his back at the foot of the bed.
Looking down the corridor, here comes a ROOM SERVICE WAITER, carrying a glass of
warm milk on a tray. He stops at the open doorway, sees Cooper, knocks.
WAITER
Room service.
No response. He enters cautiously.
Cooper's eyes open. He looks up as the Waiter, who is no scholar.
WAITER (CONTINUED)
(grins)
How you doin' down there?
Cooper blinks a few times, dazed and disoriented. Pause.
WAITER (CONTINUED)
Warm milk.
He proudly holds up the glass.
COOPER
(finding his voice)
Could you ... put it on the table?
WAITER
Sure.
The Waiter gingerly steps around him and sets the glass of milk down on the table beside the
phone receiver, from where he hears ...
ANDY'S VOICE
Hello? ... Agent Cooper? ... Agent Cooper?
The Waiter looks down at Cooper, then decides to helpfully hang up the receiver.

2. CONTINUED:
WAITER
Hung it up for you.
COOPER
What's that?
WAITER
Hung it up. The phone.
COOPER
Oh.
(pause)
Thank you.
WAITER
No problem.
The Waiter stands in front of him, holding the bill, takes out a pen. Cooper's attention drifts
off him, drifts back.
COOPER
Yes?
The Waiter holds out the bill and pen. Cooper takes them, holds them above his chest, trying
to focus
COOPER (CONTINUED)
Does this include a gratuity?
WAITER
Yes sir.
Cooper scrawls a signature. The Waiter takes back the bill and pen.
WAITER (CONTINUED)
That milk'll cool down on ya'.
The Waiter smiles, backs up to the door, stops, grins, points a finger. He's figured it out.
WAITER
I heard about you.
Cooper looks at him. The Waiter grins again, gives a small wave and a wink and moves off.
We hear his footsteps move do, the coorridor. They stop. Slower footsteps come back.
The Waiter peeks around the corner, looks at Cooper again, grins, shakes his head and
moves off. The footsteps recede.

Cooper takes a cautious deep breath. He closes his eyes, wincing in pain. He turns his head
towards the bed, opens his eyes and slowly realizes that, looming above him, a GIANT is
sitting on the foot of the bed looking down at him.
The Giant appears to be at least eight feet tall. He's wearing dark pants, a white shirt rolled
up at the sleeves and a slender black tie.
GIANT
I will tell you three things.
(pause)
If I tell them to you, and they come true, then will you
believe me?
COOPER
Who are you?
GIANT
Think of me as a friend.
COOPER
Where did you come from?
GIANT
(shakes his head)
The question is: where have you gone?
Cooper blinks, ponders.
GIANT (CONTINUED)
The first thing I will tell you is: "The man in the
smiling bag."
COOPER
(mumbles to himself, trying, to remember)
"Smiling bag."
GIANT
The second thing is: "The owls are not what you think."
Cooper repeats the words, clinging to them.
GIANT(CONTINUED)
The third thing is: "He points without the proper chemical."
Cooper repeats the phrase to himself.

COOPER
What, what does this mean?
GIANT
This is all I am permitted to say. If you find these
things to be true, I will visit you again. We want to help
you.
COOPER
Who's "we?"
GIANT
One last thing: Leo locked inside a hungry horse. By the
way, you will require medical attention.
Cooper looks down at his shirt. A bloodstain is slowly spreading across his midsection. He
looks back. The Giant is gone. Cooper doesn't move.
COOPER
Holy jumpin' George.

CUT TO:
4. INT. ONE-EYED JACK'S BEDROOM NIGHT
CLOSE on AUDREY'S eye, peering out from between the curtains, draped around the
fourposter in her room. Audrey stands on the bed. There are two masks on the wall above
the headboard.
BEN HORNE enters the room, sees movement behind the curtains.
BEN
Knock, knock.
(pause)
Knock. Knock.
AUDREY
(changing her voice)
Who's there?
BEN
The big bad wolf.
(CONTINUED)

4. CONTINUED:
AUDREY
Go away.
BEN
Interesting.
(takes a moment)
Come on, let's have a look at you.
AUDREY
I'm shy.
BEN
Didn't you know? Everybody's shy. Here at One-Eyed
Jack's it's a transitory condition. And an occupational
handicap.
He tries to pry the curtain apart for a look, she snaps it shut. He takes out a cigar; having
been through this before, he falls back on technique.
BEN (CONTINUED)
But, consider; your first night in a new place, new
surroundings, new people -
AUDREY
New wardrobe -
BEN
(warming to the task)
- naturally you are full of questions, anxieties. You're
wondering "What's expected of me? how will I be
received? will they ... like me?" I'm right, aren't I?
AUDREY
Yes.
Ben patrols the perimeter, toying with the curtains, as she moves with him, defending her
translucent barrier, trying to anticipate his angle of attack.
BEN
Let's examine these feelings, shall we? What are they if
not the natural emotional processes of any living,
breathing person who finds herself thrust ... into new
circumstances?
AUDREY
(pause)
Could you repeat the question?
(CONTINUED)
6.
4. CONTINUED:(2)
BEN
You're nervous, you're shy, you're frightened: of course
you are...
(another thought)
How exactly new to all this are you?
AUDREY
You might say ... brand new.
BEN
(the thought cheers him)
Really.
AUDREY
For instance, if I was a bar of soap, I'd still be wrapped
in my package.
BEN
(enthusiasm swells)
Alright' fine, now I have to see you ...
He puts his cigar in his mouth, tries to open the curtain again; she thwarts him. He thrusts a
hand inside. She slaps it away.
BEN (CONTINUED)
(happy)
A vixen! What's your name?
AUDREY
Queen of Diamonds.
BEN
No, no, no, your real name.
AUDREY
I'm not supposed to tell.
BEN
Did they tell you who I was?
AUDREY
The owner?
BEN
That's right. Tell me your name.
AUDREY
You wouldn't believe me.
(CONTINUED)
7.
4. CONTINUED:(3)
BEN
I'm a liberal thinker.
AUDREY
Prudence.
BEN
Prudence!
AUDREY
I think you should go.
BEN
Do you, Prudence?
AUDREY
Yes I do. I really do.
BEN
(pause)
All right.
She listens cautiously. Ben walks to the door, opens and closes it, tiptoes back into the room,
towards the bed. He triumphantly throws the curtains open.
BEN (CONTINUED)
'Got you!
She's hiding under the covers, a conspicuous lump. Ben advances.
BEN (CONTINUED)
I'll huff ... and I'll puff ... and I'll blow your house
down!
He yanks the covers away. She's revealed: a mask covers her features.
BEN (CONTINUED)
Aren't you ... something?
He advances further. She retreats. He reaches for her, she slaps his hands away, grabs a
pillow and whacks him across the head. He laughs. She's backed against the wall. He reaches
for her mask.
BEN (CONTINUED)
Please ... I have to ... see you ...
His hand reaches the mask. An urgent knock at the door. Ben hesitates. Another knock.

JERRY HORNE'S VOICE
Ben, it's Jer! Brother Ben, we've got a situation!
BEN
So have I.
JERRY HORNE'S VOICE
Ben, it's the M-I-L-L! And we got a big S-N-A-G!
Ring a bell?
BEN
(to Audrey)
Alas, I do have a situation.
AUDREY
Gee, that's too bad.
BEN
(all business, rising, putting on coat)
I like you. You know how to interest a man. That's half
the battle. You've got quite a future in front of you.
AUDREY
That's what everyone keeps telling me.
JERRY'S VOICE
Ben, I'm gonna count to three -
BEN
Coming, Jer!
(straightens his tie, checks the mirror)
Prudence, I'm leaving now, but I'm going to get myself
back up here to see you right away. And next time we'll
play a different game. I'll make the rules. A fun game.
You'll like it. Everybody wins.
He drops some money the table, blows her a kiss and blows out of the room.
Audrey lowers the mask. She's laughing silently, tears running down her face, close to the
edge.
CUT TO:
5. INT. BLACKIE'S OFFICE - NIGHT
Ben and Jerry enter Blackie's office. BLACKIE sits behind her desk, looking worn and
haggard. She has the shakes.
(CONTINUED)

5. CONTINUED:
BEN
How many blips are we dealing with?
JERRY
Two blips: blip number one, they contained the fire in
the drying sheds -
BEN
It didn't spread to the processing plant?
JERRY
Just the plywood building, not the main plant.
BEN
Manageable. What's blip number two?
JERRY
Leo the Lip's in the hospital -
BEN
As in morgue?
JERRY
That's a big N-O.
Ben chews on that. Turns to Blackie.
BEN
Keep an eye on that new girl. She didn't come across.
JERRY
This sounds like a job for Jerry Horne -
Taking off his coat, Jerry starts for the door. Ben grabs him by the collar.
BEN
Blackie, you're looking a little the worse for wear ...
She shoots him a poisonous look. He takes a packet from his pocket.
BEN (CONTINUED)
Would you like to fix yourself a cocktail? Or would
you rather just say "no?"
BLACKIE
Bastard.
(CONTINUED)
10.
5. CONTINUED:(2)
BEN
What's that, Blackie?
BLACKIE
(humbling herself)
Please.
BEN
And you used to be so pretty.
Ben signals to Jerry, who exits. Ben moves to the door.
BLACKIE
PLEASE.
(he stops, looks at her, she's trembling)
Pretty ... please
Ben tosses the packet onto the desk, shakes his head and exits. Blackie looks at the packet,
opens a drawer [plus other drug paraphenalia], takes out a length of rubber tubing and sets
it on the desk.

8. EXT. MILL - DAWN
PARAMEDICS wheel PETE MARTELL out of the mill, his face covered with an oxygen
mask.
They load Pete, into the back of an ambulance. SHELLY JOHNSON is already inside on
another gurney, also taking oxygen. SHERIFF TRUMAN stands by the ambulance doors.
Pete takes Truman's hand, partially lifts off his mask.
PETE
Catherine?
TRUMAN
Not yet, Pete.
(CONTINUED)

8. CONTINUED:
They look at each other. Pete coughs, they readjust his mask, slide the gurney in, close the
doors. The siren starts up, the ambulance drives off.
Truman moves away and is joined by DEPUTY HAWK
HAWK
Josie's not at Blue Pine, she's not at the office -
TRUMAN
Keep looking.
HAWK
Harry, we've looked everywhere -
TRUMAN
(hard)
Keep looking.
DEPUTY ANDY lopes up to them.
TRUMAN (CONTINUED)
Andy, where the hell is Cooper?
ANDY
It's the strangest thing, I was talking to him and he put
the phone down and walked away and it sounded like
somebody was banging real loud on the door -
TRUMAN
And?
ANDY
And then I heard a sound like somebody falling down
and then about a minute went by and somebody hung up the
phone.
Hawk and Truman look at each other.
CUT TO:
9. INT. COOPER'S ROOM - DAWN
Cooper's hand reaches out for his tape recorder on the floor not far from where he's lying.
His fingertips reach it, gain purchase and drag it back to him. In pain and slightly fumble-
fingered he's able to activate the record button, lie back and bring the recorder to his mouth.
COOPER
Diane, it's - I don't know what time it is, Diane, I've
been shot. I was out for a while and I can't reach my

COOPER (CONTINUED)
watch. The sky's getting light, I can hear birdsong. I'm
lying on the floor of my room. There is a great deal of
pain and a fair amount of blood. I seem to remember
three shots, all to the midsection. I was wearing my vest
last night, per Bureau regulations when undercover, but
even so, if you can imagine someone dropping three
bowling balls on your chest from a height of about nine
feet you might begin to approximate the sensation.
(looking at his chest)
On balance, though, being shot is not as bad as I had
always imagined it might be. If you can manage to
keep the fear from your mind. Then again, I suppose
you could say that about almost anything in life: it's not
so bad if you can keep the fear from your mind.
(he wrestles with it)
At a time like this, curiously, you immediately think of
the things you regret, or the things you would miss. I
would like, in general, to treat people with much more
care and respect. I would like to climb a tall hill, sit in
the cool grass and feel the sun on my face. I wish I could
have cracked the Lindbergh kidnapping. I would very
much like to make love to a beautiful woman who I had
genuine affection for. I would like that very much.
(he has to stop)
All in all, a very interesting experience.
SOUND of running footsteps. Truman, Hawk and Andy appear in the doorway.
COOPER (CONTINUED)
Ah. They're here.

11. INT. CALHOUN HOSPITAL INTENSIVE CARE - DAY
CAMERA MOVES slowly past a row of charts hanging on hooks at a nurse's station: we read
the names on the charts:
... Pulaski, Ronnette; Jacoby, Lawrence; Hurley, Nadine; Johnson, Shelly; Martell, Pete;
Johnson, Leo ...
A NURSE takes a seventh unmarked chart; off the last hook and CAMERA MOVES with her
picking up staying with an extremely tired DOC HAYWARD sitting in a chair. She hands
the chart to Hayward. He rises and together they move into an adjoining room ...
CUT TO:
12. INT. INTENSIVE CARE DAY
Hayward and the Nurse enter. Cooper is seated on an examining table. Another NURSE is
cutting away his shirt; revealing his bulletproof vest. Truman stands nearby.
COOPER
(pale, shaky but game)
Morning, Doc.
HAYWARD
My God, what happened to you?
COOPER
Three slugs, point blank range.
TRUMAN
You can't remember anything about the shooter.
COOPER
All I saw was that muzzle flash and the next thing I knew
I was drifting on Cloud Nine - busy night, Doc?
HAYWARD
Haven't seen this much action since the Elks Club fire in
'59 - here we go ...
Doc and the Nurse ease the bloodstained vest off Cooper. He groans. Large ugly bruises are

the bruises.
LUCY
(a little faint)
Oh boy ...
A little woozy, Truman helps her to a chair.
TRUMAN
Easy there, Luce.
LUCY
Oh boy ...
One of the Nurses partially closes the curtain between the bed and where Lucy is sitting. Lucy
pours herself a cup of coffee.
COOPER
Looks worse than it feels Lucy.
HAYWARD
Let's have you lie back.
Hayward and a Nurse help Cooper lie back. We see there's a bullet partially embedded in his
midsection near a rib.
COOPER
Doc, I think I picked up a wood tick last night. While
trying to scratch it off I adjusted my vest upwards and I
think one shot glanced off the edge of my vest.
HAYWARD
(examining the bullet)
Agent Cooper, I'd have to say you're lucky to be alive.
COOPER
I try to tell myself that at least once a day.
LUCY
Coffee?
COOPER
You bet.
TRUMAN
(taking a cup, quietly)
Lucy, Agent Cooper needs to be brought up to date.
(CONTINUED)

LUCY
Okay.
TRUMAN
Cooper, I'm working on a warrant for Leo. Arrest and search
Truman exits. Hayward is prepping to remove the bullet from Cooper's side.
COOPER
Go ahead, Lucy.
LUCY
Okay.
HAYWARD
I ought to administer an anesthetic.
COOPER
No, just hand me my wallet and say when.
Puzzled, Doc nods to a Nurse, who hands Cooper his wallet.
LUCY
This morning, at around 5:45 a.m. Jacques Renault was
found dead in his bed. It appears to be cardiac arrest,
which is what happened to my Uncle Walter after he had
the accident with the lawnmower, but the cause of death
is not yet officially known.
COOPER
Autopsy?
HAYWARD
Soon as we get a minute.
COOPER
Please continue, Lucy.
Cooper watches as Hayward lays out a row of severe looking surgical instruments,
including a wicked pliar-like utensil.
LUCY
Doctor Jacoby is resting comfortably after his heart
attack, and Ronnette Pulaski is still on life support,
which the Sheriff told me you already knew about but
that I should remind you.
(CONTINUED)

12. CONTINUED:(3)
COOPER
Thank you.
HAYWARD
You might be able to question Jacoby later today.
LUCY
Shelly Johnson and Pete Martell are in stable condition
after they were found inside the mill, which caught fire
and burned down, at least a part of it did not the whole
mill which is lucky because they had all that lumber
inside -
HAYWARD
A few second-degree burns, smoke inhalation -
LUCY
Smoke inhalation, in addition to which I think Shelly is
a smoker anyway.
Doc and Cooper look at each other.
LUCY (CONTINUED)
Nadine Hurley is still unconscious and in serious
condition because of an overdose of sleeping pills.
COOPER
Accidental?
HAYWARD
(swabbing Cooper's wound)
Ed says she left a note.
COOPER
Damn.
HAYWARD
Ready, Cooper?
COOPER
(nods)
Keep talking, Lucy.
Cooper puts the wallet in his mouth and bites down hard. Hayward picks up the pliars and
goes to work.
LUCY
Leo Johnson was found in his house by Deputy Brennan

with a single gunshot wound to his upper chest. There
appears to be a spinal injury associated with this wound,
he's just out of surgery an at this time is still
unconscious and in critical condition -
Hayward, who's been working vigorously, pulls hard, the bullet comes out and Cooper lets
out a yell. Hayward examines the bullet. We see the leg's of a dead tick attached to the end.
HAYWARD
Hell of a way to kill a tick.
CUT TO:
13. INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
Truman looks in on ED HURLEY, sitting by the bedside of the unconscious NADINE,
holding her hand, watching her with fear and devotion, trying to will her back. Truman
respectfully withdraws before Ed realizes he's there.
CUT TO:
14. INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
Truman enters another room, where a NURSE is tending to Shelly, lying quietly in bed, pale,
exhausted, coughing gently every now and then. Truman nods to the Nurse, who exits.
Truman sits by the edge of the bed. Shelly manages a weak smile.
TRUMAN
Hi Shelly.
SHELLY
Hi. Hope you don't mind if I don't get you coffee.
(starts to cough. He pats her arm)
Leo know I'm here?
TRUMAN
Shelly ...
SHELLY
(sees the look on his face)
What? What?
TRUMAN
Leo was shot last night. He's here in the hospital.
SHELLY
Oh my God ...
TRUMAN
It's bad. You should know there's a chance he may not
make it.

SHELLY
Oh my God, what happened?
TRUMAN
We don't know. We found him at your house about an
hour ago.
SHELLY
At our house?
Truman nods. Shelly's thinking, eyes darting around, exploring the possibilities.
TRUMAN
Shelly ... we're gonna need to ask you some questions.
(she nods)
Can you tell me what you were doing at the mill?
Tears come to Shelly's eyes.
SHELLY
Would it be okay if maybe ... we could talk a little
later? It's just ... you know, with Leo ...
She starts to cry. Truman pats her on the shoulder.
TRUMAN
I understand. You rest up for a while. I'll be back to see
you.
SHELLY
Thanks, Sheriff.
Truman rises, exits. Shelly tries to put the pieces together.
SHELLY (CONTINUED)

Bobby ... Bobby, help me ...

15. INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY
Truman exits Shelly's room, sees Ed coming out of Nadine's room. They approach. Ed
shrugs, a heartbreaking look of helplessness. Truman gives him a hug.
TRUMAN
I'm sorry.

ED
She's always been a fighter. I'm betting on her.
TRUMAN
I'd lay money on that myself.
ED
I should have been with her. This wouldn't've happened.
TRUMAN
You can't blame yourself.
ED
But I do, you see. That's the whole problem.
(pulling himself back)
Have you seen James? He ought'a know, I've been trying
to get hold of him.
Truman decides not to complicate Ed's emotional state.
TRUMAN
Let me take care of that for you.
ED
Thanks, Harry.
(emotion swelling again)
She knows I'm there. She squeezes my hand when I talk
to her. She can hear me.
TRUMAN
'Course she can, Ed. You stay with her. You'll bring her
back.
Ed pats him on the back, nods, goes back in, as Truman moves off.
Cooper, walking stiffly, putting on his shirt, is exiting his room further down the corridor,
pursued by a distraught Hayward and a confused Lucy.
HAYWARD
- I want to be very clear this is completely against my
recommendation -
COOPER
Thanks, Doc, duly noted -
HAYWARD
You've lost some blood, you've got two cracked ribs,
some torn cartiledge and possibly a bruised lung -

COOPER

Lucy, maybe you could run down to the pharmacy and
pick me up a large bottle of aspirin - Doc, when the
will is firmly invoked the recuperative powers of the
physical body are simply extraordinary -
HAYWARD
Harry, I want to go on record, this man should be in a
hospital.
TRUMAN
I hear you, Doc -
(to Cooper, search warrant in hand)
We're ready to give Leo's house a top to bottom.
COOPER
Good, let's get to work.
TRUMAN
I guess we can't formally arrest him until he's conscious.
COOPER
Correct. Put a guard on his door, zip up the exits,
nothing leaks to the press until we've finished the search.
Cooper stops. Ahead of them, being wheeled out of a room and down the hall by two
[ORDERLIES] is a gurney holding a huge figure in a large rubber body bag.
COOPER
What's that?
TRUMAN
That's Jacques.
COOPER
(remembering)
"Shock in a big rubber bag."
TRUMAN
Excuse me?
COOPER
Tell you later. Come on, Harry, we've got work to do:
the attempted murder of a federal agent is an extremely
serious crime and it barely cracks our top five.
Cooper moves off, a pained, awakward gait. Hayward and Truman look at each other.

Truman shrugs and starts after Cooper.
COOPER (CONTINUED)
Harry, if you don't mind, you're going to have to do

As they round the corner, we move to look down a long, empty corridor. We move down it
slowly.

MADDY
I had the strangest dream last night.
SARAH
About Laura?
MADDY
I'm not sure. Maybe. I was in a desert. It was hot and
dry. There was some kind of animal with me, I
couldn't see it but I could feel it breathing on me.
SARAH
What kind of animal?
MADDY
A big cat. I think it was gray. I could see its eyes,
yellow and red. Then we were in the woods. It was very
dark. I woke up and the window was open. There was a
cold wind blowing through the room.
From the other room, loud robust singing approaches.

LELAND PALMER enters the room, well dressed in a three-piece buisness suit, carrying his
briefcase. He continues to sing, happy and good-natured, genuinely trying to entertain the
two women. His hair has turned completely white.

A little bit jumpled and jivey ...

BEN
Travel safely, Einer; (Icelandic phrase): next year in
Rekyavik!
Ben pulls Jerry into the office, closes the door and barks instructions.
BEN (CONTINUED)
On the bus, on the runway, right up to the plane; no
television, no newspapers and make sure the pilot
doesn't fly over the mill, until their check clears as far as
they're concerned that fire never happened.
JERRY
What fire?
Ben gives him a friendly slap on the cheek.
BEN
(lowers his voice)
Agenda: let's get a location on Catherine, keep our
distance, We just want to be sure she's ready to take the
fall, I want a complete medical on Leo Johnson's

Hank Jennings why that punk [LEO] isn't being measured for a
plot at Ghostwood Memorial Park.
JERRY
Well begun is half done.
The SOUND of the Icelanders is interrupted by the approaching sound of Leland singing
"Mare-se-doats." The doors open as he finishes the chorus. Leland spreads his
arms, a happy smile on his face, his white hair standing up like a field of albino wheat.
LELAND

CUT TO:
21. INT. LEO JOHNSON'S HOUSE - DAY
Full-scale forensics going on in the living room; technicians measuring the trajectory the
bullet took through the broken window. Truman examines the bite Leo's axe took out of the
wall. Hawk comes out of the bedroom with a small box containing some skin mags,
including a few back issues of Flesh World, takes them to Cooper, seated stiffly on a chair in
the middle of the room. We see two PLAINCLOTHES COPS are carefully dismantling the
kitchen in a thorough search.
HAWK
Surprise; Flesh World.
COOPER
Good customers must get complimentary subscriptions.
HAWK
Still no cocaine, here or in the truck.
COOPER
We may have to bring in the dogs. Let's get those down
to the station.
TRUMAN
I can't figure it; some kind of fight was going on in here.
COOPER
Well they weren't doing the Tennessee waltz.
TRUMAN
But the shot came from outside.
COOPER
He wasn't shot by the person he was fighting with.
TRUMAN
(an idea taking shape)
Two people.
(CONTINUED)

21. CONTINUED:
COOPER
Leo was trying to turn somebody to kindling. The
person went down and hit that television; the legs were
moved off the depressions in the carpet. Leo advanced,
axe raised, the shot knocked him back onto the couch.
TRUMAN
Shelly?
COOPER
Shelly's about ninety-nine pounds soaking wet; that's a
big old television.
TRUMAN
Was she the shooter?
COOPER
That depends on when she got to the mill.
Truman nods.
CUT TO:
22. EXT. LEO JOHNSON'S - DAY
Deputy Andy is working the perimeter outside. He looks up to see a government issue car
roar up nearby and stop in a cloud of dust. AGENT ALBERT ROSENFIELD and his two
ASISSTANTS climb out of the car. Andy immediately turns and runs to the house.
CUT TO:
23. INT. LEO JOHNSON'S PORCH - DAY
Andy enters and starts for the door.
ANDY
Harry! Harry! It's Agent Rosenflower!
Andy steps on a loose plank levers up like a shot and WHACKS him in the face. He goes
down. Truman comes out onto the porch from the kitchen, just as Albert enters through the
outside door. They stare at each other. Andy moans quietly. Albert looks at him.
ALBERT
Another great moment in law enforcement history.
The plank Andy dislodged reveals a cavity under the porch, which Truman is the first to
notice. He kneels down to take a look ...

A small bottle of ammonia or some like chemical is opened. HANK JENNINGS lets the
fumes from the bottle drift up into his face. He inhales, his eyes redden and start to rear. He
replaces the bottle top and hides the bottle as NORMA JENNINGS enters the kitchen.
She's not in uniform this morning.
Hank lets her catch a glimpse of him before turning away.
NORMA
Hank?
Hank grabs a broom and starts to sweep up, trying to hide his "tears."
HANK
Yeah. Hi.
NORMA
What is it?
HANK
Nuthin'. Fine.
She regards him, trust still an issue but today perhaps slightly more on the fence.

NORMA

Uh-huh.
HANK
(pause, stops sweeping)
I can't stop thinking of little Shelly in that burning mill
... and then as if that's not bad enough, she comes out of
it to find Leo's been shot? I don't know. I mean I've
done some rotten things in my life, I don't pretend to be
any saint, I've paid for it, but why do bad things happen
to good people? It just ... doesn't seem fair.
(tries to lighten up)
Anyway ...
NORMA
(somewhat noncommital)
I'm just on my way over to see her.
HANK
Yeah, listen, I was gonna send her some flowers
(takes out some cash)
Maybe you could ...
She takes the money.
NORMA
That's a nice thought.
HANK
Sometimes I guess it is the thought that counts.
NORMA
She'll get through this. She's tougher than she looks.
HANK
Yeah. Kind'a reminds me of somebody.
A wistful grin for her benefit. She half-smiles, pockets the money, starts out.
NORMA
She likes snapdragons.

MADDY
Is it true about James?
DONNA
He spent the night in jail.
MADDY
Do you think it's because of what we did?
DONNA
Look, we don't know if we "did" anything. My dad
says Dr. Jacoby got sick because he was attacked; all we
did was send him a tape.
MADDY
Maybe he wouldn't have been attacked if we hadn't.
DONNA
Maybe. Maybe the sun won't come up tomorrow if we
wash our hair. Think like that you could go crazy.
What's done is done. The only way this won't came
back to haunt us is if we keep quiet about what happened
last night, because I can promise you that's what James is
doing. Get the picture?
MADDY
(feeling a little distant)
Loud and clear.
DONNA
I don't know why they're holding James, I'll try to find
out. In the meantime, mum is the word.
MADDY
I heard they caught Laura's killer.
DONNA
If that's true why haven't they made an announcement?
MADDY
That's what Uncle Leland said this morning -
DONNA
Did they come to your house? Did you see it on the
news?

White as a sheet.
DONNA
That's weird.
Norma sees them.
NORMA
Oh, Donna,. I've got something for you here.
She takes an envelope out from under the counter and moves to the booth.

AUDREY
Say, when do they put on the feedbag around here? I
could eat a bear.
PICK-UP
Kitchen's open twenty-four hours a day.
AUDREY
Yeah? My door isn't. There's no doorknob on my side.
PICK-UP
That's for security.
AUDREY
Whose security?
PICK-UP
All the new girls get this room at first.
AUDREY

All of them?

The Girl likes her and is friendly, but is also clearly operating under some other instructions.

PICK-UP

AUDREY
They don't like you asking questions?
The Girl gestures to be quiet, nods, points to a small screen in the wall; a speaker. Audrey
nods, understanding.
AUDREY (CONTINUED)
(for the speaker's benefit)
I wouldn't normally be so curious, but Jack's is such a
first-rate joint I'd like to know more about how it's run.
PICK-UP

The owner was a little disappointed in your performance

Oh? That's not what he told me.
BLACKIE
He said you were witholding.
AUDREY
Okay, right away, here's my analysis of the guy, he's a
big cheese, girls are falling like ripe tomatoes every
time he walks into a room. Hey, a steady diet of caviar
would eventually kill you, right? I ask myself, what's
this guy missing? Conquest, the thrill of victory.
BLACKIE
So you turned tail and made him chase you.
AUDREY
So to speak. You know the guy, am I right?
BLACKIE
(cooly assesses her, then)
Did you find him attractive?
AUDREY
Attractive? Yes. I wouldn't say he was my type exactly.
Blackie rises and insinuates her way right up to Audrey. She touches Audrey's check.
BLACKIE
And who would you say is your type, exactly?
AUDREY
Not you. No offense.
Blackie slaps her hard. Audrey raises her hand to slap back. Blackie catches her wrist.

Cooper, shirt off, ribs heavily taped, sits on the conference table, as Albert Rosenfield
examines him, using a stethescope. Albert's briefcase is open on the table.
ALBERT
How simple can I make it, Cooper? FBI Agent gets
shot; FBI Agent investigates. I'm in proximity,
working in the Seattle lab, I'm familiar with the
underlying case -
COOPER
We don't know that they're related.
ALBERT
Right. You didn't pick up your towels so the chamber
maid plugged you.
COOPER
Albert, the point is you're not going to win any local
popularity contests -
ALBERT
No, the point is Gordon Cole ordered me back here.
We follow orders. Breathe.
(he listens to a breath)
You were shot by a right-handed person, five foot six to
ten inches tall, at a distance of less than three feet. I'll
have ballistics this afternoon. You're blank on other
details?
COOPER
Yes.
ALBERT
I'll take it from here. Meanwhile one of your principal
suspects was murdered in his hospital bed, the other was
shot in his living room. You tell me: vigilante justice or
just clean country living?
(CONTINUED)

COOPER
Albert, let me ask you something; where does this
attitude of generalized unpleasantness come from?
ALBERT
(pause, looks at him)
I'll get back to you.
COOPER
If you don't want both eyes blackened on a regular basis,
while you're here I suggest you make some kind of peace
with rural life.
ALBERT
Great. After the square dance maybe we can go for a
hayride. I'll be at the hospital.
A knock. Andy Brennan enters.
ANDY
Agent Cooper? You wanted to see me?
COOPER
Have a seat, Andy.
Andy sits. Albert packs up his briefcase.
COOPER (CONTINUED)
Andy, I wanted to have a brief chat about the events of
yesterday.
ANDY
Okay.
COOPER
When an officer's involved in something like this, it can
result in a great number of distractions in the workplace.
ANDY
Uh-huh.
COOPER
The thing to focus on is your daily routine; cling to it.
Let it become the tent pole around which you organize
your waking life.

ANDY

Okay.
COOPER
The job can provide the structure you need to survive,
while body and mind are left free to heal the wounds our
work occasionally, inevitably inflicts.
ANDY
(starting to look confused)
All right.
COOPER
Even if committed in the line of duty and in a timely
and heroic fashion, the firing of our weapon, the shooting
of another human being, no matter how villainous the
individual may be, exacts a spiritual and emotional toll
on the officer.
ANDY
(sees the light)
Oh.
(clearing up the misunderstanding)
I thought you were talking about me and Lucy.
Cooper looks at him. At the door, Albert looks at Andy, back at Cooper.

you later, Lawrence, bye-bye.
Tape hiss, then silence. Truman turns off the tape.
TRUMAN
You got this tape from Dr. Jacoby's office.
JAMES
Yes sir.
TRUMAN
That's breaking and entering, James.
JAMES

I knocked, nobody answered.
TRUMAN
You were alone?

JAMES
Yes.
Pause.
TRUMAN
James, maybe you had your reasons. You realize we may
not see it that way. Especially with three ounces of
cocaine in your gas tank.
JAMES
You know I didn't put that there.
TRUMAN
I know what I'd like to believe. I also know you were
seeing Laura the last few weeks, which means you could
have been mixed up in anything.
JAMES
Uncle Ed know I'm in here?
TRUMAN
I haven't told him yet.
(pause)
Nadine took an overdose of pills last night. She's in the
hospital. Ed's with her. I didn't want to tell him about
this.

I never put it together until I heard the tape, where she
said "this guy can really light my fire?" She said
something once about a friend of her father's.
Somebody she'd known since she was a kid. She said
this guy was really into fire.
TRUMAN
What did she mean by that?
JAMES
I don't know. Laura said a lot of nutty stuff. Most of
the time it went right by you.
Cooper enters the room, still walking strangely, followed by Hawk.
COOPER
James, let's get right to the point. You found something
else in Jacoby's office. I want it. Give it to me.
James looks at Truman, looks back at Cooper. Cooper holds out his hand.
COOPER (CONTINUED)
Come on.
James takes out the half-a-heart necklace, puts it in Cooper's hand.
JAMES
That was with the tape.
COOPER
Very good. Hawk, take James back to his cell.

They're now in the conference room. The box that came for Cooper in the mail is open on

southern part of the state. We already know Ronette and
Laura's picture appeared in ads in the magazine -
ANDY
You want us to look for a picture of Theresa Banks.
COOPER
Andy, you're way ahead of me.
Andy smiles pridefully at Lucy, then remembers how upset he is and cancels the look.
COOPER (CONTINUED)
Lucy, we'll be at the hospital.

DONNA
Do they think Leo killed Laura?
JAMES
I don't know what they think. How's Maddy?
DONNA
She's all right. She hasn't said anything either. I heard
them say Jacoby's conscious, they're going to question
him.
JAMES
Great.
Donna stubs the cigarette out on a bar, peeks at him over the dark glasses.
DONNA
So ... don't you want to kiss me?
They look at each other. James leans forward and kisses her tenderly through the bars; she
responds agressively, grabs him, hot. He pulls back and looks at her, puzzled.
DONNA (CONTINUED)
(slightly teasing)
What's wrong?
JAMES
Nothing's wrong.

He breathes once on the stethescope, erotically places it on her chest.

all through school [four years]. Everybody figured we'd get
hitched, that'd be that, I barely knew Nadine to say hello
to. That spring, one bad weekend, Norma ran off with Hank.
I was so twisted up inside I couldn't see straight. When I
opened my eyes there was Nadine right in front of me.
There was something so ... sweet and helpless about her.
We drove all night. Ended up in some little town in
Montana, out past Great Falls ... I asked her to marry
me, half-joking, half-drunk, half-crazy. It was getting
light when we found a Justice of the Peace.
(pause)
Norma, she ... she hadn't even slept with Hank. The
look on her face when she found out ...
(pause)
Nadine and I, we went up to my Dad's old cabin, up in
Eagle Pass. Honeymoon. I was hoping maybe we'd get
around to talking about an anullment, a divorce,
anything. But Nadine was so happy.
(pause)
The first day we went hunting pheasant. Wanted to bag our
own dinner. Nadine was a crack shot. We had two birds
already, but I felt good shooting, liked the way the sound
echoed and rolled down those hills. I fired. A piece of
buckshot skipped off a rock and caught her square in the eye.
(pause)
She laid across my lap as I drove us back to town. She
never cried, never blamed me, never hated me for it.
'Couple months later, Norma married Hank.
(pause)
I don't believe in fate. You make your bed. You sleep in it.
Cooper's moved. Ed strokes Nadine's cheek, moves a strand of hair. A soft knock on the
door. [Albert takes out a handkerchief, pretends to dab at his eyes.]
TRUMAN [HAWK'S VOICE]

What happened to you?
HAYWARD
I'll see about some coffee.
TRUMAN
Thanks, Doc.
Cooper and Truman take seats beside Jacboy's bed.

Cooper reveals the half-a-heart necklace. Jacoby is saddened seeing it, holds it gently in his
hands.
JACOBY
Shall I start at the beginning?
COOPER
That's as good a place as any.
JACOBY
Laura started coming to see me nine months ago. On her
own. Picked my name out of the phone book. I thought,
what in the world could be troubling such a bright,
pretty girl?
COOPER
And?
JACOBY
Laura was, in essence, living a double life; two people,
self-divided, and those two selves were literally at war.
A war of attrition. And the part of her that was good
and loving was gradually losing ground.
COOPER
Why?
JACOBY
Because the other self was stronger. The last time I saw
her, two days before her death, it seemed to me she had
reached a kind of peace with herself. I now believe that
what she had in fact arrived at was a decision to end her
life.
TRUMAN
Suicide?
COOPER
She didn't kill herself.
JACOBY
No. She allowed herself to be killed.
(CONTINUED)
52.
44. CONTINUED:(2)
TRUMAN
I don't understand.
JACOBY
She had reached a point where her good self believed
that death was the only way to prevent the other side
from complete domination. Death, in this sense,
represented a kind of victory.
TRUMAN
Good Lord ...
COOPER
(alert, moving him along)
The necklace ...
JACOBY
As I told you,the night after she died, I followed a man
in a red corvette.
COOPER
Leo Johnson.
JACOBY
Correct. He eluded me near the Old Sawmill Road.
As I sat there cursing my lack of horsepower, a
motorcycle drove by -
COOPER
James and Donna.
JACOBY
Which I discovered after following them, on foot, into
the woods. They spoke intently for a while, I couldn't
hear them, then they buried something in the ground and
drove away.

Pause. Cooper gently takes it from him.
COOPER

One more thing. You were in this room with Jacques
when he was killed.
JACOBY
Yes. Heavily sedated.
TRUMAN
Did you see or hear anything?
JACOBY
I can remember hearing the fire alarm go off.
(tries to think)
That's all, I ... it's all like a dream, I'm sorry. Wait, I

When he died, Jacques voided his bowels.

SHELLY
You know, I got a real sweet tooth, too.
NORMA
I've got some fresh choclate/peanut butter pie.
SHELLY
Norma, I'm serious: bring the whole pie.
NORMA
Feel better, sweetie.
SHELLY
I do already.

Bye-bye.
Norma moves down the corridor. She stops outside Nadine's room, sees Ed at her bedside,

in his shirt front.
BOBBY
(surprised)
Dad?
An awkward moment.
MAJOR BRIGGS
Would you ... care to join me?
Bobby looks around. No escape.
BOBBY
Yeah, okay.
Bobby slumps into the booth across from his father.
MAJOR BRIGGS
How was school today?
BOBBY
School? Oh. Fine.
MAJOR BRIGGS
That's good.
The Major takes another bite of pie. A brief lull.

Bobby, would you care for a piece of pie? The huckleberries are
particularly delicious today.
BOBBY
No, thanks.
MAJOR BRIGGS
Particularly fresh and delicious.
More pie and a pause.
BOBBY
This is so weird.
MAJOR BRIGGS
Oh, I've been coming here for Norma's pie and coffee
for many years. It's a short drive from the base, roughly
twelve minutes if the lights are with you. At one time, I
was nearly what you might call a habitue.
BOBBY
You don't say.
Finishing his pie, Major Briggs tidily wipes the corners of his mouth, pushes his plate away
and folds his napkin.
MAJOR BRIGGS
The gospel truth. Son, may I share something with you?
BOBBY
Not the pie.
(CONTINUED)

MAJOR BRIGGS
A vision I had in my sleep last night. As distinguished
from a dream, which is a mere sorting and cataloguing
of the day's events by the subconscious; a vision, fresh
and clear as a mountain stream, the mind revealing itself
to itself.
BOBBY
Uh-huh.
MAJOR BRIGGS
In my vision I was on the verandah of a vast estate, a
palazzo of some fantastic proportion. There seemed to
emanate from it, a light from within this gleaming,
radiant marble. I ha known this place. I had, in fact,
been born and raised there and this was my first return, a
reunion with the deepest wellsprings of my being. As I
wandered about I noticed happily that the house had
been immaculately maintained and there had been
added to it a number of additional rooms but in a way
that blended in so seamlessly with the original
construction one would never detect any difference.
Returning to the house's grand foyer, there came a knock
at the door. I opened it. My son was standing there. It
wasn't you, but in a way it was. He was happy and
carefree, clearly living a life of deep harmony and joy.
We embraced, a warm and loving embrace, nothing
witheld. We were, in this moment, one. My vision
ended and I awoke with an overwhelming feeling of
optimism and confidence about you and your future.
That was my vision of you.
BOBBY
(touched in spite of himself)
Really.
MAJOR BRIGGS
I'm so glad I've had this opporunity to share it with
you.
Major Briggs rises and extends a hand. He and Bobby shakes hands.
MAJOR BRIGGS (CONTINUED)
I wish you nothing but the very best in all things.
BOBBY
Thank you.

I'll see you later at home.
BOBBY
Okay.
Major Briggs moves off to pay his bill. Hank mans the register.
HANK
How was everything?
MAJOR BRIGGS
Exceptional, as always.
HANK
Great.
Major Briggs tips his hat, gives Bobby a happy wave and exits. Bobby waves back, sits in the
booth, trying to add this up to a round figure.
Norma enters the diner, clearly upset. She moves behind the counter, starts towards the
back.
HANK
How was she? ... Norma?
NORMA
(close to tears)
I can't talk right now.
She disappears into the kitchen. Hank gives a look to Bobby, a conspiritorial shrug
("women") before moving off. Bobby returns it, before remembering where he last saw
Hank.

ALBERT

Oh. Was I late?
COOPER

Cooper flips over the squeaky blackboard. A map of the town featuring a number of
symbols, houses, etc. have been drawn on the board.
COOPER (CONTINUED)
Lucy, if you could man the pointer, I need to sit down.
He takes out his collapsible pointer, telescopes it to full length, hands it to Lucy and sits.
Lucy stands in front of the board, blows her nose.
COOPER (CONTINUED)
We'll keep this simple, Lucy. When I say something,
you point to it.
LUCY

Leo drove Laura to a location somewhere near the Pearl
Lakes off Highway J, at the foot of the trail leading to
Jacques Renault's cabin.
Lucy points again.
COOPER (CONTINUED)
... they met Jacques and Ronnette Pulaski here and
climbed the trail to Jacques' cabin, where they were
heard passing by the cabin of Margaret the Log Lady.
They reached the cabin at approximately one a.m. They
partied; drugs and liquor were consumed. Laura was
tied up and had sexual relations with both Leo and
Jacques. Waldo, Jacques's bird, was let out of his cage
and attacked Laura. Leo and Jacques fought. Jacques
went outside and passed out. When he came to, Leo and
the girls were gone.
Cooper rises stiffly.
COOPER (CONTINUED)
The Log Lady heard a Third Man pass by her cabin,
go up the hill. This Third Man witnessed the events
in the cabin, watching through a window.

Laura was still tied up when the Third Man entered the
cabin.
TRUMAN
It wasn't Jacques or Leo?
COOPER
Laura had ten thousand dollars in her safe deposit box. I
believe that was drug money she owed to Leo. Leo
wouldn't have killed her without first collecting that
money. Leo also has an ironclad alibi for the night
Theresa Banks was murdered. He was in jail, in Twin
Peaks, on an assault charge.
ALBERT
The Third Man took Laura and Ronette to the train car,
here, on foot, a mile and half away.
Lucy points.

He wore surgical gloves, he was thorough, he was careful.

Heat like that they'll be lucky to find teeth.
BEN
Marvelous. If they don't hang the arson on the late,
lamented Catherine and her "co-conspirator" Leo I'll
give up sex.
JERRY
(finishing his apple)
That's ... confidence.
Hank lifts Catherine's illicit mill ledger off the desk.
HANK
What do we do with the ledger?
BEN
(taking it from him)
Hank ... leave the creative thinking to the brothers Horne.
You're a bicep; relax until we say flex ...
Jerry feels Hank's muscle; impressive.
HANK

71. INT. PALMER HOUSE - NIGHT
Sarah and Leland are dressed for an evening out. Leland is deftly spinning Sarah around the
room with a few light dance steps, humming some public domain tune. Sarah is smiling and
enjoying it in spite of herself.
Maddy and Donna watch from the doorway to the room. Leland finishes the dance.
LELAND
Come on, doll, let's paint the town.
(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
SARAH
(not complaining)
Leland, I don't know what's gotten in to you.
LELAND
That old black magic's got me in its spell.
SARAH
Something has, that much is for sure.
LELAND
Girls, you should have seen Sarah dance. We used to win
all the dance contests down at the Grange Hall; the other
couples would see us coming and just walk off the floor.
SARAH
Leland ...
LELAND
It's true - isn't it true?
SARAH
(to Maddy)
We won't be late.
MADDY
Say hi to the Haywards for me.
DONNA
I'll probably see you over there.
Leland gives Maddy a kiss, dances Sarah through the archway towards the front door,
humming another tune.
DONNA
(breaking out the smokes)
I half expected him to start dancing up the walls like
Fred Astaire.
MADDY
It's nice to see them enjoying themselves.
Donna pulls out a list; they sit on the sofa.
DONNA
So listen, I got hold of the list of Meals on Wheels
clients that Laura used to visit. It used to be nine, now
it's eight since old Mr. Pendergast died.

MADDY
What are you gonna do?
DONNA
I told Norma I'd take over the deliveries tomorrow,
I'll spend some time with everybody on her route ...
She unfolds a small town map.
DONNA (CONTINUED)
I put x's on all the addresses. One of these eight
people must have sent me that note; that means they
know something. We just have to figure out who it was.
As Donna concentrates over her map, Maddy feels an odd, disquieting feeling come over her.
She tries to shake it off, can't. SOUND of Donna's voice grows fainter.
DONNA (CONTINUED)
Laura never talked much about them. Guess we know by
now that doesn't necessarily mean there wasn't anything
weird about them ...
Maddy turns slowly and looks into the alcove of the living room. Standing there, stock still,
is BOB, the grey-haired man we've seen in Cooper's dream and Mrs. Palmer's vision.
Maddy's frozen with fear. Donna doesn't immediately notice. Maddy starts to tremble,
unable to speak. Bob doesn't move. He just looks at her.
Donna finally notices her distress.
DONNA (CONTINUED)
Maddy? ... Maddy?
MADDY
(turning to her)
Huh?
DONNA
What is it? What's wrong?
Maddy just looks at her, looks back. Bob is gone.

Dinner is just breaking up in the dining room. Sarah Palmer is helping EILEEN HAYWARD
clear the table.
EILEEN
Here, you can just put some of the dishes in my lap.
SARAH
Oh, no, I don't mind, it's no trouble.
LELAND
Now Eileen, I've been looking forward to one of your
deserts all day; I hope you won't disappoint me.
EILEEN
Leland, you know me better than that.
SARAH
I'll give you a hand.
Eileen wheels towards the kitchen; Sarah follows.
SARAH (CONTINUED)
Let's put on a pot of decaf.
EILEEN
I've got both if you want regular.
They're gone. Leland looks over at Doc. Doc's got an elbow on the table, propping up his
chin. He's sound asleep. His chin slips, he wakes with a start.
LELAND
Long day, Will?
DOC
I feel like I've sat through back to back operas.
LELAND
Terrible about the mill.
(CONTINUED)

DOC
They say over a hundred and fifty jobs may be lost.
LELAND
Awful.
DOC
(gently probing)
I suppose that opens the door for Ben Horne and his big
development plans.
LELAND
(good natured)
As his lawyer, and yours, of course I can't comment.
DOC
As your doctor, Leland, what the hell happened to your
hair?
LELAND
Isn't it strange? I woke up this morning, looked in the
mirror and there it was, literally changed overnight.
DOC
Considering all you've been through ...
LELAND
It's a funny thing, though. Seeing it I seemed to realize
I'd turned a corner somehow. I felt a great deal of
sadness still, yes, but it wasn't as overwhelming; I
actual physcially felt as if a large weight had been
lifted from my heart.
DOC
Perhaps it has.
LELAND
Perhaps it has. God, I feel like singing.
DOC
That would be very nice. We always enjoy hearing you
sing, Leland.
LELAND
You know me, Will; it was either law school or
Broadway.
Eileen and Sarah return from the kitchen, bearing coffee and desert.

DOC
Eileen, Leland would like to favor us with a song.
EILEEN
Oh, I'd really enjoy that.
LELAND
(asking for accompaniment)
Sarah?
SARAH
Of course, dear.
EILEEN
Let's move into the living room, shall we?
They do. Doc sits facing the piano. Eileen beside him. Sarah sits down at the piano. Leland
whispers something to her, she nods.
LELAND
Excuse me just one second.
Leland disappears into the foyer for a moment. Sarah gets a signal from him and starts to
play the intro to "Get Happy."
Leland enters with a hat and cane. He sings "Get Happy," hoofs a little, not inexpertly. Doc
and Eileen seem to enoy it a great deal. As he enters the second verse Leland's tempo picks
up and accelerates, heading towards manic. Sarah has trouble keeping up.
Doc and Eileen try to smile through it. At the end of the second verse, at fever pitch, Leland
keels over and passes out on the floor. Doc and Sarah rush to him.
SARAH
Oh dear ...
Doc loosens Leland's collar, slaps his checks.
DOC
Sarah, if you could just get me my bag.
Eileen is alreay wheeling her way to them with it.
EILEEN
Got it right here.
DOC
I'm sure it's nothing serious ...

Doc rummages through his bag for some smelling salts.
SARAH
(at a bit of a loss)
He's been singing all day. Mostly old songs.
Doc waves some of the salts in front of Leland's nose. He immediately revives, looks up at
them all and smiles.
LELAND
I feel fine. I feel fine.
They look at him.

A frightened and bewildered, and slightly brusied, Audrey lies on her bed.
AUDREY
(a kind of prayer)
Agent Cooper ... are you there? ... I left you a note,
didn't you read my note? ... I slipped it under your
door, you must have seen it ... well, I'm up here at One-
Eyed Jack's, and to be perfectly honest, I think I'm in a
little over my head ...
(fights off her tears)
Not that I can't handle it. I mean, if I'm going to help
you with your investigations, I'm sure I'll be put into
situations a lot dangerous than this on a fairly
regular basis. It's just, you know, the first time out I
wouldn't mind a little expert guidance ...
(changes positions)
Just so you know, there is a connection between Horne's
department store and One-Eyed Jack; it's my father. He
owns the place. A little ball of sleeze named Battis
recruits some of the girls at the perfume counter.
Tomorrow I'm going to try to find out if Laura and
Ronette came up here ...
(moving close to tears again)
I hope you won't think any less of me for trying to help
(more)

76. INT. COOPER'S ROOM - NIGHT
Cooper exits his bathroom, moving very stiffly. He sits painfully on the side of the bed and
takes a handful of aspirins with his glass of warm milk. He picks up his tape recorder.
COOPER
Diane, it's 11:55 p.m., approximately nineteen hours
since the shooting incident that nearly caused me to
make a premature purchase of the proverbial farm.
There's every reason to think I'll make a complete
recovery, which I would like to get a good jump out of
the blocks on by sleeping solidly for at least eight or
nine hours ... a man can only go so long without
submitting to a period of rest ...
As he speaks, he puts in his ear plugs.
COOPER (CONTINUED)
... for as we know from experiments performed on
American GI's during the Korean War, sleep deprivation
is a one-way ticket to temporary psychosis and I'm
working on a three day jag. I got so goofy last night as I
was lying here wondering whether I was going to live or
die that I thought I saw a giant in my room, but perhaps
I'll save that story for another time.
(a big yawn)
This is me, room 315 of the Great Northern Hotel,
signing off.
Cooper puts a sleep mask and turns off the lamp. He lies still for a moment. He thinks he
feels a weight settle on the end of the bed. He turns, senses sometrhing. He lifts the corner of
the sleep mask and sees ...
... the Giant is back. Sitting at the end of the bed.
GIANT
Sorry to wake you.
COOPER
I wasn't asleep. I'm not asleep. Then I'm not dreaming.

76. CONTINUED:
GIANT
I forgot to tell you something.
COOPER
You were right about Jacques. The big rubber bag.
GIANT
The things I tell you will not be wrong.
Cooper's about to ask another question. The Giant raises his huge hand to still him.
GIANT (CONTINUED)
Better to listen than to talk.
COOPER
I believe you.
GIANT
Don't search for all the answers at once. A path is
formed by laying one stone at a time.
Coopers nods.
GIANT (CONTINUED)
One person saw the Third Man. Three have seen him,
yes, but not his body. One only. Known to you. Ready
now to speak.
Coopers wants to speak, bites his tongue. Nods.
GIANT (CONTINUED)
One more thing. You forgot something.
COOPER
What?
The Giant waves goodbye to him.
Cooper leans over to turn on the lamp. The Giant is gone.
ANGLE: a wider shot of Cooper sitting up in bed, revealing the note left by Audrey,
large in foreground, either under the bed or on a table across the room.

FLASHBACK: Ronette's POV; sound and picture distorted and strange. We see what she

Laura kneeling nearby on the floor of the train car.
Two surgically gloved hands frantically forming a small mound of dirt.
Blood dripping.
A hand ripping the half-heart necklace from around Laura's neck.
A finger dipped in blood, writing the note.
A hand picking up a heavy wrench and advancing towards us.
And the wrench is raised threateningly above us.
And we see him. Bob, the grey-haired man. He swings the wrench down at us.
