REVISED: 2. EXT. SHERIFF'S STATION - DAY
REVISED: 3. INT. TRUMAN'S OFFICE
REVISED: ANGLE ON MRS. BRIGGS, sitting in a chair facing TRUMAN and COOPER.
REVISED: MRS. BRIGGS
REVISED: I don't want to alarm you overly. Garland has
REVISED: disappeared before. Granted it's always been work
REVISED: related. Agent Cooper, did this seem work related?
REVISED: M'am, that's very hard to say.
REVISED: So Betty you're saying this behavior is part of the way the
REVISED: Major operates.
REVISED: MRS. BRIGGS
REVISED: Let me ask you this: did he leave suddenly?
REVISED: Yes. We were speaking philosophically. Then I left the
REVISED: site to answer a call of nature. He was gone when I
REVISED: returned.
REVISED: MRS. BRIGGS
REVISED: The fact that you were in the woods is very significant.
REVISED: In what way?
REVISED: MRS. BRIGGS
REVISED: All I know is he talks about them constantly.
REVISED: In what way?
REVISED: #2.011 Revised 10-23-90, PINK
REVISED: MRS. BRIGGS
REVISED: Confidential ways.
REVISED: Betty, I'm afraid there's not much we can do now except
REVISED: keep an eye out. He can't be considered legally missing
REVISED: until after 24 hours.
REVISED: Be patient, Mrs. Briggs. Your husband has a renaissance
REVISED: passion for exploration. That approach creates its own
REVISED: schedules.
REVISED: MRS. BRIGGS
REVISED: That is how he sees himself. There's no manual for it;
REVISED: there's also no manual for being married to it.
REVISED: Garland left some brief notes on his nightstand. I'll call
REVISED: you back with them.
REVISED: That might be helpful.
REVISED: She exits.
REVISED: Harry, Major Briggs didn't wander off on some work
REVISED: assignment. That flash of light I saw signified a power; a
REVISED: force that lives in those woods.
REVISED: ANDY BRENNAN and HAWK enter carrying a small white department store box.
REVISED: Sheriff, we found Mr. and Mrs. Milford their wedding
REVISED: gifts. It's a matching scarf and ascot set.
REVISED: Andy digs into the white box and pulls out two loud, almost road-kill plaid scarves.
REVISED: Can't believe he's getting married again.
REVISED: We should just recycle gifts from the last wedding.
REVISED: Dougie's weddings are a seasonal thing. Like the return
REVISED: of the salmon.
REVISED: #2.011 Revised 10-23-90, PINK
REVISED: Marry in haste, repent in leisure.
REVISED: The INTERCOM sounds.
REVISED: There's a call for a Dale Crewper ... long distance. Hope
REVISED: I didn't cut it off.
REVISED: Temp.
REVISED: Truman flips on the speaker phone. A moment passes. GORDON COLE.
REVISED: HARRY, COOP? ARE WE THERE? THIS IS
REVISED: GORDON COLE CALLING FROM BEND,
REVISED: OREGON.
REVISED: We know, Gordon. How are you?
REVISED: COOP, I JUST CALLED TO SAY THAT YOU
REVISED: INVESTIGATION BUSINESS. THESE ARE
REVISED: HARD TIMES. WE GET THROUGH THEM.
REVISED: Thanks, Gordon.
REVISED: IT RANKS POOR WITH ME, TOO. NOW COOP,
REVISED: IS ANY OF THIS TRUE? DOUBLE HOMOCIDE?
REVISED: STOLEN DRUGS? STORMING A
REVISED: WHOREHOUSE?
REVISED: Gordon, it's a bunch of hogwash
REVISED: ENFORCEMENT AGENCY'S STARTING TO

REVISED: NOSE AROUND. THEY'RE SENDING DOWN A
REVISED: ANGLE.
REVISED: Who is it? ... WHO'S THE AGENT?
REVISED: DENNIS BRYSON.
REVISED: He's a good man, Harry. No nonsense.
REVISED: Under which, HAWK enters.
REVISED: Cooper, they're ready for you in the hearing.
REVISED: That's it, Gordon. TIME TO FACE THE MUSIC.
REVISED: DON'T LET'EM RATTLE YOU, COOP. THESE
REVISED: OTHER PEOPLE'S DRAWERS. WE'VE ALL HAD
REVISED: OUR SOCKS TOSSED AROUND. CATCH YOU
REVISED: LATER.
REVISED: Cole hangs up without fan fare. Cooper returns the receiver. Exchanges a look with Truman.
REVISED: Wish me luck. CUT TO:
REVISED: 4. INT. CONFERENCE ROOM
REVISED: Sitting at the conference table is ROGER HARDY. On each side of him are TWO MEN in
REVISED: slate suits, with eyes as even as colored water. Before Hardy is an open folder, Cooper's
REVISED: badge, I.D. and gun. Cooper enters, closes the door and sits down. On the table between him
REVISED: and these three men sit three dark blue fedora hats.
REVISED: Roger.
REVISED: Dale.
REVISED: A beat. The two underlings sit as still as bookends.
REVISED: Showtime, Agent Cooper. You've heard the charges.
REVISED: 4. CONTINUED:
REVISED: What do you wish to present in your defense?
REVISED: I have no defense.
REVISED: The two operatives look over at Hardy, who stares inquisitively at Cooper. The man on
REVISED: Hardy's left, whose job it is to record testimony, tentatively takes down this response.
REVISED: I'm completely confident in the rightness of my actions.
REVISED: Some of it went down outside bureau stipulations, yes, I
REVISED: accept that and I'll pay the price. But I'm innocent of
REVISED: any criminal wrong doing. If they wish to charge me I'll
REVISED: defend myself in a court of law.
REVISED: Close the book.
REVISED: Dale, there's a right way and a wrong way to do this. And
REVISED: the first thing we expect a bureau man to do is stand up
REVISED: for himself. A man who can't, who doesn't even try, may
REVISED: be packing feathers where his spine's supposed to be.
REVISED: Roger, I know the move I'm supposed to make. And I
REVISED: know the board.
REVISED: So ...
REVISED: I've done a lot of thinking. And I've started to focus out
REVISED: beyond the end of the board. On a bigger game.
REVISED: What 'game'?
REVISED: The sound wind makes through the pines. The sentience
REVISED: of animals. The last thought of a homeless man before he
REVISED: takes a night's sleep. What we fear in the dark. And
REVISED: what's beyond the dark.
REVISED: What the hell are you talking about?
REVISED: #2.011 Revised 10-23-90, PINK
REVISED: 4. CONTINUED:
REVISED: I'm talking about seeing beyond fear, Roger. About
REVISED: looking at the world with love.
REVISED: Cooper, you're liable to be extradited for murder and
REVISED: drug trafficking -
REVISED: That's something I can't control -
REVISED: Your suspension will continue in force. The next moves
REVISED: are the Canadian government's and a DEA investigation,
REVISED: which begins today.
REVISED: You've cracked a big case. You've been under a lot of
REVISED: pressure. I may recommend a full psychological work-up.
REVISED: Thank you for your candor, Roger. So long fellas.
REVISED: Cooper stands, looks over at his gun, badge and I.D. card, and starts away. ANGLE ON
REVISED: those objects, still sitting on the table, as we HEAR the door shut.
REVISED: 5. EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - DAY
REVISED: 6. OMITTED
REVISED: 7. INT. WEIGHT ROOM
REVISED: Now changed into his wrestling sweats, Mike joins other TEAM MEMBERS gathered around
REVISED: the weight machines, exchanging a few perfunctory greetings before going over to a seat at the
REVISED: leg press machine. Hyperventilating in preparation, he looks up at his buddies, who are
REVISED: looking back at him with curiously broad adolescent grins.
REVISED: His sudden premonition of dread is answered by the bluejeaned figure dropping down into the
REVISED: neighboring machine seat; she sets the weight before allowing herself to peek over.
REVISED: Hi, Mike.
REVISED: 7. CONTINUED:
REVISED: Mike turns his head in dismay. He is both supremely irritated by, and unequipped to deal
REVISED: with, this bizarre new shadow in his life. The guys are choking back amusement.
REVISED: Hello.
REVISED: How are you?
REVISED: Just great. Listen, is there something you want?
REVISED: Now, Mike ... aren't we being a little forward?
REVISED: Nonplussed, Mike starts working the leg extensions. It's all Nadine can do to keep her eyes
REVISED: off him. With the half-hearted dissemblance of a schoolgirl, she also starts doing leg presses;
REVISED: but she is doing them with six hundred pounds of weight.
REVISED: The guys have stopped kidding. The room is virtually silent but for the lifting and pounding
REVISED: down of weight when the WRESTLING COACH robustly enters.
REVISED: Thattaway, Nelson ... I keep telling you guys, it's leg
REVISED: power that wins matches ....
REVISED: He then pulls up to a stunned shuffle, seeing the magazine next to Mike's is hoisting double the
REVISED: weight. Being a coach, he is quick to recover.
REVISED: And what's your name, little lady?
REVISED: Nadine Butler.
REVISED: Tell me, Nadine ...
REVISED: ... ever give any thought to going out for the wrestling
REVISED: team?
REVISED: ANGLE ON Mike: will there be no escape from this girl?
REVISED: 8. EXT. ROADSIDE BAR - DAY
REVISED: neon shingle that reads, "The Broken Bones". Parked in the foreground is an old white Corvette
REVISED: convertible with a weather-worn red interior.
REVISED: 9. INT. ROADSIDE BAR
REVISED: Dark. Near empty. Clearly a place that lives on night receipts and stray afternoon beers. The
REVISED: BARTENDER steals a glance over at his only customer, an intent, demure BLONDE in a
REVISED: purple silk jacket, mid-twenties. A wistful sadness clings to her like perfume.
REVISED: JAMES HURLEY enters, takes a seat two down and orders a beer. It arrives. The bartender
REVISED: fades into the background. James takes a long first drink, aware he's being watched.
REVISED: Hi.
REVISED: He moves his head a quarter turn, sees her through one eye and looks back into his beer.
REVISED: H'lo.
REVISED: She kills the rest of a tequila, ice. There's another waiting beside it:
REVISED: Headed somewhere?
REVISED: I'm sorry?
REVISED: Is is someplace you're going or running from?
REVISED: You got it all wrong. I'm alright.
REVISED: Men are always alright. Right up until they pull the
REVISED: trigger.
REVISED: The bartender snorts his amusement. Her return look pushes him further into the background.
REVISED: Then the neighbors march solemnly out to the news
REVISED: cameras to tell us, "He was such a nice, quiet guy."
REVISED: I'm only quiet on the outside.
REVISED: I can almost hear what's inside from here.
REVISED: He relapses into a characteristic silence; feeling she's been a little harsh on this stranger, her
REVISED: manner softens.
REVISED: #2.011 Revised 10-23-90, PINK
REVISED: 9. CONTINUED:
REVISED: There was a woman involved.
REVISED: A few of them. Actually.
REVISED: So you were outnumbered. We don't fight fair.
REVISED: 'Live nearby?
REVISED: Twin Peaks.
REVISED: That's a nice jacket.
REVISED: I'm glad you think so. Can you ... do anything with cars?
REVISED: Sure. 'Having problems with that Corvette?
REVISED: No. While he was away on business, I foolishly took my
REVISED: husband's Dusenburg out on the road. Someone squeezed
REVISED: me on the highway, I ran it into a ditch. It would be a
REVISED: very good idea for me to have the car repaired before my
REVISED: husband, comes home.
REVISED: I could take a look.
REVISED: My name's James.
REVISED: Evelyn. Evelyn Marsh.
REVISED: I live just up the road.
REVISED: In the silence, he hears her legs crossing under the bar.
REVISED: We in a hurry?
REVISED: Mind if I play the box first?
REVISED: 9. CONTINUED:
REVISED: I don't exactly punch a clock, myself.
REVISED: James slowly steps over to the jukebox. Something about this offer feels like more than it says
REVISED: it is. He puts on a slow, soulful song about a wasted, violet life.
REVISED: As James stands in the jukebox light looking for his next selection, the CAMERA recedes,
REVISED: leaving them to the music, the dark empty bar, the bartender cleaning glasses.

FADE OUT: 10. INT. SHERIFF'S STATION RECEPTION - DAY
FADE OUT: ANDY BRENNAN is practicing his gun draw, taking aim at a calendar. We hear NOISE
FADE OUT: from an entryway. Andy turns, lowered gun still absent-mindedly in hand, to see RICHARD
FADE OUT: TREMAYNE entering with 'little brother', NICKY, a wide-eyed vulnerable-looking little
FADE OUT: boy. Both are staring at the gun, which Andy holsters then extends a greeting to rival suitor.
FADE OUT: Good day, Dick.
FADE OUT: Hello, Andy. This is Little Nicky, my charge from
FADE OUT: Happy Helping Hand. Nicky, this is Deputy Andy.
FADE OUT: How do you do, young fella.
FADE OUT: Hi.
FADE OUT: Andrew, old boy, Nicky and I just stopped off at
FADE OUT: Horne's for a new wardrobe, we're just on our way for a
FADE OUT: malted and we were hoping Lucy could join us.
FADE OUT: Oh shoot, Dick, Lucy's up at the Great Northern today
FADE OUT: helping with the Milford wedding.
FADE OUT: Oh God,. that 's right; Dougie's getting married again.
FADE OUT: Lucy's not here?
FADE OUT: Yes, unfortunately we'll have to meet Lucy another time.
FADE OUT: Nicky realizes his dread: another abandonment. He looks up anxiously.
FADE OUT: But you, you promised. Where is she?
FADE OUT: I'm afraid Lucy's very busy right now and doesn't have
FADE OUT: time for us.
FADE OUT: More resonance. The child begins lightly, silently crying. This is too much for Andy.
FADE OUT: #2.011 Revised 10-23-90, PINK
FADE OUT: 10. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: You know, Dick this is just about my lunch hour ... and if
FADE OUT: you'd like, Nicky, I'd sure enjoy taking you two guys out
FADE OUT: for a malted. How would that be?
FADE OUT: Oh boy!
FADE OUT: A look of gratitude, mixed with a little suspicion from Treymayne.
FADE OUT: 10A. INT. TRUMAN'S OFFICE - DAY
FADE OUT: Hawk and Truman enter to find Cooper, pouring coffee from a pitcher on Truman's desk.
FADE OUT: Harry. Nine years ago I joined the bureau because I felt
FADE OUT: it was the strongest statement I could make about the man
FADE OUT: I wanted to become and the world I wanted to live in.
FADE OUT: And now, suddenly all that's brushed aside. I have
FADE OUT: absolutely no responsiblities. Nothing to do. And it
FADE OUT: feels ...
FADE OUT: ... fantastic.
FADE OUT: Cooper sips from his cup. Looks up at Truman with a disbelieving stare; then suddenly spits
FADE OUT: coffee halfway across the room. Truman shakes his head in amusement.
FADE OUT: Temp. Lucy's helping out with the Milford wedding.
FADE OUT: Sorry about that.
FADE OUT: That's alright. We still need to clean up Hawk's.
FADE OUT: Drain water.
FADE OUT: #2.011 Revised 10-1-8-90, BLUE
FADE OUT: 10A. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: Coop ... what will you do if you can't clear yourself?
FADE OUT: Harry, last night, Major Briggs planted a seed in my
FADE OUT: mind. And it's been germinating. The idea that by
FADE OUT: focusing on our fears or desires about something, we give
FADE OUT: them tremendous power. Consider this, Harry: perhaps
FADE OUT: by our best-intentioned resistance of evil, we somehow
FADE OUT: unknowingly join hands with it. Perpetuate it.
FADE OUT: And now, being suspended, I'm suddenly empowered to
FADE OUT: let go of my preoccupation with wrongdoing. I feel like
FADE OUT: I've been exiled back to the natural rhythms of life.
FADE OUT: Well, if you ever come to feel you need a home base,
FADE OUT: there'll always be a job for you here in Twin Peaks.
FADE OUT: Harry, in a world of continuing disorder, you are a rock.
FADE OUT: Oh, Mrs. Briggs called. The notes beside Major Briggs's
FADE OUT: bed? A rather detailed grocery list and a small
FADE OUT: endearment. Nothing more.
FADE OUT: Hawk, Harry have either of you ever heard of a place
FADE OUT: called the White Lodge.
FADE OUT: Can't say that I have.
FADE OUT: Hawk's initial reply is a look of concern.
FADE OUT: Where did you hear of it?
FADE OUT: It was the last thing Major Briggs mentioned before he
FADE OUT: disappeared. You know of it?
FADE OUT: Cooper, you may be fearless in this world. But there are
FADE OUT: other worlds.
FADE OUT: Tell me more.
FADE OUT: #2.011 Revised 10-23-90, PINK
FADE OUT: 10A. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: Local legend. The White Lodge is a place where the
FADE OUT: spirits that rule man and nature here reside.
FADE OUT: That's a place I'd like to see.
FADE OUT: Many have tried. They say it exists only on the spiritual
FADE OUT: plane.
FADE OUT: Maybe I'd better pull up a chair.
FADE OUT: There is also a legend of a place called The Black Lodge:
FADE OUT: the shadow self of the White Lodge, a place of dark
FADE OUT: forces that pull on this world. A world of nightmares:
FADE OUT: shamans reduced to crying children; angry spirits pouring
FADE OUT: from the woods; graves opening like flowers.
FADE OUT: Dangerous.
FADE OUT: The legend says every spirit must pass through there on
FADE OUT: the path to perfection. There you will meet your own
FADE OUT: shadow self. My people call it the Dweller on the
FADE OUT: Threshold. But it is said that if you confront the Black
FADE OUT: Lodge with imperfect courage, it will utterly annihilate
FADE OUT: your soul.
FADE OUT: Holy Smokes.
FADE OUT: Just then: an intercom BUZZ. The temp's vaguely confused VOICE is heard:
FADE OUT: TEMP'S VOICE
FADE OUT: Agent Crewper? Agent Bryson here to see you.
FADE OUT: Dennis and I worked together in Oakland a couple years
FADE OUT: back. Broke a smuggling ring. One of the finest minds in
FADE OUT: the DEA, Harry. We're in good hands.
FADE OUT: #2.011 Revised 10-18-90, BLUE
FADE OUT: 10A. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: A KNOCK is heard. All turn toward the door.
FADE OUT: Coop?
FADE OUT: They look up: leaning fetchingly against the doorframe is a thin MAN in an Ann Taylor suit.
FADE OUT: Long skirt. Light makeup.
FADE OUT: ... Dennis?
FADE OUT: It's a long story, but I prefer Denise if you don't mind.
FADE OUT: Okay. This is Sheriff Truman. Deputy Hawk.
FADE OUT: Pleased. Denise Bryson, Drug Enforcement Agency.
FADE OUT: Oblivious to the stares, Bryson sits and opens his briefcase. He is clearly business first.
FADE OUT: Nice ride out here ... hard to believe you even have any
FADE OUT: crime, Sheriff, I picture you chasing lost dogs, locking
FADE OUT: up the town drunk ...
FADE OUT: It's a little more involved.
FADE OUT: Let's move right through this, Dale. The DEA's interest
FADE OUT: stems from allegations made by an RCMP officer that
FADE OUT: you stole drugs being used by him in a sting operation.
FADE OUT: Patently untrue: Denise, I believe I'm being set up.
FADE OUT: My recent experience has taught me never to judge too
FADE OUT: quickly.
FADE OUT: I'll get right to work on this and be back to you later
FADE OUT: today. I understand we're both staying at the Great
FADE OUT: #2.011 Revised 10-18-90, BLUE
FADE OUT: 10A. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: Northern. How's the food up there?
FADE OUT: You're in for a real surprise.
FADE OUT: So are they.
FADE OUT: Let's catch up later. I want to tell you all about my new
FADE OUT: life.
FADE OUT: Pleasure to meet you, Sheriff. Deputy.
FADE OUT: Denise goes. Cooper, Truman and Hawk. A long beat.
FADE OUT: That's a good color for him.
FADE OUT: 11. INT. HIGH SCHOOL CORRIDOR - DAY
FADE OUT: NADINE, in a whirl of adolescent energy, spots DONNA HAYWARD at her locker and
FADE OUT: hurries over to corner her.
FADE OUT: Donna, hi ...
FADE OUT: Hi, Nadine. Have you heard anything from James?
FADE OUT: You mean Ed's friend, with the motorcycle?
FADE OUT: Yes.
FADE OUT: He hasn't come around for a couple of days, listen, I
FADE OUT: #2.011 Revised 10-23-90, PINK
FADE OUT: 11. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: gotta ask you something, I hope you won't think this is
FADE OUT: too personal ...
FADE OUT: What?
FADE OUT: Are you like, still going out with, you know, Mike or
FADE OUT: anything?
FADE OUT: No.
FADE OUT: Oh, yea.
FADE OUT: Why?
FADE OUT: You have to promise to say anything, promise, okay?
FADE OUT: I think there may be some major chemistry developing ...
FADE OUT: omi God, there he is.
FADE OUT: Mike approaches, Nadine hurries to him, girlishly leans into his path.
FADE OUT: Hi, Mike. Guess who's thinking about going out for the
FADE OUT: wrestling team?
FADE OUT: Donna looks over at Mike; this can't be true. Wrestling? Mike shrugs back in the affirmative.
FADE OUT: I promise to take it easy on you in practice.
FADE OUT: Mike, who's had enough, smiles acidly and moves on. Nadine watches hungrily.
FADE OUT: Look at those buns. Cowabunga.
FADE OUT: Nadine ... what about Ed?
FADE OUT: Aren't you ... still seeing him?
FADE OUT: Yeah, sorta.
FADE OUT: #2.011 Revised 10-23-90, PINK
FADE OUT: 11. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: Well ... if you're seeing Ed, how can you, you know, start
FADE OUT: seeing Mike?
FADE OUT: Ed's at home. Mike's at school. Ed stays in. Mike likes
FADE OUT: to go out. And let's be realistic. Sometimes Ed acts like
FADE OUT: he's old enough to be my father. Catch you later.
FADE OUT: That one loses Donna completely. Nadine scampers off.
FADE OUT: 12. INT. TRUMAN'S CABIN - AFTERNOON
FADE OUT: JOSIE'S sitting up in bed, finishing her lunch. Truman sits at her bedside.
FADE OUT: All right. It's time you tell me where you've been and
FADE OUT: what you've been through. I have to know the truth. I
FADE OUT: can't go on doing this, being with you unless I know.
FADE OUT: Harry ...
FADE OUT: He takes her hand gently but firmly away from his face.
FADE OUT: The truth.
FADE OUT: I used to work for a man in Hong Kong. His name is
FADE OUT: Thomas Eckhardt. He ... helped me. He took me off the
FADE OUT: streets when I was sixteen. If you're from a poor family,
FADE OUT: sometimes they ... sell the female children. I was lucky.
FADE OUT: Truman struggles to keep his emotional resolve.
FADE OUT: He taught me about life and he taught me about business.
FADE OUT: He was my father. My master. My lover. I never
FADE OUT: questioned him or anything he did. Then a day came
FADE OUT: when I learned too much. He had a man killed, a business
FADE OUT: partner who had wronged him. Murdered. I saw it done.
FADE OUT: Did you go to the police?
FADE OUT: 12. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: He owns the police. When I met Andrew Packard I was
FADE OUT: already afraid for my life. Andrew was also a business
FADE OUT: partner. He was good and kind, and when he asked me to
FADE OUT: marry him, I said yes, to come with him, and to get away
FADE OUT: from Eckhardt.
FADE OUT: Who was this Mr. Lee? Your "cousin?"
FADE OUT: Harry, I'm sorry. I was trying to keep you out of this.
FADE OUT: The less you know the better -
FADE OUT: Who was he?
FADE OUT: That man works for Eckhardt. And he said if I didn't go
FADE OUT: back with him he would kill you.
FADE OUT: Why?
FADE OUT: Because Eckhardt wants me. He's never stopped wanting
FADE OUT: me. He think I'm his property. When Andrew was alive
FADE OUT: he could protect me. I now believe Eckhardt is the man
FADE OUT: responsible for Andrew's death.
FADE OUT: Jonathan was driving me to the airport in Seattle. I
FADE OUT: jumped out of the car. I'd rather die. I'd rather die than
FADE OUT: go back to that monster ...
FADE OUT: Josie, stop. You're here with me.
FADE OUT: Now he'll kill both of us.
FADE OUT: Truman takes her in his arms. Quiet. Determined.
FADE OUT: Let him try.

FADE OUT: Andy, Tremayne, and Little Nicky sit together at the counter. Nicky seated angelically,
FADE OUT: between them. Norma enters, pours a refill, spots a new customer seated nearby. Roger
FADE OUT: Hardy looks up from his newspaper.
FADE OUT: May I help you?
FADE OUT: I'd like a cup of coffee, please. And some of that pie I
FADE OUT: keep hearing about.
FADE OUT: Coming up. You won't be disappointed.
FADE OUT: Norma turns to go. But familiar voices catch her attention. HANK and ERNIE enter,
FADE OUT: singing a hunting song, spirited and sleepless from the expedition. Ernie looks far the more
FADE OUT: worn; he as clearly had his clock cleaned by a thorough professional.
FADE OUT: Hello, sunshine. Can we get some coffee?
FADE OUT: Hank drifts toward the back, Ernie drops onto a counter seat, where Norma immediately
FADE OUT: draws him some coffee. Ernie trombones into a handkefchief.
FADE OUT: How was the hunting expedition? Catch anything?
FADE OUT: Hope not.
FADE OUT: Catch anything? I came across a twelve-point buck
FADE OUT: standing by a deepwater stream; looked me right in the
FADE OUT: eye, wouldn't budge. Almost like he was toying with
FADE OUT: me. I made a soft approach, lined him up dead center
FADE OUT: and...
FADE OUT: A steady eye. A steady hand. That's the secret.
FADE OUT: She hands him his coffee, smelling more bourbon on him than bush. Knows he's lying.

FADE OUT: You should have taken along a camera. Is it being

FADE OUT: Ah ... yes, probably as we speak. It was great. Just great.
FADE OUT: Well, I'm going back to check in on your momma.
FADE OUT: She went back to Seattle.
FADE OUT: Seattle?
FADE OUT: That's where you should go, too.

FADE OUT: Hank returns from the back. Ernie pulls away from Norma.
FADE OUT: Take care, Ernie.
FADE OUT: Hey, buddy, what's with the long puss.
FADE OUT: Vivian's gone back to Seattle.
FADE OUT: Better for you, buckeroo. You've got four kilos to unload,
FADE OUT: you don't want the ball and chain getting in the way, do you?
FADE OUT: I suppose not.
FADE OUT: Better hit the phones, Hot Rod. We're on a deadline.
FADE OUT: Ernie starts unenthusiastically toward the pay phone; Hank heads back to the kitchen. PICK
FADE OUT: UP Norma as she delivers their orders to little Nicky, Andy and Treymayne.
FADE OUT: Two coffees, two pieces of three-berry pie ...
FADE OUT: How much does that cost?
FADE OUT: I'm sure I don't know. And one super snow-frosted Twin
FADE OUT: Peaks DoubleR chocolate malted.
FADE OUT: Looks just like White Tail Mountain, doesn't it Nicky?
FADE OUT: With a sudden burst from his little lungs, Nicky blows fiercely at the cream, causing it to fly
FADE OUT: up into Andy's face. Tremayne laughs like a hyena. Andy fumbles for some napkins.
FADE OUT: Sorry, Uncle Andy.
FADE OUT: Andy smiles. Uncle. Who could not love this kid?
FADE OUT: Now you look like White Tail Mountain, Andrew.
FADE OUT: Looks like you got a little on you too, Nicholas. We

FADE OUT: don't want to filthy up that stylish little shirt.
FADE OUT: Tremayne reaches across Nicky to the napkin dispenser. Nicky begins rolling the base of his
FADE OUT: malted along its circumference, like a tiring spun coin, then accidentally lets it drop forward,
FADE OUT: spilling his malted all over the extended left arm of Tremayne's natty, expensive sport coat.
FADE OUT: Damn it! Damn it!
FADE OUT: Nicky immediately begins to cry.
FADE OUT: That's okay. It's fine, Nicky. It's completely all right.
FADE OUT: Tremayne reaches over the counter for some more serious cleanup materials. Andy leans away
FADE OUT: from the chocolate spreading over the counter to lunge for some napkins. Little Nicky, with
FADE OUT: slightly unexpected strength gives Andy's stool a mighty spin. Still facing away from them
FADE OUT: as he cleans himself off, Andy lowers himself back onto the edge of his seat, hits the spinning
FADE OUT: stool and flies directly to the floor. Norma and Tremayne look up from their mopwork.
FADE OUT: CLOSE ON Nicky, his cherubic face still streaked with whipped cream, the slight upward
FADE OUT: curve of his lips suggesting a tiny, unsettling smile.

FADE OUT: 16. INT. OPEN GARAGE - DAY
FADE OUT: James and Evelyn stand beside her husband's Dusenberg up on blocks.
FADE OUT: I got a garage man to come out yesterday. Not that I
FADE OUT: understood a single word he said. Something vague about
FADE OUT: the front axle? He said he'll have to order it from God
FADE OUT: knows where.
FADE OUT: Germany. Your garage man's playing it safe. I can put
FADE OUT: this right. God, it's really beautiful.
FADE OUT: She comes around closer, half-curious.
FADE OUT: Jeffrey loves this car. My husband. Loves the car.

FADE OUT: 16. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: Where is your husband, Mrs. Marsh?
FADE OUT: I'm not sure this week. He travels extensively. Business.
FADE OUT: The car was built in 1923. Jeffrey has to have the most
FADE OUT: unique and beautiful toys. And they have to be perfect.
FADE OUT: He's that way about everything he owns.
FADE OUT: I could have learned something from that; if I'd been
FADE OUT: paying attention.
FADE OUT: Are you that way, James? ... About your bike?
FADE OUT: Guess I'm not so interested in how my bike looks as I am
FADE OUT: in where it can take me.
FADE OUT: Where do you want to go?
FADE OUT: It's not a place. It's a feeling.
FADE OUT: (coming up from the car, looking out at the
FADE OUT: road)
FADE OUT: Sometimes riding at night, I punch off my headlight, turn
FADE OUT: up the throttle and just go for it.
FADE OUT: So ... think you can fix it?
FADE OUT: Sure.
FADE OUT: There's a room above the garage. You can stay there while
FADE OUT: you work. If you like. Room and board. Whatever else
FADE OUT: you think is fair. I really do need to have it done before
FADE OUT: Jeffrey returns.
FADE OUT: I'd like you to stay, James. I'd enjoy the company.
FADE OUT: Okay.
FADE OUT: Good. It's settled then. I'll leave you to it.

FADE OUT: at her tone, and what he might be getting himself into.
FADE OUT: 17. INT. BEN HORNE'S OFFICE - DAY
FADE OUT: START CLOSE on a projector screen surrounded by darkness. Flickering before us is silent
FADE OUT: footage of Ben as a young boy, eagerly witnessing a groundbreaking ceremony. Images of
FADE OUT: young Ben, Jerry, their bearded FATHER, dance across the screen. Horne Sr. shoves a spade
FADE OUT: into the ground, unearths the ceremonial soil. All clap and celebrate. Smiles abound. In a
FADE OUT: background a large sign proclaims: FUTURE SITE OF THE GREAT NORTHERN HOTEL.
FADE OUT: It's a sentimental journey back to a simpler time and place.
FADE OUT: PULL BACK from the screen into the darkened office, shades drawn, to Ben, seated in the
FADE OUT: screen's reflected light watching his old glory days, sipping from a crystal glass, a nearly
FADE OUT: empty bourbon bottle beside him, cigar smoke snaking up through the projector's beam. Then,
FADE OUT: quietly at first, eyes fixed upon the screen ... Ben recites:
FADE OUT: "Now is the winter of our discontent/Made glorious
FADE OUT: summer by this sun of York; And in all the clouds that
FADE OUT: lour'd upon our house/In the deep bosom of the ocean
FADE OUT: buried./Now are our brows bound with victorious
FADE OUT: wreaths; Our bruised arms hung up for monuments; Our
FADE OUT: stern alarums changed to merry meetings; Our dreadful
FADE OUT: marches to delightful measures."
FADE OUT: A door opens. The silhouette in the doorway causes Ben to immediately douse the projector
FADE OUT: and turn on his desk lamp. On the desk are a box of kleenex and several silver gravity toys.
FADE OUT: Hank enters.
FADE OUT: A stag party. And I wasn't even invited.
FADE OUT: Hank, where have you been?
FADE OUT: Ben, I have had an absolutely killer schedule.
FADE OUT: Do you know what kind of hell I've been through the last
FADE OUT: few days? You said you took care of Catherine in the
FADE OUT: mill fire: she's alive. And as you might imagine, not
FADE OUT: happy about it. Through extortion and trickery, she's now
FADE OUT: managed to cheat me out of both Ghostwood and the
FADE OUT: mill. And then there's the small matter of my being
FADE OUT: arrested for killing Laura Palmer, a real business-
FADE OUT: enhancer, on top of which my trusted solicitor, the late
FADE OUT: Leland Palmer turns out to a homocidal lunatic!

FADE OUT: Ben's eye is drawn to Laura's picture on his desk. He grows somber.
FADE OUT: Tough week, Ben.
FADE OUT: Do you think the furniture in this room is arranged
FADE OUT: adequately? I've been toying with the notion that if one
FADE OUT: could find the proper spatial relationship between all the
FADE OUT: objects in a given space, it could create a resonance the
FADE OUT: benefits of which to the individual dwelling in that space
FADE OUT: could be extensive and far reaching. Help me move this
FADE OUT: desk, would you?
FADE OUT: Ben asks for a hand with the desk.
FADE OUT: That's fascinating, Ben, really, listen, though, what we
FADE OUT: have to do now is talk about One-Eyed Jacks.
FADE OUT: Jacks, yes, One-Eyed Jacks, uh-huh.
FADE OUT: Here's how it is, Ben. Ben, you're out.
FADE OUT: Excuse me? I own One-Eyed Jack's.
FADE OUT: There's been a friendly takeover.
FADE OUT: You walk in here under my employ and have the gall -
FADE OUT: Oh, that's another thing. I don't work for you anymore.
FADE OUT: Renault. Jean Renault. It's Renault, isn't it?
FADE OUT: Hank, that man is a psychopath. A psychopath! You're

FADE OUT: You think I'm going to sit here and take this lying down?
FADE OUT: Ben. Life is change Listen to me when I tell you this is
FADE OUT: how it's going to be -
FADE OUT: Don't patronize me, you goon.
FADE OUT: Hank steps forward and gives Ben a long look. A Hank special. The room's power shifts.
FADE OUT: Look at you. You're a mess. You screwed up, boss man.
FADE OUT: You're out, Ben.
FADE OUT: Hank exits. Ben glares at the door, then glances over at the burbon bottle. The blank
FADE OUT: projector screen, the hum of the projector. He pours himself a drink, slouches back in the chair,
FADE OUT: bathed in the light of the projector. A beat. Ben manages a bizarre smile and makes shadow
FADE OUT: puppets on the wall. Little dancing rabbits for his own amusement
FADE OUT: 18. INT. GREAT NORTHERN LOBBY - DAY
FADE OUT: Wedding preparations are in evidence. A bad ACCORDIAN PLAYER is warming up in
FADE OUT: background. Cooper enters, makes his way to the front desk to collect his mail.

FADE OUT: Cooper enters his hotel room, notices a larger envelope among the others. He opens it. Inside
FADE OUT: is a micro-cassette and a card that reads: P to Q4
FADE OUT: Windom Earle.
FADE OUT: Cooper quickly takes out his recorder. He pops the tape in and hits play and listens with
FADE OUT: growing horror ...

FADE OUT: WINDOM EARLE'S VOICE
FADE OUT: Of course you couldn't help but take note of my
FADE OUT: emphatically traditional opening. I must say your
FADE OUT: responding move was nothing if not reflective of your
FADE OUT: predeliction for the tidy and fastidious. See how my
FADE OUT: response to you begins to lead us towards a classical
FADE OUT: confrontation? But there's doubt in your mind: what are
FADE OUT: my true intentions? How will you answer this time?
FADE OUT: Hobgoblins, Dale; consistency, predictibility, giving rise
FADE OUT: to patterns. We both know only too well how these
FADE OUT: patterns leave you vulnerable to attack. You with your
FADE OUT: wounds. I with mine. Let me paint you a picture. My
FADE OUT: knights will skirmish. Lanes of power and influence will
FADE OUT: open to my bishops and rooks. Pawns will naturally be
FADE OUT: forfeit. I'm even prepared to sacrifice my queen because
FADE OUT: I assure you, dear Dale, my goal will be attained at any

FADE TO BLACK: 19. INT. GREAT NORTHERN DINING ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON
FADE TO BLACK: Before the fireplace, the wedding ceremony of DOUGIE and LANA BUDDING is in
FADE TO BLACK: progress. Steady and easy, Dougie stands in a herringbone sports jacket and evergreen slacks.
FADE TO BLACK: Lana, her full body alight with flows of white and pink chiffon, looks something like an
FADE TO BLACK: exploding birthday cake.
FADE TO BLACK: The REVEREND performs the ceremony with a respectful air, seemingly dissembling his
FADE TO BLACK: own skepticism. The best man is PETE MARTELL; the maid of honor AUDREY HORNE.
FADE TO BLACK: Beyond them is a half-moon gallery seated in Great Northern dining chairs, with no separation
FADE TO BLACK: based on family . Some of those seated are Truman, Andy, Hawk, LOG
FADE TO BLACK: LADY, and a disgusted DWAYNE MILFORD, patting the hand of an older, blue-haired
FADE TO BLACK: WOMAN. Her stone-face suggests she is less than thrilled with the ongoing nuptials.
FADE TO BLACK: Do you, Douglas Milford, take this woman to be your
FADE TO BLACK: wife, to love and cherish, for as long as you both shall live.
FADE TO BLACK: You bet, Reverend.
FADE TO BLACK: And do you, Lana Budding, take this man to be your
FADE TO BLACK: husband, to love honor and obey, so long as you both shall
FADE TO BLACK: live?
FADE TO BLACK: I do, your Honor.
FADE TO BLACK: If there be anyone here who knows not why this union
FADE TO BLACK: should be made, let him speak now or forever hold his -
FADE TO BLACK: You're damned straight I object - that little
FADE TO BLACK: golddigger's after his money, his publishing empire, and
FADE TO BLACK: God knows what else - look at him, he's already got one
FADE TO BLACK: foot in the grave!
FADE TO BLACK: Truman and Hawk quickly hustle Dwayne off into the background.
FADE TO BLACK: Okay, easy there, Mr. Mayor.

FADE TO BLACK: Don't give it another thought, doll.
FADE TO BLACK: So if there are no further objections ...
FADE TO BLACK: 20. INT. COOPER'S ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON
FADE TO BLACK: Cooper stands at his window, tape machine in hand.
FADE TO BLACK: Diane, I am standing at the window of my room at the
FADE TO BLACK: Great Northern, looking down at the wedding of Dougie
FADE TO BLACK: Milford and his youthful bride. The ceremony appears
FADE TO BLACK: quite simple; the groom, commencing his fifth marriage,
FADE TO BLACK: has apparently honed the procedure down to the bone.
FADE TO BLACK: The reception will be starting shortly and a good deal of
FADE TO BLACK: alcohol will undoubtedly be consumed in order to
FADE TO BLACK: accomodate our culturally prevelant rally discomfort with
FADE TO BLACK: mystery and ritual.
FADE TO BLACK: (turns from window, sets down recorder, begins
FADE TO BLACK: to dress, speaks while peering in mirror)
FADE TO BLACK: Diane, I anticipate your question. I am not down among
FADE TO BLACK: the revelers because my mind is burdened with questions:
FADE TO BLACK: what's become of Major Briggs? What is the true
FADE TO BLACK: significance of the White and Black Lodge? Has the
FADE TO BLACK: Major, clearly a man of no small spiritual advancement,
FADE TO BLACK: perhaps been attempting to make contact with some
FADE TO BLACK: element of these places in his top-secret work? Briggs is a
FADE TO BLACK: man of clear eye and deep thought; he sees right through
FADE TO BLACK: the illusory texture of this world and fluently reads
FADE TO BLACK: beneath it. You might meet a handful like him in a
FADE TO BLACK: lifetime. But if what Hawk has related to me about the
FADE TO BLACK: Black Lodge is true, even a man of Briggs' considerable
FADE TO BLACK: fortitude would be tested to his ultimate limits.
FADE TO BLACK: In an even darker corner of my thoughts is my old partner,
FADE TO BLACK: Windom Earle, the man who, prior to his utter mental
FADE TO BLACK: and emotional collapse, burned with a brilliance I doubt
FADE TO BLACK: I will ever see the equal of. Add to that the things I've
FADE TO BLACK: witnessed here at Twin Peaks: the tremendous evil forces
FADE TO BLACK: that linger on the periphery of this genuine, spirited little
FADE TO BLACK: town. The darkness Laura Palmer submitted to. The
FADE TO BLACK: #2.011 Revised 10-18-90, BLUE
FADE TO BLACK: 20. CONTINUED:
FADE TO BLACK: vortex that swallowed and consumed Leland Palmer ...
FADE TO BLACK: Diane, as a human being learns and matures, one's
FADE TO BLACK: experiences grow proportionately more rich and
FADE TO BLACK: mysterious. Perhaps the questions I now seek answers to
FADE TO BLACK: lie beyond the old perameters. Beyond my life at the
FADE TO BLACK: bureau.
FADE TO BLACK: The phone rings. He clicks off. Picks up.
FADE TO BLACK: Cooper ... yes, Denise ... I'll be right down.
FADE TO BLACK: He hangs up, stands to put his coat on, clicks on the recorder one more time.
FADE TO BLACK: Diane, when I've got a bit more time, remind me to tell
FADE TO BLACK: you about Agent Bryson ...
FADE TO BLACK: 21. INT. GREAT NORTHERN BAR WEDDING RECEPTION - NIGHT
FADE TO BLACK: A mix of local townspeople and Dougie's friends. Cooper works his way through to find
FADE TO BLACK: Dennis/Denise waiting at the bar.
FADE TO BLACK: Bad news first. I found cocaine residue in your car. My
FADE TO BLACK: guess is it's going to be a match to lot stolen from the
FADE TO BLACK: Mountie.
FADE TO BLACK: Dennis, this can't look straight to you.
FADE TO BLACK: Denise.
FADE TO BLACK: Sorry.
FADE TO BLACK: Sure it looks like a frame, Coop. But I'm going to need
FADE TO BLACK: more than your opinion to make that stick.
FADE TO BLACK: Can you help me?
FADE TO BLACK: That gets into a delicate area. But on the other hand I'm
FADE TO BLACK: trying very hard lately to be more in touch with my
FADE TO BLACK: #2.011 Revised 10-23-90, PINK
FADE TO BLACK: 21. CONTINUED:
FADE TO BLACK: feelings ...
FADE TO BLACK: Could I have another daquiri please?
FADE TO BLACK: Dennis, if you don't mind my asking, what the hell
FADE TO BLACK: happened to you?
FADE TO BLACK: Not at all. It's good to talk about it. It's simple,
FADE TO BLACK: really. Last year I was working undercover on a suburban
FADE TO BLACK: surveillance, some Bolivians were moving coke out of a
FADE TO BLACK: house across the street ... the seller had a few kinks, his rep
FADE TO BLACK: was he'd only sell to transvestites. So my partner and I
FADE TO BLACK: shacked up. I played the buyer and I found that wearing
FADE TO BLACK: women's clothes ... relaxed me. I continued wearing them
FADE TO BLACK: into the night. My partner thought it was my consummate
FADE TO BLACK: professionalism. It was a very confusing two weeks.
FADE TO BLACK: To say the least.
FADE TO BLACK: So one thing led to another and I'm currently into a
FADE TO BLACK: specialized kind of program called Gender Relocation
FADE TO BLACK: Inhibition Therapy, or G.R.I.T. Part of my treatment is
FADE TO BLACK: to dress the part for six months prior to any further
FADE TO BLACK: therapy; hormones, electrolysis -
FADE TO BLACK: This is all a pretty astounding disclosure, Denise.
FADE TO BLACK: Imagine how surprised I was. This isn't something you
FADE TO BLACK: exactly plan on.
FADE TO BLACK: A happy commotion from the reception across the room.
FADE TO BLACK: 22. PETE MARTELL AND DWAYNE MILFORD
FADE TO BLACK: Seated a small table along the way, Pete and Dwayne sit over a couple drinks, watching
FADE TO BLACK: Dougie cuddle with his bride over the cutting of the wedding cake.
FADE TO BLACK: She started by taking one of Dougie's college classes.
FADE TO BLACK: Ethics in Modern Journalism. Two things I guarantee you
FADE TO BLACK: that little bird knows nothing about. Three weeks later

FADE TO BLACK: she's landed a job writing for the Gazette. Dougie's

FADE TO BLACK: We all kinda' live in that glass house, don't you think,
FADE TO BLACK: Dwayne?
FADE TO BLACK: I was married to the same woman for half a century, god
FADE TO BLACK: rest her soul. That's because I think with my brain, not
FADE TO BLACK: my garden hose -
FADE TO BLACK: Music turned out pretty good.
FADE TO BLACK: Oughta' be a death march.
FADE TO BLACK: Across the room, Lana holds the ceremonial bouquet before a host of eager women. She flings
FADE TO BLACK: it up into a looping flight, from where it's suddenly snatched by an agile Denise. There's some
FADE TO BLACK: surly mumbling amongst the other girls about the bouquet-snagging by this ringer. Denise
FADE TO BLACK: sashays back to the bar, where Truman has now joined Cooper.
FADE TO BLACK: Unfair advantage. How many of those girls were Varsity
FADE TO BLACK: wide receivers?
FADE TO BLACK: Hope those two go up to the honeymoon suite soon. We've
FADE TO BLACK: had to separate Dwayne and Dougie twice. Happens
FADE TO BLACK: every wedding. My theory is Dwayne's jealous.
FADE TO BLACK: The ensemble music kicks up again. Denise looks a little wistful. Lana and Dougie swing by
FADE TO BLACK: in greeting.
FADE TO BLACK: Sheriff, arrest this woman. She's too beautiful to be
FADE TO BLACK: living in this state.
FADE TO BLACK: Dougie, you say the sweetest things...

FADE TO BLACK: Cooper, who pivots slightly on his barstool, folding them into a semi-private exchange.
FADE TO BLACK: Excuse me. Didn't you ... rescue me once?
FADE TO BLACK: That's one version of the story.
FADE TO BLACK: One last dance?
FADE TO BLACK: Cooper accompanies her off to the dance floor. Denise sways slightly. It is now just he and
FADE TO BLACK: Truman. And Andy, hovering nearby.
FADE TO BLACK: I love this music.
FADE TO BLACK: God ... I feel a little awkward. I .. would you ...
FADE TO BLACK: Truman's eyes widen with understanding. It's a waltz. Not that it really matters what it is.
FADE TO BLACK: I'm not ... much of a dancer.
FADE TO BLACK: An awkward pause.
FADE TO BLACK: May I have this dance?
FADE TO BLACK: Thank you.
FADE TO BLACK: Denise takes Andy's arm, as they move over toward the floor.

FADE TO BLACK: Thanks. You move very smoothly, too.
FADE TO BLACK: Thanks.
FADE TO BLACK: Lana looks at him with bubbly respect. MOVE OFF to Cooper dancing with Audrey.
FADE TO BLACK: I heard you might be in trouble.
FADE TO BLACK: Trouble in this instance, Audrey, may be a door to a new
FADE TO BLACK: way of looking at the world.
FADE TO BLACK: I guess you could say that about everything you do.
FADE TO BLACK: That's my hope, Audrey and my aspiration.
FADE TO BLACK: Well, if you ever decide to come down off the mountain
FADE TO BLACK: top and mingle with us regular folks, I'd like to hear
FADE TO BLACK: some of your stories.
FADE TO BLACK: It's a deal. I hope they're interesting ones.
FADE TO BLACK: She smiles. He returns it. MOVE OFF them to Andy and Denise; Denise is an excellent

FADE TO BLACK: I won't waste your time. Your brother, my husband,
FADE TO BLACK: Andrew Packard ...
FADE TO BLACK: ... was killed by a man named Thomas Eckhardt.
FADE TO BLACK: Catherine's face retains its emotionless appearance.
FADE TO BLACK: Eight years ago, Andrew got the better of Eckhardt in a
FADE TO BLACK: business deal. Eckhardt never forgets a slight. He sets an
FADE TO BLACK: hour aside every day to think about how he will ruin his
FADE TO BLACK: enemies. In this case, I was his answer. He introduced
FADE TO BLACK: me to Andrew. I was to make Andrew fall in love with
FADE TO BLACK: me, marry him and eventually help Eckhardt kill him.
FADE TO BLACK: Josie pauses, awaiting Catherine's response. She looks back in quiet arrogance.
FADE TO BLACK: Dear, your slip is showing.
FADE TO BLACK: Excuse me?
FADE TO BLACK: Tell me something I don't already know.
FADE TO BLACK: A beat. Josie hides her dismay.
FADE TO BLACK: Eckhardt is the most evil man I've ever known. His
FADE TO BLACK: design was to ruin the Packard family, not just Andrew.
FADE TO BLACK: I've escaped him for the moment, but he'll come back for
FADE TO BLACK: me. And for you. That is why I'm here.
FADE TO BLACK: How endearing.
FADE TO BLACK: Catherine, you're in terrible danger.
FADE TO BLACK: You help kill my brother, try to cheat me out of my land,
FADE TO BLACK: my family's lifeblood, utterly destroy my existence and

FADE TO BLACK: How unfortunate ...

FADE TO BLACK: propose we do?
FADE TO BLACK: I don't know ...
FADE TO BLACK: Catherine's thoughtful moment. Josie watches her.
FADE TO BLACK: Then I'll tell you. From now on, you work for me. Here
FADE TO BLACK: at the house. As a maid. You'll move your things to the
FADE TO BLACK: servant's quarters. If you disobey me, if you lie to me, if
FADE TO BLACK: you contradict a single thing I tell you, I'll find this
FADE TO BLACK: Eckhardt myself and feed you to him by hand. Is that
FADE TO BLACK: clear?
FADE TO BLACK: Josie is shocked. Chastened.
