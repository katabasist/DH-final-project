SECOND DRAFT: 1. INT. SHERIFF TRUMAN'S OFFICE - MORNING
SECOND DRAFT: CLOSE ON the DEATH MASK laying on the desk. Next to it, the TAPE PLAYER is
SECOND DRAFT: broadcasting the VOICE of Windom Earle. PULL BACK to reveal COOPER sitting
SECOND DRAFT: opposite TRUMAN - both listening.
SECOND DRAFT: EARLE'S VOICE
SECOND DRAFT: Now, Dale. Listen carefully. It's your move. And please, put your heart
SECOND DRAFT: into it, will you? I've noticed a certain tentative quality in your thinking, as
SECOND DRAFT: if your mind were occupied with issues other than those on the board
SECOND DRAFT: before you. Such preoccupation not only weakens one's resolve, but one's
SECOND DRAFT: foresight as well. A deadly failing in any match, you must agree. But in
SECOND DRAFT: this particular contest, quite disasterous, as we play for grave stakes, the
SECOND DRAFT: likes of which you have no doubt surmised.
SECOND DRAFT: Print your move in tomorrow's paper. Or I will make it for you.
SECOND DRAFT: Cooper, I'm not letting you out of my sight.
SECOND DRAFT: If Windom wanted to kill me, I'd already be dead. Get
SECOND DRAFT: Pete on the phone.
SECOND DRAFT: Lucy, call Pete Martel, tell him to get over here, then call
SECOND DRAFT: the paper, find out the latest possible deadline for
SECOND DRAFT: tomorrow's personal column.
SECOND DRAFT: Truman turns off the intercom looking up at Cooper. But Cooper's staring at the mask...
SECOND DRAFT: She was beautiful.
SECOND DRAFT: She was the love of my life.
SECOND DRAFT: 2. INT. BLUE PINE LODGE - MORNING
SECOND DRAFT: ANDREW PACKARD and CATHERINE MARTELL sit at the kitchen table, sipping
SECOND DRAFT: coffee. In the background, Pete's in the kitchen on the phone.
SECOND DRAFT: Okay, Lucy, tell Harry I'm on my way.
SECOND DRAFT: He hangs up, and picks UP TWO PLATES of food, eagerly scurries in from the kitchen,
SECOND DRAFT: serving Catherine her breakfast first, then Andrew, who looks down and bursts out laughing.
SECOND DRAFT: #2.016
SECOND DRAFT: 2. CONTINUED:
SECOND DRAFT: On his plate are scrambled eggs with a smiley face made out of crumbled bacon. Toast
SECOND DRAFT: points make the ears.
SECOND DRAFT: Pete, salt and pepper?
SECOND DRAFT: Nobody knows, the trouble I've seen...
SECOND DRAFT: Eyes twinkling, slave to Catherine's every whim, Pete softly sings. Andrew laughs all over
SECOND DRAFT: again.
SECOND DRAFT: Please, God help me, please, confine your singing to the
SECOND DRAFT: shower. Salt and pepper...?
SECOND DRAFT: Okay, Poodle, comin' right up.
SECOND DRAFT: Pete goes into the kitchen, still laughing.
SECOND DRAFT: You two bring out the worst in each other.
SECOND DRAFT: Pete's a prince of a man.
SECOND DRAFT: A court jester, more likely.
SECOND DRAFT: Pete returns with the salt and pepper shakers, wearing his hat and coat.
SECOND DRAFT: I gotta mosey.
SECOND DRAFT: He and Andrew try to slap the other on the head, each ducking out of the way - their age-proof
SECOND DRAFT: goodbye, then Pete, in a burst of familial enthusiasm, kisses Catherine on the cheek.
SECOND DRAFT: Goodbye, sweet Packards!
SECOND DRAFT: He leaves. Catherine looks at Andrew, unable to hide her distaste.
SECOND DRAFT: Catherine, Catherine... I'd always halfway hoped that age
SECOND DRAFT: and time would mellow the tempest raging inside you.
SECOND DRAFT: #2.016 3.
SECOND DRAFT: 2. CONTINUED:
SECOND DRAFT: (pushes her breakfast away, takes a lemon out of
SECOND DRAFT: the fruit bowl, slices it)
SECOND DRAFT: Watching you two act like the Hardy Boys always brings
SECOND DRAFT: on stormy weather. What's happening with Ghostwood?
SECOND DRAFT: I spoke with our investors, the meeting's set. I fly to Paris
SECOND DRAFT: tomorrow.
SECOND DRAFT: Andrew... I've been thinking... about a shopping mall.
SECOND DRAFT: Near the industrial park?
SECOND DRAFT: No, right next to the Great Northern. Adjacent to the
SECOND DRAFT: new hotel I want to build.
SECOND DRAFT: I'm sure Ben will... appreciate the competition.
SECOND DRAFT: I think it's the least I can do, don't you?
SECOND DRAFT: Oh, good. Company.
SECOND DRAFT: The back door opens and JOSIE walks in carrying a bundle of kindling. She stops cold,
SECOND DRAFT: staring at Andrew - it can't be. She drops the wood, and moves closer, eyes wide with horror.
SECOND DRAFT: Dear Josie. I'm home. Did you miss me?
SECOND DRAFT: Josie PASSES OUT cold. Neither Andrew or Catherine move. Pause.
SECOND DRAFT: She seems surprised.
SECOND DRAFT: Poor thing. Couldn't even pull off a simple murder.
SECOND DRAFT: She has her charms, though.
SECOND DRAFT: True. But not for long.
SECOND DRAFT: #2.016 4.
SECOND DRAFT: 3. INT. SHERIFF'S TRUMAN'S OFFICE - DAY
SECOND DRAFT: Harry looks down at a SEATTLE NEWSPAPER featuring JONATHAN'S PHOTO and
SECOND DRAFT: the HEADLINE: "NO CLUES TO KILLER." Truman loathes his own suspicions. There's a
SECOND DRAFT: KNOCK on the door. HAWK opens the door wide, making enough room for himself and
SECOND DRAFT: HANK, who hobbles in, handcuffed to his crutches. Truman tenses, in no mood for this.
SECOND DRAFT: Hello, Harry.
SECOND DRAFT: Hank makes a mock attempt to shake hands - making a point. Truman gives him a long look.
SECOND DRAFT: Save it, Hank.
SECOND DRAFT: Jeez, did you get up on the wrong side of the bed this
SECOND DRAFT: morning? I broke parole! Cry me a river.
SECOND DRAFT: You crossed the border into Canada, we have photographs
SECOND DRAFT: of you consorting with felons at Dead Dog Farm and I'm
SECOND DRAFT: charging you with the attempted murder of Leo Johnson.
SECOND DRAFT: Ouch. Okay. Well. I think it's safe to assume that I was
SECOND DRAFT: at the diner the night Leo was plugged, but you're
SECOND DRAFT: welcome to -
SECOND DRAFT: I've got a witness puts you at the scene with a gun in your
SECOND DRAFT: hand. You are one cat that just used up his ninth life.
SECOND DRAFT: Harry, you obviously seem serious about this, so I'm
SECOND DRAFT: going to modestly propose a trade. How about
SECOND DRAFT: information leading to the arrest and conviction of
SECOND DRAFT: Andrew Packard's murderer. Hank Jennings, witness for
SECOND DRAFT: the prosecution.
SECOND DRAFT: No deals.
SECOND DRAFT: You're going to tell me you care more about the
SECOND DRAFT: attempted murder of Leo Johnson, felon, than you do
SECOND DRAFT: about Andrew Packard? How's that gonna go over with
SECOND DRAFT: your constituents -
SECOND DRAFT: #2.016 5.
SECOND DRAFT: 3. CONTINUED:
SECOND DRAFT: You're through in my town, Hank.
SECOND DRAFT: My guess is, Harry, not too well, especially once people
SECOND DRAFT: find out who pushed the button on Andrew and that you've
SECOND DRAFT: been sleeping with her -
SECOND DRAFT: Truman goes white with rage. Pause. Hawk kicks out one of Hank's crutches, he goes down.
SECOND DRAFT: Gee, I sorry.
SECOND DRAFT: Hank's on the floor, gasping with pain.
SECOND DRAFT: Get him out of my sight.
SECOND DRAFT: Hawk hurries to remove Hank. Truman collapses in his chair: it can't be true.
SECOND DRAFT: 4. INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - MORNING
SECOND DRAFT: CLOSE on the table: MORGUE PHOTOS and VICUNA COAT SAMPLES on the table.
SECOND DRAFT: ALBERT ROSENFIELD pulls out two plastic envelopes, both contain a single bullet.
SECOND DRAFT: This is the bullet we removed from you ...
SECOND DRAFT: ... this one was excavated from the dead man's skull.
SECOND DRAFT: He indicates a MORGUE PHOTO of the back of JONATHAN'S HEAD.
SECOND DRAFT: Same bullets, same gun, same killer. Let's go get her.
SECOND DRAFT: Albert, hold your horses.
SECOND DRAFT: Coop, I appreciate any reluctance you might have for
SECOND DRAFT: busting your pal's old lady, but the woman ventilated you
SECOND DRAFT: and left you for dead -
SECOND DRAFT: I don't take it personally. What about the gloves, powder
SECOND DRAFT: tests?
SECOND DRAFT: #2.016 6.
SECOND DRAFT: 4. CONTINUED:
SECOND DRAFT: News at five.
SECOND DRAFT: Fine, maybe you're not mad, but there's an epidemic of
SECOND DRAFT: multiple gunshot wounds following this chick around.
SECOND DRAFT: She's a menace.
SECOND DRAFT: Pause. Cooper moves to the door.
SECOND DRAFT: I'll talk to her. Maybe she'll confess, turn herself in.
SECOND DRAFT: Maybe she'll grow wings and join the circus.
SECOND DRAFT: 5. INT. GREAT NORTHERN HOTEL - DAY
SECOND DRAFT: AUDREY, dressed for success, walks across the lobby carrying a stack of manila file folders
SECOND DRAFT: to the Concierge Desk, where the concierge, EMILE LAZARE, officiates.
SECOND DRAFT: Emile, I've got a list of all our "non-repeat" guests. We're
SECOND DRAFT: going to send them a special invitation from the Great
SECOND DRAFT: Northern.
SECOND DRAFT: Emile shoves an AUDREY name tag toward her as she sits down. He smiles thinly,
SECOND DRAFT: supercillious:
SECOND DRAFT: Your enthusiasm brings a salty tear to the eye. However, I
SECOND DRAFT: think you will find my job requires more than tight
SECOND DRAFT: sweaters and a perky attitude.
SECOND DRAFT: Emile, I'm learning the business, every week a different
SECOND DRAFT: department. I don't want your job.
SECOND DRAFT: I look forward to your stint in housekeeping.
SECOND DRAFT: This came for you this morning. Good luck, Miss Horne.
SECOND DRAFT: You'll need it.
SECOND DRAFT: Emile turns his back and walks away. Audrey glares after, hurt, angry. She rips open the
SECOND DRAFT: envelope. A voice intrudes:
SECOND DRAFT: WHEELER'S VOICE
SECOND DRAFT: Excuse me, I just checked in to room 215...?
SECOND DRAFT: #2.016 Revised 12-19-90, BLUE
SECOND DRAFT: 5. CONTINUED:
SECOND DRAFT: Congratulations.
SECOND DRAFT: WHEELER'S VOICE
SECOND DRAFT: ... They told me at the front desk I should talk to -
SECOND DRAFT: WHAT can I do for you?!?
SECOND DRAFT: Audrey finally looks up, right into the smoldering eyes of JOHN JUSTICE WHEELER -
SECOND DRAFT: full on knock-down-drag-out handsome. Wheeler meets her glare with a friendly smile.
SECOND DRAFT: Simple, uncomplicated.
SECOND DRAFT: Sorry. I thought you were working.
SECOND DRAFT: I am working. See?
SECOND DRAFT: Audrey slaps her hands through the papers and files atop the concierge desk. Tantrum
SECOND DRAFT: exorcised, she looks back to the handsome stranger, manages a more business-like mien.
SECOND DRAFT: Audrey ... Horne?
SECOND DRAFT: At your service.
SECOND DRAFT: Good. I need a fax machine installed in my room as soon
SECOND DRAFT: as possible.
SECOND DRAFT: (grabbing paper, pen; she wants to get this over
SECOND DRAFT: with)
SECOND DRAFT: I can handle that.
SECOND DRAFT: And I'm wondering if you could send somebody out to
SECOND DRAFT: the airport. I'm carrying some heavy equipment on this
SECOND DRAFT: trip that they didn't have room for on the van.
SECOND DRAFT: What flight were you on?
SECOND DRAFT: #2.016 8.
SECOND DRAFT: 5. CONTINUED:
SECOND DRAFT: My own. It's the only jet out there. Shouldn't be too hard
SECOND DRAFT: to find.
SECOND DRAFT: Audrey looks at him - blue jeans, t-shirt, cowboy boots - a jet!? She deadpans:
SECOND DRAFT: Is there anything else I can do for you, Mr. Rockefeller?
SECOND DRAFT: No. That's all for now. Thanks.
SECOND DRAFT: Wheeler steps away. Audrey takes a closer look. Wheeler pivots, smiles.
SECOND DRAFT: I have a picture of you. Little dirndl skirt, white apron,
SECOND DRAFT: long braids. Unbelievably cute.
SECOND DRAFT: I don't wear dirndl.
SECOND DRAFT: You did then. Right here in the Great Northern dining
SECOND DRAFT: room. If I close my eyes I can almost see it. Audrey
SECOND DRAFT: Horne as "Heidi". Unforgettable.
SECOND DRAFT: "Heidi"?
SECOND DRAFT: I was ten. How did you...? Hey!
SECOND DRAFT: Too late. Wheeler's gone. Audrey watches him step through the lobby, anger now leavened
SECOND DRAFT: with curiosity. A beat. She looks down at the envelope. Pulls out a vertically torn piece of
SECOND DRAFT: paper, reading part of a POEM:
SECOND DRAFT: I have dreamed
SECOND DRAFT: walked so much
SECOND DRAFT: I have to do now
SECOND DRAFT: Phantoms and a ghost
SECOND DRAFT: Ghost who walks
SECOND DRAFT: Of
SECOND DRAFT: With it, a separate INVITATION: Save the One you Love. Please attend gathering of Angels
SECOND DRAFT: tonight at the Roadhouse, 9:30. Audrey looks up, sees Wheeler get into the elevator.
SECOND DRAFT: FADE OUT.
SECOND DRAFT: #2.016 9.
SECOND DRAFT: 6. INT. HURLEY HOUSE - DAY
SECOND DRAFT: ED is reading the newspaper when NADINE bursts in the front door.
SECOND DRAFT: Nadine, what are you doing home from school?
SECOND DRAFT: Are you feeling poorly?
SECOND DRAFT: Eddie, we have to talk.
SECOND DRAFT: Okay.
SECOND DRAFT: They sit on the sofa. Long pause.
SECOND DRAFT: I just feel like... more and more... like we're... you
SECOND DRAFT: know.... Kind of... well... growing apart?
SECOND DRAFT: I've noticed that too.
SECOND DRAFT: Oh Eddie, I better tell you before you hear it from the
SECOND DRAFT: kids at school. Mike and I are in love.
SECOND DRAFT: In love.
SECOND DRAFT: #2.016 10.
SECOND DRAFT: 6. CONTINUED:
SECOND DRAFT: I hope you're not hurt, I wouldn't want to hurt you for
SECOND DRAFT: anything in the world, honest, you have to believe that. But
SECOND DRAFT: Mike and I... on the wrestling trip, we had the most
SECOND DRAFT: magical night together.
SECOND DRAFT: All night?
SECOND DRAFT: Well, you and Norma did it!
SECOND DRAFT: That's fair. So Nadine, what does this mean?
SECOND DRAFT: Eddie, we have to call a spade a spade. We're breaking
SECOND DRAFT: up. And as soon as my parents come home, it'd probably
SECOND DRAFT: be best if you moved back in with your folks. Eddie... I
SECOND DRAFT: am so sorry.
SECOND DRAFT: Ed nods. He's not, but he's straining not to show it.
SECOND DRAFT: 7. INT. BLUE PINE LODGE - DAY
SECOND DRAFT: Josie and Cooper sit on the couch. Josie's fidgets nervously, won't look Cooper in the eye.
SECOND DRAFT: Josie, this is your last chance to level with me about what
SECOND DRAFT: happened in Seattle.
SECOND DRAFT: I told you, how many times do I have to say it, I escaped
SECOND DRAFT: from Jonathan at the airport. After that, I don't know
SECOND DRAFT: what happened to him.
SECOND DRAFT: Do you understand that I could arrest you right now?
SECOND DRAFT: Josie cowers.
SECOND DRAFT: 8. INT. BLUE PINE KITCHEN
SECOND DRAFT: Catherine is glued to the door, listening to every word. Delighted.
SECOND DRAFT: #2.016 11.
SECOND DRAFT: 9. INT. BLUE PINE LIVING ROOM
SECOND DRAFT: I'm here as a friend... of Harry's. I don't know what place
SECOND DRAFT: he occupies in your heart, but I know you own his.
SECOND DRAFT: Wouldn't you want a chance to try and explain this to him
SECOND DRAFT: before -
SECOND DRAFT: Please go.
SECOND DRAFT: Josie looks away. Cooper stands.
SECOND DRAFT: There's nowhere for you to run.
SECOND DRAFT: I'll give you until six. If you're not at the station house by
SECOND DRAFT: then, I'll come back for you.
SECOND DRAFT: He leaves. Josie doesn't move, the noose tightens.
SECOND DRAFT: Catherine pretends to have just come in the back door. She sashays through the living room.
SECOND DRAFT: Josie! I just saw Agent Cooper leave, was this a social
SECOND DRAFT: call?
SECOND DRAFT: Josie doesn't respond, staring into space.
SECOND DRAFT: Dear, you look awful. Is everything all right?
SECOND DRAFT: I don't feel well.
SECOND DRAFT: I'm sorry. Well, I wish I had better news. I've spoken to
SECOND DRAFT: Mr. Eckhardt again, on your behalf. He's not entirely
SECOND DRAFT: unsympathetic, but he does insist on seeing you alone.
SECOND DRAFT: Tonight.
SECOND DRAFT: He'll kill me.
SECOND DRAFT: #2.016 12.
SECOND DRAFT: 9. CONTINUED:
SECOND DRAFT: To tell you the truth, my biggest worry is what he'll do if
SECOND DRAFT: he finds out that Andrew is alive. Won't Mr. Eckhardt
SECOND DRAFT: think you betrayed him?
SECOND DRAFT: But of course you can always plead ignorance; after all,
SECOND DRAFT: you did think Andrew was dead.
SECOND DRAFT: Josie holds her head, truly being driven crazy.
SECOND DRAFT: Catherine, please. Help me. I don't know what to do. I
SECOND DRAFT: feel like I'm going mad...
SECOND DRAFT: Josie, you're going to have to face Mr. Eckhardt sooner or
SECOND DRAFT: later. Tell him the truth. Tell him anything you desire.
SECOND DRAFT: Just pray he'll believe it. Now where did I leave my
SECOND DRAFT: keys....?
SECOND DRAFT: Catherine rustles through a draw desk drawer, reveals a HANDGUN. She grabs her keys, steps
SECOND DRAFT: away. Josie pauses, stricken, eyes locked on the weapon. A beat. And she reaches for it.
SECOND DRAFT: Catherine stops to glance back at Josie from across the room. She smiles.
SECOND DRAFT: 10. INT. GREAT NORTHERN HOTEL - DAY
SECOND DRAFT: THOMAS ECKHARDT, hands his assistant, JONES, a stack of CASH. Her suitcase is
SECOND DRAFT: open on the bed.
SECOND DRAFT: The entire amount.
SECOND DRAFT: I trust you'll finish the job, regardless of what happens
SECOND DRAFT: tonight.
SECOND DRAFT: Surely you of all people know what happens when my trust
SECOND DRAFT: is violated.
SECOND DRAFT: He pulls a GAROTTE out of her bracelet, wraps it around her wrists. Kisses her.
SECOND DRAFT: Check out. Drive north, for a day. I'll wrap up my affairs
SECOND DRAFT: and be gone by morning. Come back tomorrow night and
SECOND DRAFT: finish up.
SECOND DRAFT: Yes sir.
SECOND DRAFT: #2.016 Revised 12-19-90, BLUE
SECOND DRAFT: 11. INT. BEN HORNE'S OFFICE - DAY
SECOND DRAFT: Order has been restored. Around the conference table are the GREAT NORTHERN
BOARD MEMBERS: BEN, Audrey, and JERRY, who is making black olive paste canapes.
BOARD MEMBERS: BOBBY BRIGGS stands next to Ben's desk, hanging up a phone.
BOARD MEMBERS: No answer, Ben. He must be on his way.
BOARD MEMBERS: Thank you, lad. Join us, will you? Board Meetings are
BOARD MEMBERS: usually nothing more than a gathering of self-minded
BOARD MEMBERS: individuals more intent than the next on financial
BOARD MEMBERS: gain. But today, well, today will be something
BOARD MEMBERS: completely different.
BOARD MEMBERS: Bobby hurries to his seat. Audrey smiles at the new eager beaver, as the door opens behind her.
BOARD MEMBERS: Ahh. Here he is now. Jack, you're a sight for sore eyes.
BOARD MEMBERS: Are we taking good care of you?
BOARD MEMBERS: Audrey reacts, stunned to see the man with the jet, now dressed in a beautiful Armani suit.
BOARD MEMBERS: Ben embraces Wheeler like a long-lost son. Wheeler smiles at Audrey.
BOARD MEMBERS: My luggage just arrived. Thank you, Audrey.
BOARD MEMBERS: You two have met?
BOARD MEMBERS: Briefly.
BOARD MEMBERS: John Justice Wheeler. Used to work construction, came up
BOARD MEMBERS: the hard way.
BOARD MEMBERS: How nice for him.
BOARD MEMBERS: #2.016 Revised 12-19-90, BLUE
BOARD MEMBERS: 11. CONTINUED:
BOARD MEMBERS: Jack, take a seat, you know brother Jerry, of course, and
BOARD MEMBERS: this is my executive assistant, young Bob Briggs.
BOARD MEMBERS: Wheeler sits down between Bobby and Audrey. Audrey takes a wary look at the stranger. He
BOARD MEMBERS: returns a smile. Jerry passes his canapes around. And Ben clears his throat, begins:
BOARD MEMBERS: I've asked Mr. Wheeler to our board. Years ago, I
BOARD MEMBERS: invested in him, a pittance he built into an empire. I take
BOARD MEMBERS: no credit. But I believed in Jack, even when he was just
BOARD MEMBERS: another local boy pounding nails. I have asked him to
BOARD MEMBERS: return the favor by believing, in me now.
BOARD MEMBERS: Wheeler nods assent. Ben pauses with requisite drama, at least long enough for Jerry to finish
BOARD MEMBERS: chomping on a rather hefty canape... and begins:
BOARD MEMBERS: Horne Industries Incorporated have fallen on hard times.
BOARD MEMBERS: The mill and Ghostwood lands are now solely owned by
BOARD MEMBERS: Catherine Martell. We don't begrudge her the mill, it was
BOARD MEMBERS: and is, after all, hers. But we sweated blood to make
BOARD MEMBERS: Ghostwood ours for a doggone decade. Retail revenues at
BOARD MEMBERS: the department store are down fourteen percent. And as
BOARD MEMBERS: for the hotel, well, let's just say it's off-season and leave it
BOARD MEMBERS: at that.
BOARD MEMBERS: Ben, over in Sicily, I had a marketing brainstorm. We set
BOARD MEMBERS: up a special package deal: Twin Peaks, Land of Crime.
BOARD MEMBERS: See where Laura Palmer was murdered, see where her
BOARD MEMBERS: body was found, visit Maddy Ferguson's final resting
BOARD MEMBERS: place; I call it the Homicide Getaway -
BOARD MEMBERS: #2.016 Revised 12-19-90, BLUE
BOARD MEMBERS: 11. CONTINUED:
BOARD MEMBERS: Everyone looks at Jerry like he's lost his mind.
BOARD MEMBERS: Thank you, Jer. We'll put it on the agenda for further
BOARD MEMBERS: review.
BOARD MEMBERS: But in spite of these reversals, stripped of the trappings of
BOARD MEMBERS: success, what are we left with? The human spirit. I've been
BOARD MEMBERS: taking a good hard look at my own soul, and I've decided
BOARD MEMBERS: it's high time Ben Horne gave something back to society.
BOARD MEMBERS: Ben, not the hotel.
BOARD MEMBERS: No. Not the hotel. What's the greatest gift one human
BOARD MEMBERS: being can give to another? The future.
BOARD MEMBERS: He goes over to a DRAPED EASEL in the corner, and removes the cloth, revealing a large
BOARD MEMBERS: Audobon-style drawing of a WEASEL.
BOARD MEMBERS: I give you... the pine weasel - found only in our tri-county
BOARD MEMBERS: area. Targeted by the Environmental Defense League and
BOARD MEMBERS: the Wilderness Society. Nearly extinct.
BOARD MEMBERS: They're incredible roasted. A ginger and garlic
BOARD MEMBERS: marinade, a glass of sauvignon blanc -
BOARD MEMBERS: According to an environmental impact report I
BOARD MEMBERS: commissioned, what few pine weasels remain...
BOARD MEMBERS: ... will be all but wiped out by the Packard plans for
BOARD MEMBERS: Ghostwood development.
BOARD MEMBERS: #2.016 Revised 12-19-90, BLUE
BOARD MEMBERS: 11. CONTINUED:
BOARD MEMBERS: You wanna "save the pine weasel"?
BOARD MEMBERS: Not just the pine weasel. Life as we know it. I want
BOARD MEMBERS: Twin Peaks to remain unspoiled in an era of vast
BOARD MEMBERS: environmental carnage.
BOARD MEMBERS: But development is progress: people, money.
BOARD MEMBERS: Not always. Ben if I could interrupt -
BOARD MEMBERS: Please, Jack.
BOARD MEMBERS: What Ben's talking about is quality of life, something we
BOARD MEMBERS: don't consider much in the business world. It's my
BOARD MEMBERS: experience that a corporation like Horne Industries is not
BOARD MEMBERS: just a vehicle for making money, but for expressing values
BOARD MEMBERS: too.
BOARD MEMBERS: Audrey looks at Wheeler, irked by the interruption, interested too.
BOARD MEMBERS: So we block Catherine's development until the wheel turns
BOARD MEMBERS: and we get another shot. Brilliant Ben, brilliant.
BOARD MEMBERS: I intend to fight the Ghostwood development on every
BOARD MEMBERS: ground with every available weapon. This little weasel is
BOARD MEMBERS: about to become a household word.
BOARD MEMBERS: Then what?
BOARD MEMBERS: Ben leans back, taking them all in.
BOARD MEMBERS: I'm considering a run for the Senate.
BOARD MEMBERS: #2.016
BOARD MEMBERS: 12. INT. DOUBLE R DINER - DAY
BOARD MEMBERS: SHELLY clears tables. ONE MAN sits at the counter finishing up. We MOVE IN to see
BOARD MEMBERS: that it's WINDOM EARLE, dressed like a TRUCK DRIVER: baseball hat, flannel shirt,
BOARD MEMBERS: jacket, and dirty jeans. He leaves some money on the counter - and an ENVELOPE.
BOARD MEMBERS: Talking on the phone. In the background, we see Windom Earle leave.
BOARD MEMBERS: ...Annie, it's no problem, really. I've got plenty of room.
BOARD MEMBERS: You get on the next bus and I'll be waiting.
BOARD MEMBERS: Okay, honey, don't cry. Things will be fine. I'll see you
BOARD MEMBERS: soon. I love you too. Bye.
BOARD MEMBERS: She hangs up. Shelly brings a load of dirty dishes over.
BOARD MEMBERS: So is she coming?
BOARD MEMBERS: Tomorrow.
BOARD MEMBERS: God, what do you have to do to get out of a convent?
BOARD MEMBERS: Leave. It's not a prison.
BOARD MEMBERS: Sure sounds like it to me.
BOARD MEMBERS: No TV. No boyfriends.
BOARD MEMBERS: When she was little I always thought Annie was from
BOARD MEMBERS: another time and place. The convent was right for her, in a
BOARD MEMBERS: way. It's kind of hard to imagine her out in the world.
BOARD MEMBERS: Here's something for you.
BOARD MEMBERS: Who from?
BOARD MEMBERS: #2.016
BOARD MEMBERS: 12. CONTINUED:
BOARD MEMBERS: I don't know. Whoever was sitting here.
BOARD MEMBERS: Shelly opens it, removes a piece of paper, both sides ripped - clearly a companion piece to the
BOARD MEMBERS: one Audrey received.
BOARD MEMBERS: Wow, get a load of this
BOARD MEMBERS: So much
BOARD MEMBERS: spoken
BOARD MEMBERS: perhaps it is to be
BOARD MEMBERS: a hundred times
BOARD MEMBERS: and will walk gaily over your
BOARD MEMBERS: This makes no sense.
BOARD MEMBERS: Save the one you love. A gathering of angels tonight at the
BOARD MEMBERS: Roadhouse, nine-thirty.
BOARD MEMBERS: Sounds romantic. Or dangerous.
BOARD MEMBERS: Sounds crazy. What could this be?
BOARD MEMBERS: The door flies open and BIG ED strides in - a man on a mission. Norma's face lights up. Ed
BOARD MEMBERS: doesn't speak, he takes Norma's hand and leads her out from behind the counter and into his
BOARD MEMBERS: arms. Shelly watches, wide-eyed.
BOARD MEMBERS: Norma, I've loved you every day for the past twenty years
BOARD MEMBERS: and I've dreamed of you every night. It's time for us to be
BOARD MEMBERS: together. Will you marry me?
BOARD MEMBERS: Norma's completely overcome.
BOARD MEMBERS: Ed...
BOARD MEMBERS: #2.016
BOARD MEMBERS: 12. CONTINUED:
BOARD MEMBERS: It 's finally our turn, baby. We deserve to be happy.
BOARD MEMBERS: Ed kisses her, full of love and passion.
BOARD MEMBERS: She smiles brightly. Dreams do come true.
BOARD MEMBERS: #2.016 20.
BOARD MEMBERS: 13. EXT. WOODS - DAY
BOARD MEMBERS: LEO sits on a tree stump, whittling a long, thin piece of wood, the SHOCK COLLAR around
BOARD MEMBERS: Leo's neck. WINDOM EARLE walks over, pats him on the back, like a dog.
BOARD MEMBERS: Good job, fella.
BOARD MEMBERS: Leo doesn't react, just keeps whittling.
BOARD MEMBERS: Just a few more, then we'll eat.
BOARD MEMBERS: Earle picks up one of the shafts, sings a snatch of an Irish drinking song, then ...
BOARD MEMBERS: "Fly to my breast, pierce me in colors autumnal/Speak to
BOARD MEMBERS: me only of love."
BOARD MEMBERS: Leo looks at him uncomprehendingly. Earle looks back.
BOARD MEMBERS: Leo, you have an incomplete education.
BOARD MEMBERS: For instance, survival in the wilderness a relevant issue
BOARD MEMBERS: in your life, my friend. This comes under the heading of
BOARD MEMBERS: practical instruction. I hope you've been paying attention.
BOARD MEMBERS: From his pocket, he takes a DEADLY ARROWHEAD, knifepoint gleaming, and affixes it to
BOARD MEMBERS: the shaft: an arrow. Leo gets the idea, smiles.
BOARD MEMBERS: Nature is cruel. This is also ... a lesson.
BOARD MEMBERS: 14. INT. SHERIFF'S STATION - DAY
BOARD MEMBERS: The JAIL. Hank's in his cell, laying down on the bed. The door opens, Norma enters.
BOARD MEMBERS: Hi, honey.
BOARD MEMBERS: Norma doesn't respond, looking at her husband through the bars.
BOARD MEMBERS: How do you feel?
BOARD MEMBERS: Great, now that you're here.
BOARD MEMBERS: #2.016
BOARD MEMBERS: 14. CONTINUED:
BOARD MEMBERS: He reaches through the bars to hold her hand. Norma doesn't move.
BOARD MEMBERS: Hank, I came here to ask for a divorce.
BOARD MEMBERS: First let me say I don't blame you. You gave me a second
BOARD MEMBERS: chance. I blew it. I don't know why I'm so self-
BOARD MEMBERS: destructive, but I can see now that's got to be my priority
BOARD MEMBERS: in getting well. I've got a lot of work to do. In fact, I
BOARD MEMBERS: decided I'm going to try to go into therapy - I don't
BOARD MEMBERS: want to be like this anymore.
BOARD MEMBERS: Hank closes his eyes, as though fighting back tears.
BOARD MEMBERS: Hank, that's... interesting. But I have to go on with my
BOARD MEMBERS: life.
BOARD MEMBERS: I know. I know you do. And I want you be be happy.
BOARD MEMBERS: Thank you.
BOARD MEMBERS: I want to ask you one last favor. I want you to help me get
BOARD MEMBERS: out of here. If they send me back to prison I'll die. Just
BOARD MEMBERS: tell the Sheriff I was at the restaurant the night Leo was
BOARD MEMBERS: shot. I was on my way there, but I can't prove it. You can.
BOARD MEMBERS: No more lies, Hank.
BOARD MEMBERS: It's not telling a lie. It's saving my life.
BOARD MEMBERS: No.
BOARD MEMBERS: Norma, you're killing me -
BOARD MEMBERS: #2.016 22.
BOARD MEMBERS: 14. CONTINUED:
BOARD MEMBERS: Don't blame me for this. Don't you dare.
BOARD MEMBERS: Pause. Anther track.
BOARD MEMBERS: Is it Big Ed, Norma? Is that what you're running to?
BOARD MEMBERS: Then here's the deal: give me my alibi, I'll give you your
BOARD MEMBERS: divorce.
BOARD MEMBERS: I didn't come here to negotiate. I came to say goodbye.
BOARD MEMBERS: She starts out.
BOARD MEMBERS: Fine, go ahead -
BOARD MEMBERS: You're his whore Norma!
BOARD MEMBERS: I'd rather be his whore, than your wife.
BOARD MEMBERS: She exits.
BOARD MEMBERS: Norma!!!
BOARD MEMBERS: 15. INT. SHERIFF'S STATION CONFERENCE ROOM DAY
BOARD MEMBERS: Pete, Cooper, and Truman are seated at the table - a CHESS BOARD lies in the middle.
BOARD MEMBERS: There's four or five ways to do this. They each have their
BOARD MEMBERS: virtues. I recall Casablanca and Lasker in St. Petersburg,
BOARD MEMBERS: 1914 -
BOARD MEMBERS: Pete, we've only got five minutes.
BOARD MEMBERS: Lucy, get the Examiner on the phone. Tell them not to
BOARD MEMBERS: close out the personals, we need a little more time.
BOARD MEMBERS: All eyes are on Pete - still staring at the board. Finally, he moves a pawn.
BOARD MEMBERS: #2.016 23.
BOARD MEMBERS: 15. CONTINUED:
BOARD MEMBERS: Okay, that's it. Guaranteed to cause some sleepless nights.
BOARD MEMBERS: As long as he can't take a piece off the board -
BOARD MEMBERS: He can't, at least not for five or six more moves.
BOARD MEMBERS: Maybe it'll just frustrate him, maybe he'll kill anyway.
BOARD MEMBERS: I don't think so Earle has a sense of honor about these
BOARD MEMBERS: things, however perverse.
BOARD MEMBERS: I never heard of a man who murdered by the rules.
BOARD MEMBERS: Albert sticks his head in the door - motioning for Cooper.
BOARD MEMBERS: Excuse me.
BOARD MEMBERS: Truman watches Cooper leave - with mounting dread. His call goes through.
BOARD MEMBERS: Sandy, this is Sheriff Truman, we've got our item ready -
BOARD MEMBERS: 15A. INT. SHERIFF'S STATION HALLWAY - DAY
BOARD MEMBERS: Albert leads Cooper all the way down to the other end of the hall - then faces him.
BOARD MEMBERS: I've got a match on the gun that whacked you to powder
BOARD MEMBERS: residue on Josie Packard's gloves. Seattle police have also
BOARD MEMBERS: come up with an eyewitness who positively id'd Josie
BOARD MEMBERS: leaving the car where they found the stiff. Now if you're
BOARD MEMBERS: not gonna bust the bitch, I'll consider it a personal
BOARD MEMBERS: privilege -
BOARD MEMBERS: Albert, I'll handle it.
BOARD MEMBERS: #2.016 24.
BOARD MEMBERS: 15. CONTINUED:
BOARD MEMBERS: Cooper looks down the hall, and Harry is standing there watching them. Cooper, full of pain
BOARD MEMBERS: and compassion, locks eyes with his friend. In that instant Harry knows the truth. He bolts out
BOARD MEMBERS: the front door.
BOARD MEMBERS: Looks like you just did.
BOARD MEMBERS: 16. INT. BLUE PINE LODGE - LATE AFTERNOON
BOARD MEMBERS: JOSIE'S ROOM. She sits at the vanity, in her slip, staring into the mirror - a doomed
BOARD MEMBERS: woman. She picks up a lipstick, and slowly applies it on her mouth. There's a KNOCK on
BOARD MEMBERS: her door.
BOARD MEMBERS: Come in.
BOARD MEMBERS: Andrew enters, carrying, TWO GLASSES of CHAMPAGNE.
BOARD MEMBERS: I assume you still have a taste for bubbly. We killed
BOARD MEMBERS: enough bottles in our time.
BOARD MEMBERS: Josie takes it, confused by his kindness. He raises his glass.
BOARD MEMBERS: To beginnings ... and endings. And the wisdom to know
BOARD MEMBERS: the difference.
BOARD MEMBERS: Andrew, I'm ... sorry.
BOARD MEMBERS: At first I hated you for it. Perfectly normal response. As
BOARD MEMBERS: my anger subsided I recalled that Eckhardt has a way of
BOARD MEMBERS: pursuading people to do ... anything. I assume it was his idea.
BOARD MEMBERS: He said that you never loved me, that you just married
BOARD MEMBERS: me to get back at him.
BOARD MEMBERS: That's not true. I did love you very much. But of course,
BOARD MEMBERS: I'm afraid the same could never be said for you.
BOARD MEMBERS: #2.016 25.
BOARD MEMBERS: 16. CONTINUED:
BOARD MEMBERS: Please, Josie, there's no need for lies between us.
BOARD MEMBERS: Josie hangs her head, ashamed.
BOARD MEMBERS: You had a job to do and you did it. That was your choice.
BOARD MEMBERS: Now you're paying the price. Every action has it's
BOARD MEMBERS: consequences, my dear.
BOARD MEMBERS: Josie looks at him, questioning.
BOARD MEMBERS: The police are closing in. If you don't take action, you'll
BOARD MEMBERS: be sleeping in a jail cell tonight.
BOARD MEMBERS: What can I do?... help me.
BOARD MEMBERS: You must see Eckhardt. Perhaps you were meant to be
BOARD MEMBERS: together all along. I truly believe that he loves you. He
BOARD MEMBERS: doesn't know I'm alive. And he can get you out of the
BOARD MEMBERS: country. Go to him, Josie. Now.
BOARD MEMBERS: Josie nods her head, downs the rest of her champagne, literally shaking with fright. She starts
BOARD MEMBERS: to speak again.
BOARD MEMBERS: Don't say anything. Let me just remember you this way.
BOARD MEMBERS: We won't speak again.
BOARD MEMBERS: He rises, looks at Josie one last time - so beautiful, so pathetic. Then he leaves.
BOARD MEMBERS: 17. EXT. MOUNTAIN - LATE AFTERNOON
BOARD MEMBERS: Nature at it's best. DONNA sits on a quilt next to a basket of wine, cheese, and crackers. We
BOARD MEMBERS: hear a motorcycle - it's JAMES. He dismounts, sits beside her. Both a little awkward.
BOARD MEMBERS: It's beautiful.
BOARD MEMBERS: I wanted to go somewhere we'd never been before. How'd
BOARD MEMBERS: it go with the police?
BOARD MEMBERS: They asked a million questions I didn't know the answer
BOARD MEMBERS: to. But the ones I did must've been enough. Evelyn's gonna
BOARD MEMBERS: #2.016 26.
BOARD MEMBERS: 17. CONTINUED:
BOARD MEMBERS: stand trial. I'll be a witness.
BOARD MEMBERS: You're still wearing the ring.
BOARD MEMBERS: Donna looks at the ring James gave her.
BOARD MEMBERS: I know about you and Evelyn.
BOARD MEMBERS: I don't blame you for hating me...
BOARD MEMBERS: Listen to me. I know what you were feeling, because I was
BOARD MEMBERS: feeling it too. And I believe Evelyn took advantage of
BOARD MEMBERS: that.
BOARD MEMBERS: It was wrong. I should have known it was.
BOARD MEMBERS: James. You can feel bad about what happened for you. But
BOARD MEMBERS: I don't want you to feel bad for me.
BOARD MEMBERS: I love you.
BOARD MEMBERS: They come together in a healing embrace, remain in each other's arms throughout. A long beat,
BOARD MEMBERS: then, quiet and sad:
BOARD MEMBERS: I remember when I thought love was simple. But look at
BOARD MEMBERS: us. Nothing we do seems to matter. Maybe love isn't
BOARD MEMBERS: enough.
BOARD MEMBERS: If we could just start over...
BOARD MEMBERS: Come home with me.
BOARD MEMBERS: I can't. Not right now.
BOARD MEMBERS: Donna pauses. She's knows what's best for James. No matter how much it hurts. That's why
BOARD MEMBERS: she brought him here.
BOARD MEMBERS: #2.016 27.
BOARD MEMBERS: 17. CONTINUED:
BOARD MEMBERS: Then go. Ride as far away as you can.
BOARD MEMBERS: But what about you?
BOARD MEMBERS: You can't worry about me any more. I've been a part of all
BOARD MEMBERS: the horrible things that happened. From now on I want to
BOARD MEMBERS: be part of something good. Go, James. Take all the time
BOARD MEMBERS: you need.
BOARD MEMBERS: Donna pauses, determined not to cry. She reaches in her pocket, and pulls out an ENVELOPE.
BOARD MEMBERS: It's not much, but what's babysitting money for, if you
BOARD MEMBERS: can't buy your best friend a present.
BOARD MEMBERS: I'll miss you like crazy, but you'll come back and tell me
BOARD MEMBERS: a bunch of great stories. And none of them will be about
BOARD MEMBERS: Laura, or Maddy, or Evelyn. I'll be here. And we can
BOARD MEMBERS: start over again.
BOARD MEMBERS: Come with me.
BOARD MEMBERS: No.
BOARD MEMBERS: I'll come back for you. I promise I'll -
BOARD MEMBERS: Donna silences him with a kiss, sweet and tender. Their embrace deepens. They tumble
BOARD MEMBERS: down and make love.
BOARD MEMBERS: #2.016
BOARD MEMBERS: 18. INT. BLUE PINE LODGE - NIGHT
BOARD MEMBERS: Catherine is curled up in front of the fire, sipping a cup of tea, reading a book. (Dostoyevsky's
BOARD MEMBERS: Crime and Punishment). Pete sits in his chair, meticulously TYING FLIES. A KNOCK on
BOARD MEMBERS: the door. Catherine gives Pete a look: she's not about to get up.
BOARD MEMBERS: Coming.
BOARD MEMBERS: He shuffles over to the door, and opens it on a very distraught Sheriff Truman.
BOARD MEMBERS: Pete, I need to see Josie.
BOARD MEMBERS: C'mon in. I think she went out.
BOARD MEMBERS: Yes, Sheriff, it's a little odd. She took my car, without
BOARD MEMBERS: saying a word.
BOARD MEMBERS: She told me the Great Northern.
BOARD MEMBERS: Did she? Well, she took a lot of things with her. I don't
BOARD MEMBERS: know where she was going, but I'd say she was planning to
BOARD MEMBERS: stay awile.
BOARD MEMBERS: What else did she say, Pete?
BOARD MEMBERS: Said she was seeing an old friend.
BOARD MEMBERS: Oh. Him.
BOARD MEMBERS: I suppose it's been hard on all of us. Learning the truth
BOARD MEMBERS: about Josie.
BOARD MEMBERS: Truman storms over to the phone and quickly dials.
BOARD MEMBERS: #2.016 Revised 12-19-90, BLUE
BOARD MEMBERS: 18. CONTINUED:
BOARD MEMBERS: Poor man.
BOARD MEMBERS: Agent Cooper's room, please.
BOARD MEMBERS: It's me. I'm coming over.
BOARD MEMBERS: 19. INT. GREAT NORTHERN ELEVATOR - NIGHT
BOARD MEMBERS: Eckhardt enters the elevator. Pushes a button. The MAN whose back is to him turns. It's Packard.
BOARD MEMBERS: Thomas. We meet again.
BOARD MEMBERS: Eckhardt is shocked. The doors close. Andrew pushes a button to stop the car between floors.
BOARD MEMBERS: Eckhardt reaches for a gun.
BOARD MEMBERS: That won't be necessary. As unlikely as it may sound, I'm
BOARD MEMBERS: here as a friend. Honestly, Thomas, put the gun away. I'm
BOARD MEMBERS: unarmed. Look if you like.
BOARD MEMBERS: (raises his arms to be searched, Eckhardt still
BOARD MEMBERS: holds the gun)
BOARD MEMBERS: Very well, then. If it makes you more comfortable.
BOARD MEMBERS: This is somewhat awkward.
BOARD MEMBERS: Yes, of course. It's not every day you're obliged to
BOARD MEMBERS: converse with the dead. Look closer, Thomas. I am alive.
BOARD MEMBERS: How?
BOARD MEMBERS: Guess. It's really very simple.
BOARD MEMBERS: Josie.
BOARD MEMBERS: She warned me off herself. Couldn't bear to see her
BOARD MEMBERS: beloved husband perish. Or, more realistically, I suppose,
BOARD MEMBERS: she felt there was some advantage to be gained. Whatever
BOARD MEMBERS: the case, when the True Love went up there was no one on
BOARD MEMBERS: board. Damn shame, if you ask me. I placed more value
BOARD MEMBERS: #2.016 Revised 12-19-90, BLUE
BOARD MEMBERS: 19. CONTINUED:
BOARD MEMBERS: in that boat than in most people I know. Josie included.
BOARD MEMBERS: She betrayed me.
BOARD MEMBERS: We are all familiar with betrayal.
BOARD MEMBERS: I never would have tried to kill you over business.
BOARD MEMBERS: Over Josie then?
BOARD MEMBERS: You took her from me.
BOARD MEMBERS: But you got her back, didn't you? At least, you thought
BOARD MEMBERS: you did. Almost as good. Almost the same thing.
BOARD MEMBERS: She's mine. She belongs to me.
BOARD MEMBERS: Oh, Thomas. Love will break your heart. Happily, I long
BOARD MEMBERS: ago lost interest. But Josie, she gives her heart with
BOARD MEMBERS: alarming regularity. The local sheriff, of all people.
BOARD MEMBERS: I took care of that.
BOARD MEMBERS: I don't doubt it. Sometimes I wonder if our Josie does
BOARD MEMBERS: these twisted things deliberately. Don't you?
BOARD MEMBERS: I do regret that our friendship had to end over someone
BOARD MEMBERS: so... inconstant. Josie's unpredictable nature is part of her
BOARD MEMBERS: charm, to be sure. Especially to men like us, so set in our
BOARD MEMBERS: ways. But as I grow older, I find myself placing more
BOARD MEMBERS: value in simple, unadorned, trust.
BOARD MEMBERS: Is that why you came back, Andrew? To lecture me about
BOARD MEMBERS: trust?
BOARD MEMBERS: No. As someone who was once your friend, I return with a
BOARD MEMBERS: #2.016 31.
BOARD MEMBERS: 19. CONTINUED:
BOARD MEMBERS: Ah, here we are. This must be your floor. I'll be going
BOARD MEMBERS: back down to the garage. My resurrection remains a well-
BOARD MEMBERS: kept secret.
BOARD MEMBERS: See you soon...?
BOARD MEMBERS: Goodbye, Thomas.
BOARD MEMBERS: Andrew waves cheerfully as the doors close. Eckhardt pauses to wonder, then steps away.
BOARD MEMBERS: 20. INT. GREAT NORTHERN DINING ROOM - NIGHT
BOARD MEMBERS: Ben, Audrey, and Wheeler are finishing their dinner.
BOARD MEMBERS: ... I know I have a lot to learn. And you Jack, will be my
BOARD MEMBERS: teacher. Think of me as an open book, upon whose virgin
BOARD MEMBERS: pages you shall scribe.
BOARD MEMBERS: Audrey nearly chokes on her dessert. Ben pats her on the back.
BOARD MEMBERS: What exactly do you do, Mr. Wheeler?
BOARD MEMBERS: Call me Jack. I buy bankrupt, failing businesses,
BOARD MEMBERS: streamline them, bring them up to speed, and then,
BOARD MEMBERS: usually, sell them.
BOARD MEMBERS: And at a substantial profit. But not, I should add, before
BOARD MEMBERS: making significant environmental concessions. When
BOARD MEMBERS: Jack's finished, the waste is re-routed, the air cleaner, the
BOARD MEMBERS: people happier.
BOARD MEMBERS: You make me sound like Santa Claus. I'm a businessman,
BOARD MEMBERS: that's all.
BOARD MEMBERS: The Maitre d' whispers in Ben's car. He nods and stands.
BOARD MEMBERS: #2.016 32.
BOARD MEMBERS: 20. CONTINUED:
BOARD MEMBERS: Excuse me, the Cook just tried to stab Jerry. You kids
BOARD MEMBERS: carry on.
BOARD MEMBERS: Audrey, pay attention.
BOARD MEMBERS: He hurries off. Audrey turns to Wheeler, fixes him with a level stare. She's determined to
BOARD MEMBERS: remain unimpressed. And she won't call him 'Jack.'
BOARD MEMBERS: So which is it, Mr. Wheeler? Are we bankrupt or just
BOARD MEMBERS: failing?
BOARD MEMBERS: I'm here to do an old friend a favor.
BOARD MEMBERS: My father's friends are rarer than the Pine Weasel.
BOARD MEMBERS: Ben was once a very good friend to me.
BOARD MEMBERS: And so you came back to bring us all up to speed. You are
BOARD MEMBERS: Santa Claus, Mister Wheeler. I better hang my stocking.
BOARD MEMBERS: You don't like me much, do you Audrey?
BOARD MEMBERS: I don't have an opinion either way.
BOARD MEMBERS: But if you did?
BOARD MEMBERS: If I did, I'd say that the Hornes have managed to take care
BOARD MEMBERS: of themselves just fine for more years than you can count.
BOARD MEMBERS: And, desperate though we may seem, will probably
BOARD MEMBERS: continue to do so in the foreseeable future.
BOARD MEMBERS: Audrey's matching his direct tone, adding a little bit of her father's flamboyance. She waits
BOARD MEMBERS: for Wheeler to respond, react. A beat. And he begins to laugh.
BOARD MEMBERS: What's so funny?
BOARD MEMBERS: #2.016 33.
BOARD MEMBERS: 20. CONTINUED:
BOARD MEMBERS: I was just remembering. Heidi, it's no big deal...
BOARD MEMBERS: Heidi again. I was ten, I don't know what that has to do
BOARD MEMBERS: with anything...
BOARD MEMBERS: Somehow, Ben convinced Pete Martell to play the Goat.
BOARD MEMBERS: He had these horns on, and you know Pete, he'd bleat and
BOARD MEMBERS: baah to wake the dead, loud enough that we couldn't hear
BOARD MEMBERS: poor Heidi's lines. So you kicked him. Hard. Right
BOARD MEMBERS: where he lives, as I recall...
BOARD MEMBERS: I didn't mean to hurt him...
BOARD MEMBERS: Pete started yowling even louder, for real this time, and
BOARD MEMBERS: precious, innocent little Heidi turned to the audience, pig-
BOARD MEMBERS: tails and deep dark eyes...and smiled. Ten years old and
BOARD MEMBERS: you made it very clear: Don't tread on me.
BOARD MEMBERS: Sorry. It's just that a minute ago I was starting to feel
BOARD MEMBERS: like one of Heidi's goats. Sparked a memory.
BOARD MEMBERS: Where have you been all this time? I mean, when you
BOARD MEMBERS: weren't rescuing widows and orphans and making our
BOARD MEMBERS: world a better place to live in.
BOARD MEMBERS: The far corners of the earth. It's glorious out there,
BOARD MEMBERS: Audrey. But all in all, it's nice be back home.
BOARD MEMBERS: Wheeler says it simply, without affect. Audrey's never met a man like him before. With a
BOARD MEMBERS: single exception ... Agent Cooper. And that goes straight to the heart of her.
BOARD MEMBERS: #2.016 34.
BOARD MEMBERS: 20. CONTINUED:
BOARD MEMBERS: I'm only eighteen.
BOARD MEMBERS: Excuse me?
BOARD MEMBERS: Nothing. I, uhm... look at the time. Tell my father,
BOARD MEMBERS: okay? I've got an appointment. See you... Jack
BOARD MEMBERS: Flustered, not sure exactly what she's feeling, Audrey makes a sudden exit. Wheeler sits back,
BOARD MEMBERS: as fascinated now as he was back then ... and watches her go.
BOARD MEMBERS: 21. INT. ROADHOUSE - NIGHT
BOARD MEMBERS: Shelly sits at the bar, sipping a BEER. Alone, not sure what she's waiting for. Donna walks out
BOARD MEMBERS: of the LADIES ROOM and sees Shelly. Donna goes over.
BOARD MEMBERS: Hi Shelly.
BOARD MEMBERS: Hi, how are you doing?
BOARD MEMBERS: How are you doing?
BOARD MEMBERS: Okay. You know, life.
BOARD MEMBERS: Yeah.
BOARD MEMBERS: No thanks.
BOARD MEMBERS: Waiting for James?
BOARD MEMBERS: No, I got this weird note. Asked me to meet somebody
BOARD MEMBERS: here.
BOARD MEMBERS: She lays her torn piece of paper on the bar. Shelly looks at it.
BOARD MEMBERS: That's weird all right.
BOARD MEMBERS: She takes out her own piece of paper, and lays it down next to Donna's. Two pieces of the same
BOARD MEMBERS: puzzle. Then a THIRD PIECE OF PAPER is laid down next to the other two - the puzzle is
BOARD MEMBERS: complete.
BOARD MEMBERS: #2.016 35.
BOARD MEMBERS: 21. CONTINUED:
BOARD MEMBERS: They look up - it's Audrey.
BOARD MEMBERS: Looks like we have all something to talk about.
BOARD MEMBERS: They fit together.
BOARD MEMBERS: I have dreamed so much of you
BOARD MEMBERS: walked so much, spoken, lain with your phantom...
BOARD MEMBERS: That all I have to do now perhaps is to be a phantom
BOARD MEMBERS: among phantoms and a ghost hundred times...
BOARD MEMBERS: More than the ghost who walks gaily over the sun-dial of
BOARD MEMBERS: your life.
BOARD MEMBERS: CAMERA MOVE to reveal Windom Earle, in disguise, sitting in another part of the
BOARD MEMBERS: Roadhouse watching them.
BOARD MEMBERS: 22. INT. GREAT NORTHERN LOBBY - NIGHT
BOARD MEMBERS: Sheriff Truman strides through the lobby over to the HOUSE PHONE. He picks it up.
BOARD MEMBERS: Agent Cooper, please.
BOARD MEMBERS: 23. INT. COOPER'S ROOM
BOARD MEMBERS: Cooper's loading his pistol. The PHONE RINGS, he uncoils, answering it.
BOARD MEMBERS: Cooper ... yes, Catherine. No, I was just on my way out
BOARD MEMBERS: there - she's here now? Thomas Eckhardt, all right ...
BOARD MEMBERS: Truman still on the phone.
BOARD MEMBERS: OPERATOR'S VOICE
BOARD MEMBERS: I'm sorry, that line is still busy.
BOARD MEMBERS: Truman hangs up and heads for the elevators.
BOARD MEMBERS: 24. INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR
BOARD MEMBERS: Cooper walks down a hall and around a corner. We HEAR SHOUTING. Cooper moves
BOARD MEMBERS: more quickly.
BOARD MEMBERS: #2.016 36.
BOARD MEMBERS: 24. CONTINUED:
BOARD MEMBERS: MAN'S VOICE
BOARD MEMBERS: Say it, SAY YOU DON'T LOVE HIM!!
BOARD MEMBERS: Cooper now stands outside the door.
BOARD MEMBERS: WOMAN'S VOICE
BOARD MEMBERS: No! Not as long as I live...
BOARD MEMBERS: MAN'S VOICE
BOARD MEMBERS: Then you won't.
BOARD MEMBERS: Cooper kicks the door open - just as a SHOT is FIRED.
BOARD MEMBERS: 25. INT. ECKHARDT'S SUITE
BOARD MEMBERS: Cooper bursts in on Josie lying on the bed with Eckhardt, both faces frozen, eyes wide open.
BOARD MEMBERS: It's not clear who's done what to whom. Eckhardt rises from the bed, starts towards Cooper, a
BOARD MEMBERS: knife in his hand. Then Cooper sees the blood seeping from the wand in his chest. Eckhardt
BOARD MEMBERS: stops. A pause.
BOARD MEMBERS: Josie pulls her arm out from under the covers - pointing the smoking GUN at Cooper.
BOARD MEMBERS: Eckhardt collapses.
BOARD MEMBERS: Josie holds the gun on Cooper. She's wearing traditional CHINESE PEASANT clothes that
BOARD MEMBERS: are half open, half off. No make-up, looking more like the girl she used to be.
BOARD MEMBERS: He tried ... he tried to kill me.
BOARD MEMBERS: Is that what you'll say about me? Josie, I'm not armed.
BOARD MEMBERS: Behind Cooper, Truman steps through the open door - unseen, but listening.
BOARD MEMBERS: What about Jonathan? Was he trying to kill you too?
BOARD MEMBERS: He was taking me back
BOARD MEMBERS: Truman draws his gun.
BOARD MEMBERS: And me. Why did you shoot me, Josie?
BOARD MEMBERS: You asked too many questions. I knew this day was
BOARD MEMBERS: #2.016 Revised 1-3-90, Yellow
BOARD MEMBERS: 25. CONTINUED:
BOARD MEMBERS: coming. I won't go to jail. I can't.
BOARD MEMBERS: Truman steps out into the room, points his gun at Josie.
BOARD MEMBERS: Put it down, Josie.
BOARD MEMBERS: Josie can't bear to look at Truman. Tears roll down her face, but the gun holds steady.
BOARD MEMBERS: Put it down.
BOARD MEMBERS: Harry, forgive me. I had no right to hurt you ...
BOARD MEMBERS: She cocks the gun. Still pointed at Cooper.
BOARD MEMBERS: I'm begging you. Don't make me do this.
BOARD MEMBERS: She looks at him one more time. Whispers goodbye. She turns the gun on herself. Her hand
BOARD MEMBERS: starts shaking. She exhales sharply, twice, her body seizes up and she collapses on the floor.
BOARD MEMBERS: Truman rushes to her.
BOARD MEMBERS: Josie? Josie!
BOARD MEMBERS: She's dead.
BOARD MEMBERS: Cooper looks at them and senses something more:
BOARD MEMBERS: 26. COOPER'S POV
BOARD MEMBERS: Josie and Truman disappear. A bright light appears in the room. In a hole in that light
BOARD MEMBERS: Cooper sees the Little Man from his dream, dancing by, then replaced by the face of Bob,
BOARD MEMBERS: laughing demonically. That image fades... Truman reappears, kneeling down, holding the
BOARD MEMBERS: body of Josie. Cooper continues to watch-them, trying to make sense of what he's seen.
BOARD MEMBERS: 27. ANOTHER ANGLE
BOARD MEMBERS: CAMERA drifts over to a chest of drawers, settling on a circular drawer pull. The grain of
BOARD MEMBERS: the wood seems to waver momentarily and shift and in it we see the tortured, screaming
BOARD MEMBERS: features of Josie.
CUT TO BLACK: 
CUT TO BLACK: THE END
