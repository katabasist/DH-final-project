FADE OUT: Pete grunts his disapproval, then takes a small cassette player out of a pocket in his jacket.
FADE OUT: This sparks Ben's interest, though he won't show it.

FADE OUT: He starts to turn away, Pete turns on the tape.
FADE OUT: CATHERINE'S VOICE
FADE OUT: Hello, Benjamin ...
FADE OUT: Ben freezes, then swings around, too stunned to speak.
FADE OUT: Cat got your tongue?
FADE OUT: Ben looks at Pete, who smiles.
FADE OUT: Sorry I haven't dropped by for a visit, dear, but I
FADE OUT: have a strong aversion to prisons.
FADE OUT: She's alive.
FADE OUT: Benjamin, darling, you don't look too well, why
FADE OUT: don't you sit down?
FADE OUT: He does.
FADE OUT: How often I've thought of you. You and that night
FADE OUT: we spent together lost in love ... when was that? Yes,
FADE OUT: I remember, it was the night Laura Palmer died. It
FADE OUT: seems so long ago, almost like a dream. Memory's
FADE OUT: so unreliable finally, maybe it was a dream, maybe
FADE OUT: it never happened. To tell you the truth, I can't be
FADE OUT: sure anymore.
FADE OUT: Ben springs out of the bunk over to the bars.
FADE OUT: What does she want? I'll pay it ... anything.
FADE OUT: Pete chuckles.
FADE OUT: In exchange for my testimony, you will sign the mill
FADE OUT: and Ghostwood estates back over to me. I will
FADE OUT: consider letting you keep your precious hotel.

FADE OUT: A representative of mine will come to you with the
FADE OUT: documents within 24 hours If you won't cooperate,
FADE OUT: I'm confident you'll go on from here to excel at one
FADE OUT: of the many fine career opportunities offered by the
FADE OUT: federal prison system. Ben, so nice to see you again.
FADE OUT: That Catherine ...
FADE OUT: She set me up. She set me up.
FADE OUT: She's a caution, isn't she?
FADE OUT: Pete leaves. We move in on Ben, a slow burn. He turns around, grabs a pillow from the bed,
FADE OUT: wildly attacks the bars with it.
FADE OUT: No!... no .... no ... no ... no ... no ... nooooo!
FADE OUT: We pull back, feathers floating everywhere. Ben stands in the middle of it. Lost for the first
FADE OUT: time in his life.

FADE OUT: Harry has seen it, nods "yes."
FADE OUT: Yep ...
FADE OUT: Think we've got a drop out. Look out, Harry!
FADE OUT: The truck doesn't pull over, Harry drives off the road. They're startled, but neither they or
FADE OUT: the car are damaged. They look at each other a moment. Did they see who they think they
FADE OUT: saw?
FADE OUT: Big, Ed?
FADE OUT: 22. INT. CAR - DAY
FADE OUT: Close on Big Ed behind the wheel.
FADE OUT: The sheriff approaches from behind, lights and siren blaring. Ed smiles, waves to them, obeys

FADE OUT: 23. ROAD - DAY
FADE OUT: Truman and Cooper step out of the Bronco, as does Ed out of his truck.
FADE OUT: Harry, Agent Cooper, are you all right?
FADE OUT: We're fine, Ed, you?
FADE OUT: I'm fine. I was, was just on my way out to the club
FADE OUT: to break in out some new irons. Boron. Graphite
FADE OUT: shafts. I started thinking about Laura. I guess my

FADE OUT: when you sit behind the wheel of a vehicle.
FADE OUT: Yes, of course, you're quite right. My apologies.
FADE OUT: Truman and Cooper are ready to leave it there.
FADE OUT: Oh. Oh, I did remember something. As you'd
FADE OUT: asked? The night Laura died. I was working late at
FADE OUT: the station. Around ten. Ben Horne shows up in his
FADE OUT: fancy car. He looks real agitated, talking to
FADE OUT: himself. I heard him say something about a 'dairy.'
FADE OUT: A dairy?
FADE OUT: Yes, I think so.
FADE OUT: A diary?
FADE OUT: That might've been it.
FADE OUT: Ed notices that Cooper is looking at the back of his pickup. Truman's radio crackles with a
FADE OUT: call. He goes to answer it.
FADE OUT: Are you a golfer, Agent Cooper?
FADE OUT: Yes. I enjoy its precision.
FADE OUT: May I show you my new clubs?
FADE OUT: Ed walks over to the back of his pickup. Ed picks up a club, as if it were a weapon, turns, and
FADE OUT: starts toward Cooper. Truman steps out of the Bronco.
FADE OUT: They found Gerard, near the waterfall.
FADE OUT: Let's go get him.

FADE OUT: Ed, afraid I'll hive to take a look at those clubs
FADE OUT: another time.
FADE OUT: I understand. Anything I can do to help, please let
FADE OUT: me know.
FADE OUT: We will..
FADE OUT: Cooper and Truman get in the Bronco and drive off. Ed watches them, then begins to laugh
FADE OUT: wickedly as he walks back-to the rear, throws the club inside.
FADE OUT: He climbs in behind the wheel, looks in the rear view mirror. It's "Bob."

FADE TO BLACK: Hawk walks through the station doors escorting Gerard, who's one arm is handcuffed to his
FADE TO BLACK: belt. As they pass the reception area we pick up Lucy putting a cold compress on Andy's
FADE TO BLACK: forehead. Her sister sits next to them holding the baby, keeping up a running dialogue.
FADE TO BLACK: - the same thing used to happen to me when I first
FADE TO BLACK: got pregnant, I'd be out shopping, and boom, pass
FADE TO BLACK: right out in the produce section, then come to
FADE TO BLACK: covered with bruises and crushed fruit and strangers
FADE TO BLACK: standing over waiting to see if I was dead; people
FADE TO BLACK: want terrible things to happen to you, I know -
FADE TO BLACK: Andy, who's been attempting to follow the story stares at Gwen for a moment, then turns to
FADE TO BLACK: Lucy.
FADE TO BLACK: I want to talk to you about my sperms.
FADE TO BLACK: Sperms, that's all men think about; I remember when
FADE TO BLACK: Little Kal was born they laid him on my breast
FADE TO BLACK: I looked down and saw what kind of a tiny creature
FADE TO BLACK: we were dealing with and I thought, good god, just
FADE TO BLACK: what the world doesn't need, another sperm
FADE TO BLACK: running around loose, women beware.
FADE TO BLACK: They both stare at her.
FADE TO BLACK: Well I did.
FADE TO BLACK: I had mine counted. Twice. The first time they
FADE TO BLACK: were all dead.
FADE TO BLACK: If I had a nickel for every time I heard that.
FADE TO BLACK: The second time they were jumping like salmon
FADE TO BLACK: swimming upstream.
FADE TO BLACK: So of course all you could think of was spawning.

FADE TO BLACK: 24. CONTINUED:
FADE TO BLACK: They both turn to Gwen.
FADE TO BLACK: ANDY/LUCY
FADE TO BLACK: Shut up!
FADE TO BLACK: She moves away. Andy and Lucy turn to each other.
FADE TO BLACK: So when you told me that you were pregnant I didn't
FADE TO BLACK: think it could be me because mine were all dead
FADE TO BLACK: supposedly at the time.
FADE TO BLACK: Uh-huh.
FADE TO BLACK: But they got better. I was misinformed.
FADE TO BLACK: I'm the father.
FADE TO BLACK: Oh brother ...
FADE TO BLACK: Aren't I?
FADE TO BLACK: They look at each other. Lucy puts her head in her hands.
FADE TO BLACK: 25. INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT
FADE TO BLACK: Ben Horne stands in the middle of the dimly light room. The One-Armed Man slowly circling
FADE TO BLACK: him like a blood hound. Cooper, Truman and Jerry Horne are also in the room. Gerard
FADE TO BLACK: stops, pale and weak turns away from Ben, sits, speaks softly to Cooper and Truman.
FADE TO BLACK: He has been close ... Bob is not here now ...
FADE TO BLACK: Jerry moves to them.
FADE TO BLACK: Sheriff, isn't there something you'd like to share
FADE TO BLACK: With us?
FADE TO BLACK: Gerard stares at him.

FADE TO BLACK: 25. CONTINUED:
FADE TO BLACK: And would you please ask this guy to stop staring at
FADE TO BLACK: me like I'm a dog biscuit?
FADE TO BLACK: Gerard wipes his forehead, growing weaker.
FADE TO BLACK: Bob has been very close.
FADE TO BLACK: Who's Bob? I don't know a Bob.
FADE TO BLACK: Do we know a Bob?
FADE TO BLACK: Sheriff, no offense, but clearly this man's stairs don't
FADE TO BLACK: reach all the way to the attic. Now your 24 hours are
FADE TO BLACK: up; you either charge my client or let him.
FADE TO BLACK: Hawk walks into the room, hands Truman a note. He reads it then hands it to Cooper.
FADE TO BLACK: Truman walks over and leans on the table, glares at Ben.
FADE TO BLACK: I'm charging you with the murder of Laura Palmer.
FADE TO BLACK: Good move, Jerry.
FADE TO BLACK: No, no ...
FADE TO BLACK: Hawk, take Mr. Gerard back to the hotel. Nail the
FADE TO BLACK: windows shut, I want two men on his door
FADE TO BLACK: Hawk takes Gerard and escorts him out.
FADE TO BLACK: No ... no ...

FADE TO BLACK: Harry, I think we're saddling the horse here before
FADE TO BLACK: we're ready to ride.
FADE TO BLACK: I don't follow.
FADE TO BLACK: I don't think Ben Horne killed Laura Palmer.
FADE TO BLACK: What?
FADE TO BLACK: We should release him.
FADE TO BLACK: Coop, look, I've tried to help you every step of the
FADE TO BLACK: way, I've stood by you. But I have had just about
FADE TO BLACK: enough of giants, dwarfs, dreams and throwing rocks
FADE TO BLACK: at Tibetan milk bottles. Somebody does a crime,
FADE TO BLACK: it's my job to lock 'em up. And I cannot in good
FADE TO BLACK: conscience let a man walk from my jail who I think
FADE TO BLACK: is a killer! I can't do it.
FADE TO BLACK: Cooper looks at Harry, smiles.
FADE TO BLACK: You're right. This is your backyard. Sometimes an
FADE TO BLACK: outsider can forget that.

FADE TO BLACK: Ladies ... hurry back.
FADE TO BLACK: They leave. Ernie stands for a moment then sits back down. Hank sets down the rib. They
FADE TO BLACK: study each other for a moment.
FADE TO BLACK: You're not going to say anything, are you? If Vivian
FADE TO BLACK: ever found out I was "inside," she'd leave me flat.

FADE TO BLACK: Hank puts a hand on Ernie's shoulder, gives him a rough shake. Ernie tries to smile, but
FADE TO BLACK: Hank clearly makes him nervous.
FADE TO BLACK: So what's the angle here with Miss Moneybags,
FADE TO BLACK: anyway?
FADE TO BLACK: There's no angle.
FADE TO BLACK: Come on, buddy, we never had any secrets. Vivian's

FADE TO BLACK: You musta told her some tall tale. A whopper.
FADE TO BLACK: I am trying very hard to tell nothing but the truth
FADE TO BLACK: these days. It's therapeutic.
FADE TO BLACK: Vivian wants me to handle all her investments.
FADE TO BLACK: What about yours? You gonna introduce her to your

FADE TO BLACK: I'm out of it, Hank. I don't gamble anymore. I go
FADE TO BLACK: to meetings. I go to church, too.
FADE TO BLACK: So does Vivian know you ran off with the
FADE TO BLACK: congregation's picnic fund?
FADE TO BLACK: I would never steal from a church. It was a savings
FADE TO BLACK: and loan. I was sick, it was an illness and I've paid

FADE TO BLACK: family is the most important thing in the world to
FADE TO BLACK: me. And one must be prepared to pay any price ...
FADE TO BLACK: to protect it. Wouldn't you agree?
FADE TO BLACK: I completely agree.
