REVISED: Knocks on the door.
REVISED: TRUMAN'S VOICE
REVISED: Mr. Smith? Mr. Smith, it's the police, open the door ...
REVISED: Mr. Smith, we have a warrant to search your apartment ...
REVISED: The doorknob turns. The door swings open; a beat, then TRUMAN, COOPER and HAWK
REVISED: pour into the room, weapons drawn. The room has been ravaged. Smith's diaries, torn and
REVISED: tattered lie in a pile of paper in the middle of the room. CAMERA follows Truman and
REVISED: Cooper across the room and up to the window looking in the greenhouse ... where we see
REVISED: Smith's legs suspended swinging He's hung himself. Cooper and Truman look at each other.

REVISED: Cooper enters leading a haggard looking PHIL GERARD, the one-armed man, still in his
REVISED: "Mike" stare. Cooper raises a hand, stops the gurney, gestures to Gerard. Gerard puts his

REVISED: Was he here?
REVISED: Bob never lingers after death.
REVISED: Was he here?
REVISED: Bob has not visited here.
REVISED: #2.007
REVISED: 3. CONTINUED:
REVISED: Truman rolls his eyes. Cooper nods to the Paramedics; they wheel Smith out. Gerard,
REVISED: unsteady on his feet, seeks refuge in a chair. Truman takes Cooper quietly aside.
REVISED: Think this is a good idea, in front of the men and all?
REVISED: Harry, we're at the chicken-soup stage of this crime.
REVISED: How's that?
REVISED: "It couldn't hurt."
REVISED: That's something people say back in Philadelphia.
REVISED: Truman produces Smith's wallet.
REVISED: We're trying to get ahold of Jacoby in Hawaii; Smith
REVISED: was a patient.
REVISED: Was the agoraphobia for real. Did he ever go outside.
REVISED: He was a class "A" nutball, that much seems clear.
REVISED: Blood type?
REVISED: We'll have it soon.
REVISED: Wouldn't hurt for Jacoby to get a gander at this guy
REVISED: either.
REVISED: Looks a little green around the gills.
REVISED: It's not easy being "Mike."
REVISED: Would you like some coffee, "Mike"?
REVISED: Gerard shakes his head. Hawk unearths something from the large paper scrap pile, moves
REVISED: with it to Cooper.
REVISED: Take a look at this.

REVISED: completely.
REVISED: You do?
REVISED: You've been a wonderful help.
REVISED: You'll come back to visit, won't you?
REVISED: Of course.

REVISED: Forty-two dollars. Forty-two dollars.

REVISED: Bobby, you said you were gonna take care of -
REVISED: I am. I am, Shelly.
REVISED: I want you to take the necklace back -
REVISED: We don't have to do that -
REVISED: Shelly retrieves the box from her hiding place.
REVISED: I want you to take it back, we need the money -
REVISED: Shelly, you're gonna keep that necklace -
REVISED: #2.007
REVISED: 7. CONTINUED:
REVISED: When am I ever gonna feel glamorous enough to wear it?
REVISED: Giving Leo a bath? Feeding him his oatmeal?
REVISED: What about his truck? He's not gonna be cannonballing
REVISED: down the highway any time soon, it must be worth a -
REVISED: The police impounded it -
REVISED: We'll get it back -
REVISED: They said if it was used in the commission of a crime it
REVISED: becomes property of the state -
REVISED: But they haven't charged him with anything -
REVISED: I didn't make the rules!
REVISED: Okay, okay -
REVISED: It's like you're blaming me for something -
REVISED: I'm not blaming you. Take it easy.
REVISED: Leo was into a lot of stuff and he was in it for the money.
REVISED: He must've had partners. We could ask them.
REVISED: Not a good idea.
REVISED: But so you think Leo had money?
REVISED: Yes. And from the look of that checkbook he never saw
REVISED: the inside of a bank. He had hiding places.
REVISED: #2.007
REVISED: 7. CONTINUED:
REVISED: Snaps his fingers in front of Leo's face.
REVISED: Leo, you in there? Hey, Leo ...
REVISED: where did you put the money? M-o-n-e-y -
REVISED: Leo needs new shooooes ...
REVISED: Maybe a pair of house slippers, pal. And they'll
REVISED: probably last you a few decades.
REVISED: New shooooes.
REVISED: Bobby gets a hint of something
REVISED: He buy any shoes lately?
REVISED: No. The police went through everything he owned.
REVISED: New shoooes ...
REVISED: He did have me take a pair of boots in for repair.
REVISED: When?
REVISED: Last week.
REVISED: Have you got the receipt?
REVISED: You think he had something in -
REVISED: I don't know. Get the receipt.

REVISED: 8. EXT. SHERIFF'S STATION - DAY
REVISED: 9. INT. SHERIFF'S STATION - DAY
REVISED: A weak and pale Phillip Gerard sits in the reception area, attended to by Doc Hayward. The
REVISED: plumber we saw in #006, MR ZIPPER is on a ladder, working on the nozzles of the sprinkler
REVISED: system he's in the middle of installing throughout the station.
REVISED: CLOSE on a couple of steaming cups of coffee as they're carried into the conference room,
REVISED: where Truman and Cooper, are seated at the table. Wearing surgical gloves, Cooper is
REVISED: paging through the diary they found at Harold Smith's. Open beside him is the original diary
REVISED: they found in Laura's room. Cooper compares the two, takes a sip of coffee.
REVISED: This is Laura's handwriting.
REVISED: Why would she keep two diaries?
REVISED: The one we found earlier was a record of events on the
REVISED: surface. This one apparently tells the story of her inner
REVISED: life.
REVISED: The answer may be in there.
REVISED: Undoubtedly. It's a shame. Mr. Smith saw fit to
REVISED: mutilate about 45% of the contents.
REVISED: Hawk enters, carrying an envidence bag containing some torn scraps of paper.
REVISED: This what you're looking for?
REVISED: #2.007
REVISED: 9. CONTINUED:
REVISED: Precisely.
REVISED: Cooper opens the bag, takes out the scraps and examines them with a magnifying glass,
REVISED: comparing them to the second diary.
REVISED: Those are the scraps you found near the railroad car.
REVISED: Hawk nods.
REVISED: Yes. Yes. This is where the scraps came from.
REVISED: Look at this.
REVISED: He points to a section torn out near the end of the book.
REVISED: Smith ready did a job on this thing.
REVISED: No, look at the way the pages are torn clean, ripped out
REVISED: at the roots. Smith ripped and slashed his way through,
REVISED: like the others we found in his apartment.
REVISED: And look at the edges here at the back; yellowed and
REVISED: curled. Nine pages. They were taken some time ago.
REVISED: By Smith?
REVISED: By the killer. The day she died.
REVISED: Truman takes the book to examine it.
REVISED: Before she gave the book to Smith?
REVISED: Unless I'm very much mistaken.
REVISED: Doc Hayward appears in the doorway, with news, a piece of paper in his hand.
REVISED: Excuse me, fellas ...
REVISED: #2.007
REVISED: 9. CONTINUED:
REVISED: What was Harold Smith's bloodtype, Doc?
REVISED: "O."
REVISED: The night Laura died Harold Smith never left his
REVISED: apartment.
REVISED: Agent Cooper, just so you know, Gerard is refusing to
REVISED: take his drug -
REVISED: You mean "Mike."
REVISED: Whatever his name is, he's getting weak and unstable. I
REVISED: can't recommend we let him go much longer without his
REVISED: medication.
REVISED: Oh my Lord ... oh my Lord ...
REVISED: Harry?
REVISED: "... he can can come into my mind, a man who can slip
REVISED: in and out of you like a wind that goes unnoticed ... it
REVISED: just struck me that his name is a warning in itself; B-O-
REVISED: B: Beware of Bob."
REVISED: Hawk, bring the cruiser around, Harry, bring the diary,
REVISED: I'll get Gerard, we're taking him to the Great Northern
REVISED: Hotel.

FADE OUT: 10. EXT. GREAT NORTHERN HOTEL - DAY
FADE OUT: 11. INT. GREAT NORTHERN HOTEL LOBBY - DAY
FADE OUT: A police presence in the lobby has created quite a stir: DEPUTIES are shepherding an
FADE OUT: interesting mix of HOTEL GUESTS, one by one, past Gerard, seated front of the
FADE OUT: fireplace. Included are the members of a HIGH SCHOOL MARCHING BAND, each
FADE OUT: holding their instrument.
FADE OUT: Gerard, pale and sweaty, scrutinizes each guest as they are brought before him, shakes his
FADE OUT: head and they move on. Cooper and Truman stand beside him, Cooper stalwart, Truman
FADE OUT: exuding a healthy skepticism.
FADE OUT: Doc Hayward is nearby, keeping an eye on Gerard.
FADE OUT: SUNSHIH TOJAMURA is shown to Gerard. Gerard shakes his head.
FADE OUT: 12. INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - DAY
FADE OUT: Under a head of angry steam, BEN HORNE makes his way down the corridor.
FADE OUT: 13. INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY
FADE OUT: As he eyeballs two visiting FISHERMEN in Tyrolean hats, Gerard starts to hyperventilate.
FADE OUT: trying to loosen his collar. Hayward moves to him.
FADE OUT: Doc?
FADE OUT: Give him room.
FADE OUT: I can't, I can't -
FADE OUT: Behind them the elevator doors open and Ben Horne strides towards the scene, reaching
FADE OUT: them just as -
FADE OUT: My arm!
FADE OUT: #2.007
FADE OUT: 13. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: Gerard passes out.
FADE OUT: Let's get some room here.
FADE OUT: This has gone on long enough -
FADE OUT: What's the meaning of this? Sheriff, what's going on,
FADE OUT: Why are my guests being hounded like this?
FADE OUT: We're done here, Mr. Horne -
FADE OUT: Thank you all ladies and gentlemen. If everyone would
FADE OUT: please just go about your business.
FADE OUT: We've got to get him to a bed.
FADE OUT: Mr. Horne, could we have the use of a room?
FADE OUT: Does he want to check-in?
FADE OUT: A look from Cooper asks a favor. Horne complies, points.
FADE OUT: Down the corridor.
FADE OUT: Horne moves to the front desk to retrieve a key.
FADE OUT: Is he all right?
FADE OUT: He needs his medication.
FADE OUT: Come on, fellas, we better carry him.
FADE OUT: #2.007
FADE OUT: 13. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: They pick up the limp Gerard and carry him off down the corridor. Cooper collects the key
FADE OUT: from Horne.
FADE OUT: How's Audrey this morning?
FADE OUT: Tip-top.
FADE OUT: Cooper takes the key and follows the others. Horne moves in a different direction.
FADE OUT: 14. INT. BEN HORNE'S OFFICE - DAY
FADE OUT: Horne enters. AUDREY's in the room, back facing the door.
FADE OUT: Audrey
FADE OUT: She turns. A strong, solemn look.
FADE OUT: Shouldn't you still be in bed?
FADE OUT: I've spent enough time in bed lately.
FADE OUT: You're looking much, much better.
FADE OUT: He tries to kiss her. She turns her cheek. Looks at him. Ben starts evasive actions, checks his
FADE OUT: desk calender.
FADE OUT: Audrey, dear, if you'd excuse me, I've got a business
FADE OUT: meeting scheduled -
FADE OUT: I know about One-Eyed Jacks.
FADE OUT: What's that?
FADE OUT: You heard me.
FADE OUT: I know about Blackie. I know about Emory Battis. I
FADE OUT: know about Ronnette and I know about Laura.
FADE OUT: #2.007
FADE OUT: 14. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: Ben sits. A cold sweat.
FADE OUT: I'm sure I don't know what you're talking about -
FADE OUT: Dad, I've been listening to you lie and cheat and chisel
FADE OUT: all my life. I know every move in your book, so my
FADE OUT: advice is: don't waste your breath.
FADE OUT: I see ... your point.
FADE OUT: I was there. I saw you.
FADE OUT: Uh-huh.
FADE OUT: I need to ask you some so questions.
FADE OUT: Ask away.
FADE OUT: No lying.
FADE OUT: I'll do my best.
FADE OUT: You'd better do better than that.
FADE OUT: Ask.
FADE OUT: Did you have anything to do with my being kidnapped?
FADE OUT: No, I swear on your mother's life -
FADE OUT: Leave Mom out of this -
FADE OUT: No. No, no, no. God, no.
FADE OUT: #2.007
FADE OUT: 14. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: Did you know Jean Renault was going to kill Emory and
FADE OUT: Blackie?
FADE OUT: Serves them right, doesn't it? They're the ones who
FADE OUT: kidnapped you -
FADE OUT: Did you know?
FADE OUT: No.
FADE OUT: How long have you owned One-Eyed Jacks?
FADE OUT: Five years.
FADE OUT: Did you know Laura worked there?
FADE OUT: She was only there a brief time -
FADE OUT: Did you know?
FADE OUT: Yes.
FADE OUT: Did you in any way encourage her to work there?
FADE OUT: No, I had no idea. She asked for a job at the
FADE OUT: department store, Battis sent her without my knowing -
FADE OUT: But you found out.
FADE OUT: I saw her there, yes.
FADE OUT: Did you sleep with her?
FADE OUT: #2.007
FADE OUT: 14. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: Yes.
FADE OUT: Did you kill her?
FADE OUT: Ben's face twists in a contortion of pain and horror. He shakes his head, but we're not sure if
FADE OUT: it's anger or denial. His voice quavers, tears fill his eyes.
FADE OUT: I ... loved ... her.
FADE OUT: He breaks down. Audrey regards her father coldly. She starts away.
FADE OUT: What are you doing? Where are you going?
FADE OUT: What are you going to do?
FADE OUT: Audrey stops at the door, gives him a long look. Then exits. Ben tries es to dry his tears,
FADE OUT: compose himself. He blows his nose in a handkerchief.

FADE OUT: NORMA JENNINGS is behind the counter, going over some bills. Shelly comes in from
FADE OUT: the kitchen. A slow part of the day.
FADE OUT: If I'd thought out what it was going to do to my laundry
FADE OUT: bills I never would've let Hank talk me into those
FADE OUT: tablecloths.
FADE OUT: I think they look pretty. Where is he, anyway?
FADE OUT: He must have some business. Or maybe it's radar; my
FADE OUT: mother called, she's coming into town. Hank's kind of
FADE OUT: #2.007
FADE OUT: 17. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: allergic to her.
FADE OUT: Norma, could we talk for a second?
FADE OUT: Sure. What's up?
FADE OUT: What with Leo coming home and everything, you know
FADE OUT: I'm supposed to be taking care of him and all and it
FADE OUT: seems like it's going to be a pretty full time thing, so I
FADE OUT: was thinking I'm going to have to, you know, quit my
FADE OUT: job, for a while at least anyway and ... oh shoot ...
FADE OUT: She can't continue. Norma hugs her,
FADE OUT: I promised I wasn't gonna to do this ...
FADE OUT: You go ahead.
FADE OUT: Anyway, I feel so bad ... 'cause I love you and I love
FADE OUT: working here and I don't want to let you down -
FADE OUT: You're not going to let me down.

FADE OUT: Shelly, you've got your own life to worry about right
FADE OUT: now. I'll be fine here.
FADE OUT: You sure?
FADE OUT: Yes. And as soon as you're ready you come right back,
FADE OUT: it'll be like you never missed a day.
FADE OUT: You'll let me come back?
FADE OUT: #2.007
FADE OUT: 17. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: You just try and take a job someplace else and see what
FADE OUT: happens.
FADE OUT: I don't know what to say.
FADE OUT: You don't have to say anything.
FADE OUT: BIG ED and NADINE enter. Nadine's wearing a girlish outfit. Ed's got a pained
FADE OUT: expression to match.
FADE OUT: - so they sent me in to my senior counselor and I told
FADE OUT: him I'd been traveling with my parents for a while but
FADE OUT: now I wanted to register for spring semester - come on,
FADE OUT: Eddie, let's sit at the counter -
FADE OUT: Nadine drags Ed by the hand to the counter.
FADE OUT: - I could just die for a chocolate shake, couldn't you?
FADE OUT: Hi Norma, say how long have you been working here?
FADE OUT: Twenty years in April.
FADE OUT: Nadine's brow furrows up. Ed tries to gesture to Norma behind Nadine's back.
FADE OUT: You kidder. What a kidder.
FADE OUT: 'Bout six weeks now, isn't it Norma?
FADE OUT: That's right.
FADE OUT: You see? Your parents drag you off to Europe or
FADE OUT: someplace for a month and it's like you've been gone
FADE OUT: forever - two chocolate shakes please, Norma, extra
FADE OUT: whipped cream on mine - hi, what's your name?

FADE OUT: 17. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: Shelly.
FADE OUT: Are you in our class at school?
FADE OUT: I don't think so.
FADE OUT: Europe?
FADE OUT: Yeah. They love it so much they're still over there, can
FADE OUT: you believe it? So they said it was okay for me to stay
FADE OUT: over at Eddie's, isn't that right, Eddie?
FADE OUT: That's right.
FADE OUT: Another helpless gesture to Norma
FADE OUT: Say Norma, you're not mad or anything that Eddie and
FADE OUT: I are sort of going out or anything are you?
FADE OUT: You and Ed?
FADE OUT: No. No. Why should I be?
FADE OUT: No reason. I know you two broke up and everything.
FADE OUT: I'm just so sweet on him is all.
FADE OUT: Isn't he just the dreamiest? I can't wait for the start of
FADE OUT: football season, can you?
FADE OUT: No. Can't wait.
FADE OUT: Me neither.
FADE OUT: They all look at her. The coffee cup she's been idly toying, with shatters in her hand.
FADE OUT: God, sorry, there's go another one, I have been so clumsy
FADE OUT: #2.007
FADE OUT: 17. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: lately I can hardly believe it.
FADE OUT: I'll get another one.
FADE OUT: I'll make your shakes.
FADE OUT: They move off. Nadine snuggles up to Ed.
FADE OUT: Eddie, I'm so happy I could kiss you to death.

FADE TO BLACK: He pulls out an old pair of Circle brand work boots.
FADE TO BLACK: New shooes ...
FADE TO BLACK: No, you knucklehead, old shoes. Leo, he gets fixated on
FADE TO BLACK: things pretty easily.
FADE TO BLACK: Looks like he's been permanently fixated.
FADE TO BLACK: Leo laughs.
FADE TO BLACK: Leo, I know you too damn well. There's something in
FADE TO BLACK: these, isn't there?

FADE TO BLACK: Bobby, I think he said something once about muling
FADE TO BLACK: stuff in his boot.
FADE TO BLACK: Leo, don't go anywhere.
FADE TO BLACK: Bobby, gets up, rummages through a drawer, comes up with a hammer, puts the boots on
FADE TO BLACK: the table and starts whacking at the heel. The first heel comes off, revealing a small, secret
FADE TO BLACK: and empty compartment in its hollow center, shows it to Mike.
FADE TO BLACK: How about that? Come on Leo, sing with me ...
FADE TO BLACK: Bobby sings, hammering in time to the music on the other boot.
FADE TO BLACK: "I've been working on the railroad all the live long, day/
FADE TO BLACK: I've been working on the railroad just to pass the time
FADE TO BLACK: away -"
FADE TO BLACK: The heel comes off. Bobby picks up the contents of the secret compartment: a small, micro
FADE TO BLACK: cassette.
FADE TO BLACK: "Where's my ten grand?"
FADE TO BLACK: It's not money, you nitwit.

FADE TO BLACK: I loved her. There, I said it. No offense, Harry.
FADE TO BLACK: I loved her, too. I stood there and watched her go.
FADE TO BLACK: Watched her assistant carry out her bags.
FADE TO BLACK: Pause. Something breaks through Pete's melancholic haze.
FADE TO BLACK: Assistant?
FADE TO BLACK: Asian fella. Never seen him before. Woo?
FADE TO BLACK: What'd he look like?
FADE TO BLACK: Average height. Medium build. Pony tail.
FADE TO BLACK: That was her cousin. Jonathan.
FADE TO BLACK: She said he was her assistant. British accent -
FADE TO BLACK: This guy could barely speak English.
FADE TO BLACK: Pete, this was the same guy.
FADE TO BLACK: Harry, I've got a bad feeling.
FADE TO BLACK: I'm right there with you.
FADE TO BLACK: Pause.

FADE TO BLACK: 23. INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
FADE TO BLACK: Remanants of Laura's diary are spread out over the entire conference table. Cooper
FADE TO BLACK: examines the remaining intact pages in the book, making notes, using a magnifying glass and
FADE TO BLACK: what scraps he has in front of him to try and reconstruct the contents. He steps away from
FADE TO BLACK: the table, picks up a cup of coffe and his microrecorder.
FADE TO BLACK: Diane, it's 5:45 pm, I'm in the conference room with the
FADE TO BLACK: remains of Laura Palmer's diary. A great deal of it has
FADE TO BLACK: been destroyed, many of Laura's secrets along with it.
FADE TO BLACK: Much of what I've been able to decipher supports the
FADE TO BLACK: contention of the one-armed man; there are repeated
FADE TO BLACK: references to "Bob". He was a threatening presence in her
FADE TO BLACK: life from early adolescence. There are intimations of
FADE TO BLACK: abuse, molestation. On a regular basis. He is referred
FADE TO BLACK: to, on more than one occasion, as a friend of her father's.
FADE TO BLACK: And I've just uncovered this entry, dated less than two
FADE TO BLACK: weeks before her death.
FADE TO BLACK: "One of these days I'm going to tell the world about
FADE TO BLACK: Ben Horne. I'm going to tell the world who Ben Horne
FADE TO BLACK: really is."
FADE TO BLACK: The door swings open. Audrey Horne is standing in the doorway.
FADE TO BLACK: Audrey ...
FADE TO BLACK: Cooper turns off the tape recorder. Audrey enters, closes the door behind her.
FADE TO BLACK: I had to see you, I'm sorry -
FADE TO BLACK: Are you all right?
FADE TO BLACK: She waves off the question. Something much larger looming over her. Trying to bear up
FADE TO BLACK: under its weight.
FADE TO BLACK: I spoke with my father.
FADE TO BLACK: Okay.
FADE TO BLACK: He was sleeping with her. With Laura. I don't know for
FADE TO BLACK: how long. Maybe quite a while.
FADE TO BLACK: #2.007
FADE TO BLACK: 23. CONTINUED:
FADE TO BLACK: Okay.
FADE TO BLACK: She was up at One-Eyed Jack's. Working there. My
FADE TO BLACK: father owns the place. That's what I found out.
FADE TO BLACK: Are you sure?
FADE TO BLACK: Yes.
FADE TO BLACK: And Laura knew it too. Laura knew it too.
FADE TO BLACK: Pause. Cooper moves to the door.
FADE TO BLACK: What are you gonna do?
FADE TO BLACK: Harry?
FADE TO BLACK: What are you gonna do?
FADE TO BLACK: Cooper takes her by the shoulders.
FADE TO BLACK: I don't want you to have to testify. I'm going to try to
FADE TO BLACK: see that that doesn't happen.
FADE TO BLACK: What are you gonna do?
FADE TO BLACK: Don't say a word to anyone. Go home. Stay in your
FADE TO BLACK: room. I'll try to come see you later. Don't answer the
FADE TO BLACK: phone -
FADE TO BLACK: Truman appears in the doorway.
FADE TO BLACK: You're going, to arrest him.
FADE TO BLACK: #2.007
FADE TO BLACK: 23. CONTINUED:
FADE TO BLACK: Yes.
FADE TO BLACK: She gently disengages herself from him, nods. Tries to smile, but the attempt fails.
FADE TO BLACK: I've got to tell Johnny.
FADE TO BLACK: Why don't you do that?
FADE TO BLACK: Okay.
FADE TO BLACK: She moves out like a sleepwalker.
FADE TO BLACK: Have somebody drive her back to the hotel.
FADE TO BLACK: What's going on
FADE TO BLACK: We need a warrant. A warrant for the arrest of Ben
FADE TO BLACK: Horne.
FADE TO BLACK: They look at each other. Truman nods, grimly, heads out. Cooper looks sadly down at the
FADE TO BLACK: remanants of the diary.
FADE TO BLACK: 
FADE TO BLACK: #2.007
FADE TO BLACK: 24. EXT. PALMER HOUSE - NIGHT
FADE TO BLACK: 25- INT. PALMER HOUSE - NIGHT
FADE TO BLACK: SARAH PALMER crawls in on the floor. She appears to have been drugged, fighting to stay
FADE TO BLACK: awake. She looks up at the living room and has a vision: A PALE HORSE is standing in the
FADE TO BLACK: middle of the room.
FADE TO BLACK: 26. INT. PALMER HOUSE - NIGHT
FADE TO BLACK: Madeleine enters, carrying a couple of packed bags which she sets down, calling back to
FADE TO BLACK: someone outside of the room.
FADE TO BLACK: I'm going to leave these down here tonight. I'll be all
FADE TO BLACK: ready to get an early start.
FADE TO BLACK: Behind her in the alcove, Ben Horne comes down the stairs, stops to look at himself in the
FADE TO BLACK: mirror. He smoothes back his hair. We move to notice that the face staring back out of the
FADE TO BLACK: mirror is "Bob."
FADE TO BLACK: We follow Ben's hand into his pocket. He takes out a pair of rubber surgical gloves and starts
FADE TO BLACK: to put them on as he moves toward the living room.
FADE TO BLACK: Madeleine has finished fussing over his luggage. She turns and notices Sarah stretched out on
FADE TO BLACK: the floor beside the sofa.
FADE TO BLACK: Aunt Sarah? ... Aunt Sarah? ...
FADE TO BLACK: As she bends over to look at her, Ben moves in behind her, raising his hands.
FADE TO BLACK: 
FADE TO BLACK: 27. INT. BEN HORNE'S OFFICE - NIGHT
FADE TO BLACK: A fax is arriving over the fax machine. Ben Horne crouches over the machine, eagerly rips off
FADE TO BLACK: the transmission as it's completed. He scans it, smiles and folds it.
FADE TO BLACK: #2.007
FADE TO BLACK: 27. CONTINUED:
FADE TO BLACK: Good news, Mr. Tojamura.
FADE TO BLACK: TOJAMURA is seated in the office, his VALET a shadow.
FADE TO BLACK: My brother Jerry has spoken with your people in Osaka,
FADE TO BLACK: he's checked your references with the Tokyo banks and
FADE TO BLACK: the answer to your proposal my good friend is a big
FADE TO BLACK: thumbs-up.
FADE TO BLACK: We appreciate your promptness.
FADE TO BLACK: Speaking for the entire community of Twin Peaks, I
FADE TO BLACK: can't tell you how pleased we are to welcome you into
FADE TO BLACK: the Ghostwood fold.
FADE TO BLACK: Thank you so much.
FADE TO BLACK: He snaps his fingers; the Valet produces a thick sheath of contracts.
FADE TO BLACK: Contracts. For your perusal.
FADE TO BLACK: And fast approval, I'm sure.
FADE TO BLACK: Horne accepts the contracts. A knock at the door. The door opens. Cooper, Truman and
FADE TO BLACK: Hawk. Truman walks right in.
FADE TO BLACK: Sheriff?
FADE TO BLACK: Mr. Horne, we'd like you to come with us please.
FADE TO BLACK: Fine, I happen to be in a meeting -
FADE TO BLACK: You're wanted for questioning in the murder of Laura
FADE TO BLACK: Palmer, is that specific enough for you?
FADE TO BLACK: Horne looks from Truman to Cooper.
FADE TO BLACK: #2.007
FADE TO BLACK: 27. CONTINUED:
FADE TO BLACK: You're insane -
FADE TO BLACK: Tojamura has retreated a few steps. Horne turns to him.
FADE TO BLACK: There's been a dreadful mistake.
FADE TO BLACK: Come with us now or would you rather go out through
FADE TO BLACK: your lobby in handcuffs.
FADE TO BLACK: Cooper, what kind of a sick joke is this?
FADE TO BLACK: You'd better do as he says.
FADE TO BLACK: They take him by the arms. Horne struggles, yelling, composure completely gone.
FADE TO BLACK: No! No! You can't do this! You can't do this!
FADE TO BLACK: Truman and Hawk drag him out the door, Cooper follows
FADE TO BLACK: Tojamura watches them exit. His eyes are bright. He may be laughing.
FADE TO BLACK: 28. EXT. BLUE PINE LODGE - NIGHT
FADE TO BLACK: 29. INT. BLUE PINE LODGE - NIGHT
FADE TO BLACK: Dim light. In his bathrobe and slippers, Pete putters around the kitchen, humming, heating
FADE TO BLACK: up a glass of milk. Far off he hears a gust of wind, the sound of a door in the distance. He
FADE TO BLACK: looks up, nothing, finishes fixing his milk. Takes the glass, at a last minute grabs a cookie and
FADE TO BLACK: heads off. He comes around the corner and nearly screams when he finds himself nearly face
FADE TO BLACK: to face with Tojamura.
FADE TO BLACK: Who the heck are you?
FADE TO BLACK: Tojamura advances towards him, doesn't say a word.
FADE TO BLACK: #2.007
FADE TO BLACK: 29. CONTINUED:
FADE TO BLACK: How'd you get in here? Hey - hey!
FADE TO BLACK: Tojamura grabs him and kisses him. Pete drops the glass of milk to the floor. Pete struggles.
FADE TO BLACK: Tojamura pulls back from the embrace. Pete frantically tries to wipe off his lips.
FADE TO BLACK: Since the moment we met, I've found myself strangely
FADE TO BLACK: attracted to you.
FADE TO BLACK: Mister, you better get out of here -
FADE TO BLACK: There's something about your eyes; they're warm and
FADE TO BLACK: deep -
FADE TO BLACK: - and blue as the open sky.
FADE TO BLACK: Huh?
FADE TO BLACK: Pete ... it's me.
FADE TO BLACK: It's Catherine, you dummy.
FADE TO BLACK: Tojamura takes off his glasses. Pete sees something he recognizes. Tears come to his eyes.
FADE TO BLACK: Oh my God ... you look terrible.
FADE TO BLACK: 30. INT. SHERIFF'S STATION - NIGHT
FADE TO BLACK: Truman, Cooper and Hawk enter with Ben Horne. The Log Lady is waiting in the reception
FADE TO BLACK: area; she rises. Cooper notices her, looks to Truman.
FADE TO BLACK: Take Mr. Horne down to the holding cell.
FADE TO BLACK: Hawk and Horne move off. Cooper moves to the Log Lady, Truman follows.
FADE TO BLACK: You must go to the Roadhouse. Everything points that
FADE TO BLACK: way.
FADE TO BLACK: #2.007
FADE TO BLACK: 30. CONTINUED:
FADE TO BLACK: Why?
FADE TO BLACK: It won't say. But it insists.
FADE TO BLACK: Cooper looks at Truman.
FADE TO BLACK: We can't question Horne 'til his lawyer gets here; he's
FADE TO BLACK: flying back from Japan, won't be here 'til morning. I
FADE TO BLACK: could use a beer myself.
FADE TO BLACK: All right.
FADE TO BLACK: 31. INT. ROADHOUSE - NIGHT
FADE TO BLACK: A band is playing on stage. DONNA HAYWARD enters. She looks for and finds where
FADE TO BLACK: James is seated, his back to her, reading.
FADE TO BLACK: You heard about Harold Smith?
FADE TO BLACK: Yeah.
FADE TO BLACK: She sits. James sets the book down. They look at each other.
FADE TO BLACK: It's not your fault, Donna
FADE TO BLACK: No?
FADE TO BLACK: I don't think it's anybody's fault. He was a sick guy.
FADE TO BLACK: He wasn't bad.
FADE TO BLACK: You don't think he killed Laura?
FADE TO BLACK: #2.007
FADE TO BLACK: 31. CONTINUED:
FADE TO BLACK: I don't think so. I think he was ... mixed up. I think he
FADE TO BLACK: was hurt inside in a way I didn't understand.
FADE TO BLACK: Everybody's hurt inside. That doesn't mean you can go
FADE TO BLACK: around trying to knock somebody's brains out.
FADE TO BLACK: I think he was defending himself. His life was in that
FADE TO BLACK: room, his whole life, and we violated that -
FADE TO BLACK: Donna, are you defending him?
FADE TO BLACK: No. But he didn't kill Laura. Maybe he was sick and
FADE TO BLACK: what he did was wrong. But he didn't deserve to die for
FADE TO BLACK: it.
FADE TO BLACK: You better be clear about this; that was his choice. If he
FADE TO BLACK: didn't want to live there was nothing you or the police or
FADE TO BLACK: anybody could do to change that.
FADE TO BLACK: Kind of like Laura.
FADE TO BLACK: I guess so.
FADE TO BLACK: God ... nobody told us life was going to be like this.
FADE TO BLACK: James takes her hand.
FADE TO BLACK: Maybe nobody knew.
FADE TO BLACK: They look at each other other, draw some comfort from the thought.
FADE TO BLACK: Go for a ride?
FADE TO BLACK: She nods. Tears in her eyes. They exit. We pick up and stay with Cooper and Truman as they
FADE TO BLACK: enter through another door, move to the bar and order beers. The singer on stage begins a
FADE TO BLACK: new song.
FADE TO BLACK: #2.007
FADE TO BLACK: 31. CONTINUED:
FADE TO BLACK: What do we do?
FADE TO BLACK: I don't know. Wait.
FADE TO BLACK: They watch the band; it's an emotional song, filled with regret and longing. People lean
FADE TO BLACK: forward, drawn in by the song, but also by a mounting, palpable sense of tension and fear in
FADE TO BLACK: the air.
FADE TO BLACK: Cooper picks up on it, looks at Truman, who feels it as well.
INTERCUT: 
INTERCUT: 32. COOPER'S POV - THE STAGE
INTERCUT: In mid-song, the band vanishes from the stage; the Giant appears in the center of the stage.
INTERCUT: He looks right at Cooper.
INTERCUT: It's happening again. It's happening again.
INTERCUT: Cooper appears to be the only one who sees him. He looks again, unsure of what he's seen.
INTERCUT: The Giant fades away, replaced by the band once again, who finish the song.
INTERCUT: Cooper sits stock still, shocked by what he's seen. Truman looks at him.
INTERCUT: Cooper? Cooper?
INTERCUT: Someone pats Cooper on the shoulder. Cooper looks up. It's the old ROOM SERVICE
INTERCUT: WAITER from the Great Northern Hotel. His eyes are filled with tears. He shakes his head,
INTERCUT: pats Cooper on the shoulder again and moves off.
INTERCUT: Cooper stares straight ahead.
INTERCUT: He's killed again.
FADE TO BLACK: 
FADE TO BLACK: THE END
