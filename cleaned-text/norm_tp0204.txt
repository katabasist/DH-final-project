REVISED: 1. INT. SHERIFF'S INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY
REVISED: START CLOSE on LELAND PALMER, his face a dark mask of grief. SHERIFF
REVISED: TRUMAN'S voice is heard:
REVISED: TRUMAN'S VOICE
REVISED: Leland, you have the right to an attorney.
REVISED: Leland ... ?
REVISED: No, no. I waive that right. I'm a lawyer ...
REVISED: I'm going to ask you some questions. Anything you say
REVISED: may be held against you in a court of law. Do you
REVISED: understand?
REVISED: Yes. Of course.
REVISED: TRUMAN'S VOICE
REVISED: On Friday morning, March third, did you go to
REVISED: Calhoun Memorial Hospital?
REVISED: Leland answers quietly, intent, as if commenting on the actions of someone else.
REVISED: Yes
REVISED: TRUMAN'S VOICE
REVISED: Why did you go there?
REVISED: I was looking for someone.
REVISED: TRUMAN'S VOICE
REVISED: Who were you looking for?
REVISED: The man who killed my daughter.
REVISED: TRUMAN'S VOICE
REVISED: Did you know his name?
REVISED: #2.004
REVISED: 1. CONTINUED:
REVISED: No. Yes. I do now. Jacques Renault.
REVISED: What made you think he killed Laura?
REVISED: You arrested him.
REVISED: Leland ... did you kill Jacques Renault?
REVISED: He killed my Laura. The things he did to her... have
REVISED: you ever experienced ... absolute loss?
REVISED: I doubt any of us is a stranger to grief.
REVISED: It's more than grief. So deep inside you, every cell
REVISED: screams. You hear nothing else.
REVISED: Yes I killed him. Yes, Yes, Yes ...
REVISED: Leland Palmer breaks down and cries. Truman, Cooper, and DOC HAYWARD arrayed
REVISED: about the weeping man. HOLD ON this tableau for a beat.
REVISED: 2. INT. SHERIFF'S STATION HALLWAY - DAY
REVISED: Cooper and Doc Hayward exit interrogation and walk down a station hallway.
REVISED: He'll plead temporary insanity.
REVISED: We'll need a psychiatric exam. I can tell you this.
REVISED: Parents should not bury their children. Anyone who's
REVISED: suffered what Leland has ...
REVISED: #2.004
REVISED: 2. CONTINUED:
REVISED: Do you approve of murder, Doctor Hayward?
REVISED: No.
REVISED: But in this case, his tone suggests, he's considered the exception.
REVISED: 3. INT. SHERIFF'S RECEPTION AREA - DAY
REVISED: DEPUTY ANDY BRENNAN fidgets in the reception area. Tries hard not to look like he's
REVISED: waiting for someone. When Doc Hayward and Cooper enter, Andy nearly shouts.
REVISED: Hey Doc!
REVISED: How are you, Andy?
REVISED: Fine. Great. Fine.
REVISED: Andy's smile is false. A beat.
REVISED: What the problem?
REVISED: It's sort of personal.
REVISED: I'm your doctor, Andy.
REVISED: Andy hesitates. This is quite difficult for him. At last, almost in a whisper.
REVISED: It's about my sperms test.
REVISED: Yes ...?
REVISED: You know ... I flunked.
REVISED: #2.004
REVISED: 3. CONTINUED:
REVISED: That's not the precise term for it ...
REVISED: Well I was just wonderin' if it's the kind of test you can
REVISED: take over, you know, like a driver's exam? I mean I've
REVISED: been wearing boxer shorts every day like you told me -
REVISED: You'd like to give it another shot.
REVISED: Yes sir I would.
REVISED: Well then I'll need a sample to take with me.
REVISED: Hayward sifts through his Gladstone, hands Andy a small sample jar. Andy pales.
REVISED: Right now?
REVISED: Put it in a brown paper bag. I'll wait in the car.
REVISED: Doc exits. Andy glances wildly about the reception room. No one's looking. He spots the
REVISED: box full of "FLESH WORLD" magazines.
REVISED: 4. INT. SHERIFF'S STATION HALLWAY - DAY
REVISED: Coming around a corner, Andy and LUCY MORAN nearly collide. She's lugging a
REVISED: coffeemaker. He's toting a couple of FLESH WORLDS, which he promptly drops. Lucy
REVISED: spots the pornography, then peers over Andy's shoulder, his destination beyond. The MEN'S
REVISED: ROOM. Lucy shakes her head sadly and storms off Andy watches her vanish with a wince.
REVISED: 5. INT. RECEPTION - DAY
REVISED: Truman and Cooper sit in reception with coffee, taking a breather. Cooper cases himself into
REVISED: a chair with a grimace, as Truman runs down the day's business.
REVISED: #2.004
REVISED: 5. CONTINUED:
REVISED: Our judge is scheduled to arrive this afternoon. Clinton
REVISED: Sternwood. Travels the circuit in a Winnebago.
REVISED: Outdoors enthusiast?
REVISED: Last of the frontiersmen. They broke the mold.
REVISED: Bail hearing for Leland. Leo's competency examination.
REVISED: That's the agenda. Does Leland get bail?
REVISED: That's up to your state prosecutor.
REVISED: Daryl Lodwick. Also on his way.
REVISED: What do we hear from Hawk?
REVISED: Called this morning. County says nobody by the name
REVISED: of 'Robertson' ever lived next to the Palmers. Got a
REVISED: forwarding address on the last occupants; Kalispell.
REVISED: He'll check it by afternoon.
REVISED: That's it.
REVISED: Cooper sips his coffee.
REVISED: 5A. INT. HALLWAY - DAY
REVISED: Andy exits the bathroom, holding a small paper bag. He hurries around the corner, bumps
REVISED: into a coatrack and drops the bag. The bag opens and the sample rolls away down the hall,
REVISED: coming to rest under a chair in reception. Andy hurries after it, diving past Cooper and
REVISED: Truman to retrieve it. Cooper sees the bottom of Andy's new boots.
REVISED: Andy, don't move -
REVISED: Andy, where did you get those?
REVISED: Revised 8-13-90, BLUE
REVISED: #2.004
REVISED: 5A. CONTINUED:
REVISED: Don't make me say where they came from.
REVISED: Andy -
REVISED: Please, Agent Cooper, this is extremely personal
REVISED: business.
REVISED: Your shoes.
REVISED: Oh. I'm sorry. Phillip Gerard sold 'em to me
REVISED: yesterday when he was waiting. Sorry.
REVISED: These are the same brand of shoe we found at Leo
REVISED: Johnson's. The giant said There was a clue out there.
REVISED: I thought it was cocaine.
REVISED: Harry, we've got to find Phillip Gerard.
REVISED: Can I go now? Agent Cooper, I don't know how much
REVISED: time I've got.
REVISED: 6. EXT. GREAT NORTHERN HOTEL - DAY
REVISED: 7. INT. GREAT NORTHERN HOTEL LOBBY - DAY
REVISED: BEN HORNE steps through the lobby. A DESK CLERK appears at his side.
REVISED: Mr. Horne?
REVISED: Revised 8-13-90, BLUE
REVISED: 6A.
REVISED: #2.004
REVISED: 7. CONTINUED:
REVISED: Walk with me and talk.
REVISED: Okay, so this friend of mine works for the Seattle Post
REVISED: Dispatch, actually my sister went to college with her,
REVISED: but she's kind of a friend of mine too. Anyway she
REVISED: called me this morning with a hot tip. Top secret.
REVISED: M.T. Wentz is coming to Twin Peaks.
REVISED: M.T. Wentz ... M.T. Wentz ...
REVISED: #2.004
REVISED: 7. CONTINUED:
REVISED: M.T. Wentz, the travel writer -
REVISED: Yes. M.T. Wentz. The travel writer.
REVISED: Wentz travels incognito, using only cash. No credit
REVISED: cards, no way to trace his identity. Or hers. No one at
REVISED: the paper even knows who he or she is.
REVISED: A favorable Wentz review can spell big business.
REVISED: He's coming, he's coming he's coming -
REVISED: Keep an eye on registration. I want hourly updates.
REVISED: Scrutinize every check-in -
REVISED: Especially if they pay cash.
REVISED: It's not even nine thirty and you've already done a good
REVISED: day's work.
REVISED: Ben turns on his heels, walks away without another word.
REVISED: 8. INT. BEN HORNE'S OFFICE - DAY
REVISED: Ben enters his office, stops short. JEAN RENAULT sits on his desk, beside a portable
REVISED: television set, complete with built-in video cassette player.
REVISED: Mr. Horne. You look well.
REVISED: What can I do for you?
REVISED: #2.004
REVISED: 8. CONTINUED:
REVISED: We've met. I sell 'insurance' to small businesses. Like
REVISED: One-Eyed Jack's.
REVISED: The mention catches Ben's attention. He closes the door behind him. Steps closer.
REVISED: Jean Renault. What's the occasion? Are my premiums
REVISED: about to be raised?
REVISED: Renault produces a video tape, inserts it into the television. Presses PLAY. Ben stops
REVISED: suddenly, pales: Audrey appears on screen, drugged, incoherent. Her wrists visibly bound.
REVISED: You bastard.
REVISED: Don't make a mistake, Mr. Horne. I'm just the
REVISED: messenger.
REVISED: For whom?
REVISED: Renault shakes his index finger. He will dictate the terms of their discussion from this point
REVISED: on. Renault FREEZE-FRAMES Audrey's image, continues:
REVISED: There are terms. Would you like to hear them?
REVISED: Yes.
REVISED: They request a large sum of money -
REVISED: How much?
REVISED: I require something else, entirely.
REVISED: They should bear the cost of their own middleman -
REVISED: They can't give me what I want. Would you like to hear
REVISED: what I want?
REVISED: #2.004
REVISED: 8. CONTINUED:
REVISED: Yes.
REVISED: Number one your business up there is run by pickpockets
REVISED: and fools. Every dollar earned, there's a dollar stolen.
REVISED: Are you aware of that?
REVISED: I have my suspicions.
REVISED: What you need is a partner. Who could take care of your
REVISED: little problem.
REVISED: I already have a partner.
REVISED: Okay. Do you want my help or not?
REVISED: Yes. Yes.
REVISED: One more thing.
REVISED: Renault presses FAST-FORWARD on his remote. He stops the tape at a familiar image:
REVISED: Cooper in tuxedo, seated at one of the casino's blackjack tables. Ben reacts to Cooper's image
REVISED: with surprise, trepidation. What's Cooper doing in his casino?
REVISED: I want this man to deliver the ransom.
REVISED: Why? That man's a Federal agent.
REVISED: Do you want your daughter back?
REVISED: Of course, but I can't involve -
REVISED: Cash. Partners. FBI man.
REVISED: #2.004
REVISED: 8. CONTINUED:
REVISED: That's supposed be an equitable exchange?
REVISED: Jean smiles. He can't help but appreciate Ben's venality under pressure.
REVISED: This could turn out well. I'll leave the video. It could
REVISED: help clarify your thinking. Expect a call tomorrow.
REVISED: Noon.
REVISED: He exits. A long beat. And Ben steps to his desk, picks up the the phone, punches a button:
REVISED: Janet, find Agent Cooper for me, please. It's urgent.
REVISED: Revised; 8-13-90, BLUE
REVISED: #2.004
REVISED: 9. INT. THE DOUBLE R DINER - DAY
REVISED: HANK JENNINGS carries two covered Meals On Wheels trays from kitchen to counter.
REVISED: DONNA HAYWARD waits to receive them.
REVISED: You're looking real pretty today, Donna.
REVISED: Thanks.
REVISED: Special occasion?
REVISED: Lunch with ... someone I met on my route.
REVISED: Bed pans and shut-ins. Who's to meet?
REVISED: You wouldn't understand.
REVISED: Donna reacts to the slight with muted anger. As if to defend the absent Harold Smith. She
REVISED: grabs the trays, heads for the door. HANK eyes her figure as she exits. NORMA JENNINGS
REVISED: hurries into view, interrupts his reverie:
REVISED: Hank, listen to this: Louie called from the Northern.
REVISED: M.T. Wentz is coming to Twin Peaks.
REVISED: Empty who?
REVISED: Only the most powerful restaurant critic in the state. A
REVISED: good review in a Seattle paper could mean a lot of
REVISED: business. He's going to try and send him our way.
REVISED: What's he look like?
REVISED: #2.004
REVISED: 9. CONTINUED:
REVISED: Nobody knows. It's a secret I guess. But he thinks he's
REVISED: arriving today.
REVISED: Then we've still got time.
REVISED: For what?
REVISED: I'll pick up some flowers, maybe some candles and
REVISED: tableclothes - now what could we put on the menu, some
REVISED: specials maybe -
REVISED: I've always wanted to do some regional dishes -
REVISED: Babe, we're gonna trick this joint out like Christmas in
REVISED: July.
REVISED: Hank grabs some cash from the register, gives Norma a kiss, steps toward the door. Norma
REVISED: smiles, moved by his boyish enthusiasm. It's the man with whom she fell in love.
REVISED: Oh, and I think you ought to give Big Ed a call.
REVISED: Why?
REVISED: You're still friendly, right? So maybe this Wentz fella
REVISED: stops in for gas, suggest the Double R to any
REVISED: new faces he sees.
REVISED: I'll call him.
REVISED: #2.004
REVISED: Good. You do that.
REVISED: For just an instant, almost imperceptibly, a chill passes through Hank's voice. Norma and Big
REVISED: Ed. Hank leavens the latter with a smile, turns and steps out the door.
REVISED: 10. INT. HAROLD SMITH'S APARTMENT DAY
REVISED: HAROLD SMITH carefully sets Donna's trays atop a blanket before her. He's turned his
REVISED: living room into an indoor picnic; silverware and plates, he's even produced a wicker basket.
REVISED: Donna watches, impressed.
REVISED: How many agoraphobics do you know who own a picnic
REVISED: basket?
REVISED: Not too many, I guess.
REVISED: Smith sits across from her, cross-legged, with a smile.
REVISED: The food looks delicious. Thank you.
REVISED: I wanted it to be special.
REVISED: It is. Very. What am I thinking? We should have wine.
REVISED: Smith leaps up, energized, he steps toward a door, opens it to reveal a wine rack inside.
REVISED: Any requests?
REVISED: Don't ask me. All the boys I know drink beer.
REVISED: I'll select something appropriate. The Germans
REVISED: practically invented picnic wine. Sprechen Sie Deutsch?
REVISED: Parlez vous Francais?
REVISED: #2.004
REVISED: Of course; you speak a Romance language.
REVISED: Smith opens the wine with subtle ceremony, pours a little into a glass for Donna to sample.
REVISED: She looks at him, wonders. He nods, prompts. Donna takes a little sip.
REVISED: Wow.
REVISED: It's very good. Thanks.
REVISED: Smith smiles, pours the rest. He holds up his glass.
REVISED: What shall we drink to?
REVISED: To Laura.
REVISED: To Laura. In our hearts and memories.
REVISED: They touch glasses. A spark passes between them. Smith reaches toward an end table, grasps
REVISED: Laura's diary. The one Donna spotted there previously. Donna reacts. Smith looks at her; can
REVISED: see the eager curiosity in her eyes.
REVISED: Her diary. Did I tell you I had this?
REVISED: Laura's diary?
REVISED: Would you like me to read? It seems appropriate.
REVISED: Please.
REVISED: Smith turns through the diary, selects a page. He begins.
REVISED: "But still I'm afraid to tell her of my fantasies and my
REVISED: nightmares; sometimes she's good at understanding,
REVISED: other times she just giggles, and I don't have the nerve to
REVISED: ask why things like that are funny to her."
REVISED: #2.004
REVISED: 10. CONTINUED:
REVISED: Donna reacts. She knows exactly to whom Laura is referring. Smith continues:
REVISED: "So I feel badly again and shut up about it for a long
REVISED: time. I love Donna very much, but sometimes I worry
REVISED: that she wouldn't be around me at tall if she knew what
REVISED: my insides were like. Black and dark, and soaked with
REVISED: dreams of big, big men and different ways they might
REVISED: hold me and take me into their control ..."
REVISED: Smith reads the latter without emotion, an even odder twist to Laura's musing. Donna
REVISED: reacts, saddened, embarrassed somehow. She wants Smith to stop and he can see it.
REVISED: Is something wrong?
REVISED: I'm just thinking, I mean, isn't that evidence? Shouldn't
REVISED: we give it to Sheriff Truman?
REVISED: No.
REVISED: I've read this from cover to cover, Donna. There are no
REVISED: solutions here. Besides, she gave it it to me.
REVISED: Why?
REVISED: Safekeeping. Laura knew about my work.
REVISED: I don't know anything about it.
REVISED: No. You don't.
REVISED: I'm a collector.
REVISED: Smith rises, steps to a bookshelf.
REVISED: Of what?
REVISED: #2.004
REVISED: 10. CONTINUED:
REVISED: Lives. People come to me and tell me their stories.
REVISED: About the world outside. I take their stories and place
REVISED: them in a ... larger context. A sort of living novel.
REVISED: Who tells you?
REVISED: Friends. Lovers
REVISED: Maybe you will too, someday
REVISED: Donna shivers. With a quiet thrill, some anticipation. And just a sliver of fear.
REVISED: 11. INT. BEN HORNE'S OFFICE - DAY
REVISED: Cooper and Horne look at the small television/VCR on the desktop.
REVISED: You were right. Her kidnappers contacted me this
REVISED: morning. Damn me, but you were right.
REVISED: I'll call the sheriff -
REVISED: God no. They'll kill her at the first sign of police
REVISED: involvement. That's why I called you.
REVISED: That's no reason to circumvent normal channels.
REVISED: Normal channels won't bring my daughter back alive.
REVISED: #2.004
REVISED: 11. CONTINUED:
REVISED: Ben turns to the small television, presses PLAY. Audrey's image appears on the screen.
REVISED: Cooper stares at the screen with evident emotion. Ben's got him right where he wants him.
REVISED: You and Audrey have a special relationship. You of all
REVISED: people understand her value to me. They want to make
REVISED: the exchange tomorrow. Audrey for one hundred and
REVISED: twenty-five thousands dollars. Cash. But I must ask you;
REVISED: will you take it there.
REVISED: HOLD ON Cooper for a beat. Starring at Audrey, helpless on the video screen.
REVISED: 12. EXT. THE BLUE PINE LODGE - DAY
REVISED: 13. THE BLUE PINE LODGE - DAY
REVISED: START ON the kitchen door. Someone turns the knob, kicks it open. A figure steps inside,
REVISED: face hidden by the absurd number of shopping bags, hatboxes, etc. that they are carrying.
REVISED: ANOTHER ANGLE reveals s JOSIE PACKARD behind the boxes and bags. She sets the
REVISED: loot down or the kitchen table. PETE MARTEL enters, sees her.
REVISED: Josie.
REVISED: They enter into a warm embrace.
REVISED: Oh, Pete. I'm so sorry.
REVISED: Me too.
REVISED: I keep thinking about Andrew. What he would have
REVISED: done about the fire. Thank goodness Catherine was here
REVISED: to handle everything.
REVISED: Pete's face falls. She doesn't know. Josie sees it.
REVISED: What is it?
REVISED: Revised 8-13-90 BLUE
REVISED: #2.004
REVISED: 13. CONTINUED:
REVISED: Josie, Catherine died in the fire.
REVISED: Oh my God.
REVISED: We're planning a service. They haven't found the body ...
REVISED: Pete cannot continue. Josie pulls him back into their embrace. This time to heal. Or perhaps
REVISED: to hide her own delight at Catherine's passing.
REVISED: Oh, Pete.
REVISED: In a couple days, we'll go ahead. I don't know exactly
REVISED: what we'll bury.
REVISED: I feel so guilty. Shopping in Seattle. Everyone must
REVISED: have been wondering -
REVISED: Harry'd sure liked to hear from you, I know that.
REVISED: Yes. I'll call him.
REVISED: And you got a strange message on the phone yesterday.
REVISED: Man talked real quiet. Wouldn't give his name.
REVISED: Did you write it down?
REVISED: Didn't have to. It was so strange I remembered it. "In
REVISED: 1997 Hong Kong will be returned to the mainland."
REVISED: What the heck do you suppose that was about?
REVISED: I'm sure I don't know.
REVISED: #2.004
REVISED: 14. INT. ONE-EYED JACK'S OFFICE - DAY
REVISED: EMORY BATTIS roughly escorts Audrey into Blackie's office. Jean Renault sits at her desk.
REVISED: Audrey tries to focus, look at the man before her. But she's weak, barely coherent.
REVISED: C'mon, Dreamboat, daddy's waiting.
REVISED: Emory shoves her down into a chair. Renault reacts with a frown.
REVISED: Miss Home has been a very bad girl. Refusing to take
REVISED: her medicine.
REVISED: No more. Please.
REVISED: Battis scoffs. But Renault surprises him.
REVISED: Audrey, have you been mistreated?
REVISED: Battis reacts. What the hell is this? Audrey pauses, then looks hard at Battis.
REVISED: He hit me.
REVISED: I did not hit her. If that's what you're thinking. I didn't.
REVISED: That was wrong. It will never happen again. For as long
REVISED: as you are with me. Do you understand?
REVISED: I spoke to your father this morning. You're in no danger.
REVISED: Everything's going to be fine. You do trust me, don't
REVISED: you Audrey?
REVISED: Renault's voice is hypnotically soothing. His concern seems genuine. Audrey feels safe
REVISED: somehow. Battis steps back to Audrey, sits in a chair beside her. As if to rejoin the team.
REVISED: You see, Audrey, in a situation like this, people have to
REVISED: handle themselves in a professional manner. We're all
REVISED: reasonable people. Something reasonable can be worked
REVISED: out whenever reasonable people put their minds to it -
REVISED: #2.004
REVISED: 14. CONTINUED:
REVISED: Renault casually pulls out a silenced .38 and shoots Battis three times. A beat. Battis, quite
REVISED: dead, and his chair, fall over backwards. Audrey recoils in horror. Renault holds her.
REVISED: There, there. There, there.
REVISED: HOLD ON Audrey for a beat. The nightmare begins again.

FADE TO BLACK: 15. INT. HAYWARD HOUSE - DAY
FADE TO BLACK: DOC HAYWARD sits on the sofa, on the phone, refers to some notes he's taken.
FADE TO BLACK: Ed, I just talked with the Saeger-Swenson Clinic in
FADE TO BLACK: Seattle. Nadine's problems might be related to
FADE TO BLACK: something called pheochromo crytoma; effects the
FADE TO BLACK: adrenal gland, it could account for her strength and, uh,
FADE TO BLACK: erratic behavior. I'll let you know.
FADE TO BLACK: As Doc is hanging up Donna a defiant descent of the stairs, hoping her father will notice
FADE TO BLACK: her. Takes out a cigarette and lights it.
FADE TO BLACK: I'd like to talk to you, Donna.
FADE TO BLACK: I gotta go.
FADE TO BLACK: Meeting James?
FADE TO BLACK: Writing a book?
FADE TO BLACK: Hayward points to a chair and Donna begrudgingly sits.
FADE TO BLACK: You missed two days of school last week. Without an
FADE TO BLACK: excuse.
FADE TO BLACK: I had ... I was busy.
FADE TO BLACK: Donna, we've always been able to talk. If there's
FADE TO BLACK: something going on you'd like to share with -
FADE TO BLACK: There's nothing going on -
FADE TO BLACK: I have to reluctantly admit I don't believe you - and
FADE TO BLACK: there've been other things as well, both your mother and
FADE TO BLACK: I are concerned -
FADE TO BLACK: #2.004
FADE TO BLACK: 15. CONTINUED:
FADE TO BLACK: I don't know. Since Laura died everything's different -
FADE TO BLACK: You may feel that it is but -
FADE TO BLACK: Dad, I'm sorry, I can't talk about this right now -
FADE TO BLACK: I think it's very important that. we talk about it -
FADE TO BLACK: It doesn't have anything to do with you -
FADE TO BLACK: Donna, don't shut us out of your life -
FADE TO BLACK: I have to, I'm sorry -
FADE TO BLACK: Donna -
FADE TO BLACK: Donna puts her cigarette out and leaves. Pause. Doc empties the ashtray into a waste basket.
FADE TO BLACK: 16. INT. RECEPTION AREA - DAY
FADE TO BLACK: Lucy is making coffee when Andy comes in. She gives him no focus. Cooper enters the
FADE TO BLACK: station behind them.
FADE TO BLACK: Lucy?
FADE TO BLACK: Lucy, we need to talk -
FADE TO BLACK: I thought you preferred the company of your
FADE TO BLACK: MAGAZINES!
FADE TO BLACK: Andy cowers. Her raised voice brings Truman out of the CONFERENCE ROOM. Lucy
FADE TO BLACK: slams coffee paraphenalia around.
FADE TO BLACK: #2.004
FADE TO BLACK: 16. CONTINUED:
FADE TO BLACK: Andy, maybe you'd like to get some air.
FADE TO BLACK: Andy obediently steps outside.
FADE TO BLACK: Lucy, I think we're at the point where it would be
FADE TO BLACK: healthier for everyone if you got whatever was eating you
FADE TO BLACK: out in the open.
FADE TO BLACK: Andy and I used to go out.
FADE TO BLACK: That much I've gathered.
FADE TO BLACK: For a year and a half until I began to notice things about
FADE TO BLACK: him. They weren't big things. They were little things.
FADE TO BLACK: He never exercises. He never washes his car, and he
FADE TO BLACK: doesn't own a sports coat.
FADE TO BLACK: Uh-huh, and did you do something about this?
FADE TO BLACK: After watching a television show, I decided I needed
FADE TO BLACK: some "me" time, during which we didn't see each other,
FADE TO BLACK: during which period I met Dick Tremayne, Horne's
FADE TO BLACK: Department Store, Men's Fashions. He had many coats
FADE TO BLACK: and keeps himself and his car in good shape. Most of
FADE TO BLACK: his behavior was asinine, but at least he was different.
FADE TO BLACK: Are you still seeing this Dick?
FADE TO BLACK: No.
FADE TO BLACK: Do you want to get back with Andy?
FADE TO BLACK: I don't know.
FADE TO BLACK: Well, then Lucy, what exactly do you want?
FADE TO BLACK: Revised 8-13-90, BLUE
FADE TO BLACK: #2.004
FADE TO BLACK: 16. CONTINUED:
FADE TO BLACK: I don't know!
FADE TO BLACK: Lucy ends in loud, protracted tears and wanders off. Cooper is completely stumped. Shrugs
FADE TO BLACK: to Truman. Truman shakes his head.
FADE TO BLACK: I was trying to help.
FADE TO BLACK: It's a nice thought. But it's like trying to fix the potholes
FADE TO BLACK: on Highway 9. One heavy rain ...
FADE TO BLACK: I see. You've been down this road before.
FADE TO BLACK: Truman nods. Cooper remembers something, checks the hallway for privacy.
FADE TO BLACK: Harry, I've got a dangerous situation. I've examined it
FADE TO BLACK: from every possible angle. Front to back, top to
FADE TO BLACK: bottom. And I believe there is only one way to proceed.
FADE TO BLACK: I'm asking a favor. Strictly between us.
FADE TO BLACK: What's up?
FADE TO BLACK: I need one of the Bookhouse Boys. Your best man. It
FADE TO BLACK: would be better if you didn't know why.
FADE TO BLACK: I've stayed clear when you asked me to and helped when
FADE TO BLACK: you needed it. But Coop, I've got to put my oar in here.
FADE TO BLACK: What do you mean?
FADE TO BLACK: You're not getting a little too personal with your work,
FADE TO BLACK: are you?
FADE TO BLACK: #2.004

FADE TO BLACK: Harry S. Truman, you're a citizen.
FADE TO BLACK: 17. INT. DOUBLE R DINER - NIGHT
FADE TO BLACK: Norma and Hank are putting finishing touches on a cosmetic overhaul; tablecloths, candles
FADE TO BLACK: and flowers in every booth. Hank wears a starched shirt. A nondescript, portly MAN appears
FADE TO BLACK: at the diner door, briefcase in hand. Norma calls Hank attention to him.
FADE TO BLACK: Could be.
FADE TO BLACK: Here we go.
FADE TO BLACK: #2.004
FADE TO BLACK: 17. CONTINUED:
FADE TO BLACK: Norma moves to him.
FADE TO BLACK: Good evening, sir, welcome to the Double R.
FADE TO BLACK: Thanks. Could I get a booth?
FADE TO BLACK: Right this way, please.
FADE TO BLACK: She leads him to a booth, he settles in, she hands him a menu.
FADE TO BLACK: I'll be back to tell you about the specials.
FADE TO BLACK: No need. I want a cheeseburger, medium, a coke and
FADE TO BLACK: some fries.
FADE TO BLACK: Very good.
FADE TO BLACK: The Man's back is to a PORTLY CUSTOMER in the booth behind him, sloppily and noisily
FADE TO BLACK: hoovering a hamburger, using his shirt for a napkin. Hank causally strolls past the Man, picks
FADE TO BLACK: up the Portly Customer's plate and takes him by the arm towards the kitchen.
FADE TO BLACK: Why don't we finish up in the kitchen.
FADE TO BLACK: Hank ushers him into the kitchen. OFF CAMERA a number of pots and pans crash. Hank
FADE TO BLACK: reemerges, meets Norma behind the counter, as Norma puts the order on the service wheel.
FADE TO BLACK: All he wanted was a cheeseburger.
FADE TO BLACK: Must be some sort of food critic trick.
FADE TO BLACK: The Man gets up and comes towards Hank and Norma. They smile nervously.
FADE TO BLACK: Bathroom?
FADE TO BLACK: Right this way, sir.

FADE TO BLACK: 17. CONTINUED:
FADE TO BLACK: Hank shows him to the bathroom. On his way back, Hank straightens out some of the little
FADE TO BLACK: bouquets in each of the booths making his way to the "critic's" booth. The Man has left his
FADE TO BLACK: sports coat on the seat. Hank reaches in and TAKES OUT A WALLET.
FADE TO BLACK: 18. MADDY IN A BOOTH
FADE TO BLACK: Maddy sits and eyes the door. She's nervous. Donna enters, steps toward her. There is much
FADE TO BLACK: tension between them.
FADE TO BLACK: Hi.
FADE TO BLACK: Thanks for coming. I didn't know ...
FADE TO BLACK: Know what?
FADE TO BLACK: I didn't know if you were mad or not. How mad.
FADE TO BLACK: I'll survive.
FADE TO BLACK: Donna lights a cigarette. Maddy pauses. She's not used to Donna's tough-girl poses.
FADE TO BLACK: Donna, there's going on between me and James.
FADE TO BLACK: What if there is? I mean who said James and I couldn't
FADE TO BLACK: see other people? I certainly didn't.
FADE TO BLACK: Are you saying you're seeing someone?
FADE TO BLACK: Donna pauses to exhale a little smoke. She eyes Maddy for a moment. Then:
FADE TO BLACK: Maddy, I need your help.
FADE TO BLACK: How?
FADE TO BLACK: Harold Smith has Laura's diary.

FADE TO BLACK: 18. CONTINUED:
FADE TO BLACK: But I thought the Sheriff has Laura's diary.
FADE TO BLACK: Harold says Laura had a second diary she never told me
FADE TO BLACK: about and he's got it.
FADE TO BLACK: God. We should tell James about this.
FADE TO BLACK: This has nothing to do with James,.
FADE TO BLACK: But he's been a part of this all along -

FADE TO BLACK: 18. CONTINUED:
FADE TO BLACK: If Laura did have a secret diary and he's got it, I'm
FADE TO BLACK: going to get it. With or without your help.
FADE TO BLACK: Donna rises, exits without another word. Maddy sighs, watches her go. Donna steps past
FADE TO BLACK: Hank, behind the counter. He seizes a quiet moment to open the wallet. An identification
FADE TO BLACK: card inside reads:
FADE TO BLACK: Hank reacts; disappointment and opportunity.
FADE TO BLACK: 19. OMITTED
FADE TO BLACK: 20. INT. BLUE PINE LODGE - NIGHT
FADE TO BLACK: Josie models a new negligee. Truman sits stoically.
FADE TO BLACK: I know I paid too much for it, but I fell in love with
FADE TO BLACK: it ... I heard the salesman say, "The only reason we're still
FADE TO BLACK: in business is because Josie Packard buys retail."
FADE TO BLACK: It's nice.
FADE TO BLACK: Josie kisses him. Truman doesn't respond. She feels his check and then his hands.
FADE TO BLACK: You're so cold.
FADE TO BLACK: Josie, I have to ask you this ... were you really in Seattle?
FADE TO BLACK: Yes. Why are you so suspicious? Look at these boxes,
FADE TO BLACK: you think I got these at the Cash and Carry?
FADE TO BLACK: Besides, you know I had to get away. I was afraid.
FADE TO BLACK: Afraid of Catherine.
FADE TO BLACK: #2.004
FADE TO BLACK: 20. CONTINUED:
FADE TO BLACK: You know why.
FADE TO BLACK: And now Catherine is dead.
FADE TO BLACK: She looks at him. Startled, almost amused.
FADE TO BLACK: Harry, you don't think I ...
FADE TO BLACK: I don't know what I think.
FADE TO BLACK: You think that I could bum the mill? That I would
FADE TO BLACK: deliberately ruin everything of mine?
FADE TO BLACK: There's insurance money.
FADE TO BLACK: Pause.
FADE TO BLACK: My God ... how could you? How could you think such
FADE TO BLACK: terrible things?. How could you hurt me so?
FADE TO BLACK: She turns away. Weeps quietly. Truman melts.
FADE TO BLACK: Josie ... Josie?
FADE TO BLACK: She turns back. He holds her. It complicates into a kiss, then passion.
FADE TO BLACK: I want you... I want you to take me.
FADE TO BLACK: They kiss again. Truman starts to lose himself.
FADE TO BLACK: Josie ...
FADE TO BLACK: Tear it. Tear it.
FADE TO BLACK: She bites his neck. He rips the back of her negligee. She gasps, trembling. He grabs her
FADE TO BLACK: violently by the shoulders.
FADE TO BLACK: #2.004
FADE TO BLACK: 20. CONTINUED:
FADE TO BLACK: What do I mean to you?
FADE TO BLACK: I love you. I need you.
FADE TO BLACK: Don't play with me.
FADE TO BLACK: I want you.
FADE TO BLACK: She proves it. Truman slowly loses to his passion.
FADE TO BLACK: I want you ... more than my own life.
FADE TO BLACK: They kiss, without control. They roll over and over again until they are below a draped
FADE TO BLACK: window. The CAMERA MOVES UP the drapes. Behind the blinds in the kitchen, watching
FADE TO BLACK: and enjoying is Jonathan, the Asian Man.

FADE OUT: Say good lookin', who do you have to grease to get a
FADE OUT: cup of coffee around here?
FADE OUT: Judge Sternwood, hello Your Honor.
FADE OUT: Lucy, you're a cool drink of water to road-weary eyes.
FADE OUT: What is your secret?
FADE OUT: I'd rather not talk about it sir.
FADE OUT: Give us a hug.
FADE OUT: Life is hard, dear.
FADE OUT: Still and all, harder in most places than Twin Peaks.
FADE OUT: Truman enters the station.
FADE OUT: Clinton, sorry I'm late -
FADE OUT: I've only just arrived. What's her name, Harry?
FADE OUT: What?
FADE OUT: #2.004
FADE OUT: 22. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: You've got the look of a man with filly trouble, son. If
FADE OUT: she won't take the saddle you've got two options. I
FADE OUT: won't bore you with either one of 'em -
FADE OUT: Cooper enters from Truman's office.
FADE OUT: Judge Clinton Sternwood, this is Dale Cooper, FBI.
FADE OUT: Your Honor.
FADE OUT: How are you, lad?
FADE OUT: You two should have a lot in common.
FADE OUT: Lucy hands Sternwood a coffee.
FADE OUT: Thank you, dear. Harry, break the seal on that bottle of
FADE OUT: Irish you've got stashed for me and let's put our feet up.
FADE OUT: Sid'll bring in the calender soon as the Winnebago's
FADE OUT: tanked up.
FADE OUT: Mr. Cooper, how do you find our little corner of the
FADE OUT: world?
FADE OUT: Heaven, sir.
FADE OUT: This week heaven includes arson, multiple homicides
FADE OUT: and an attempt on the life of a federal agent.
FADE OUT: Heaven's a large and interesting place.
FADE OUT: Let's hope so, son. Harry, where's that bottle?
FADE OUT: They're inside. We stay with LUCY, as she returns to her post. The door opens, RICHARD
FADE OUT: TREYMAYNE enters, raincoated, romantic and rushed.

FADE OUT: Lucy ...
FADE OUT: Dick?
FADE OUT: Lucy, I haven't slept, I can't eat, I've been absolutely
FADE OUT: miserable
FADE OUT: You have?
FADE OUT: I've been a fool, a cad, the way I've behaved. I am
FADE OUT: deeply, deeply ashamed.
FADE OUT: You are?
FADE OUT: I must have been over it in my mind a million times and
FADE OUT: what I've come to is this: I have to, no, I must ... do the
FADE OUT: right thing.
FADE OUT: You must?
FADE OUT: It's everything I could scrape together, dear. I am
FADE OUT: completely knackered.
FADE OUT: Lucy looks in the envelope. Cash.
FADE OUT: What is this?
FADE OUT: Six hundred and fifty. I, uh, called around. I'm told
FADE OUT: this should be more than adequate.
FADE OUT: For what?

FADE OUT: ... little problem.
FADE OUT: Richard, here's what you're going to do ...
FADE OUT: Take your money, put it back in your pocket or your
FADE OUT: wallet, turn right, step through both sets of doors, the
FADE OUT: second ones stick sometimes, go out to the parking lot,
FADE OUT: get into your car, turn the key - AND NEVER SPEAK
FADE OUT: TO ME AGAIN FOR AS LONG AS YOU LIVE.
FADE OUT: Say one more word I'm going to scream. Leave, please.
FADE OUT: I -
FADE OUT: She fiercely puts her fingers to her lips and closes her eyes. He slinks out. She goes into
FADE OUT: Truman's office and closes the door, from where we can hear muffled sobs. Moments later,
FADE OUT: Andy appears in the corridor, leading a handcuffed Leland. They pass by the office. Andy
FADE OUT: hears Lucy. They proceed to the conference room.
FADE OUT: 23. INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT
FADE OUT: Truman, Cooper and Sternwood, as Andy enters with Leland.
FADE OUT: Judge Sternwood.
FADE OUT: Leland ... take those cuffs off him please, Deputy ...
FADE OUT: Leland, this is most difficult. My deepest condolances
FADE OUT: for your heartbreaking loss.
FADE OUT: Thank you, sir.
FADE OUT: You've appeared before me many times. I know you to
FADE OUT: be a fine and decent man and a capable attorney. To see
FADE OUT: you under these circumstances is dreadful for us all. The
FADE OUT: law provides a structure to guide us through perilous and
FADE OUT: trying times; but it requires our submission to its

FADE OUT: 26. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: Peter, this is my cousin, Jonathan.
FADE OUT: Pleasure to meet you, Jonathan.
FADE OUT: Thank you, Mr. Pete. Josie has told so much about you.
FADE OUT: So you've come over to visit us from Hong Kong.
FADE OUT: Yes. Hong Kong.
FADE OUT: Josie tells me you run the best little fish market in town.
FADE OUT: I don't know. Very competitive.
FADE OUT: I'm afraid cousin is in need of some good old American
FADE OUT: how-now.
FADE OUT: That's know-how, all you need, Jon, is a good contact
FADE OUT: here can air cargo you some King salmon, fresh, daily.
FADE OUT: Run those other rascals right out of business.
FADE OUT: Jonathan laughs, smiles shyly, toes the carpet.
FADE OUT: Pete, could cousin have some joe? After his long flight
FADE OUT: it will help him reset his biographical clock.
FADE OUT: Biological. Cup 'a joe, coming right up.
FADE OUT: Pete exits. Jonathan drops the act. His voice is lower; accent Brtisih, clipped, urbane.
FADE OUT: I don't know how you've lasted six years. Nothing but
FADE OUT: hayseeds and manual laborers.

FADE OUT: 26. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: We all have our job to do.
FADE OUT: Yours is nearly finished. The sale of the mill and the

FADE OUT: Signing contracts soon. I need Pete's signature. He's
FADE OUT: Catherine's heir.
FADE OUT: Will that be difficult?
FADE OUT: No.
FADE OUT: How long?
FADE OUT: Two days.
FADE OUT: We're expected back in Hong Kong.
FADE OUT: Mr. Eckhardt wants very much to see you.
FADE OUT: Are there any other ... complications?
FADE OUT: There may be a problem with Hank.
FADE OUT: I'll deal with him. Are we suspected?
FADE OUT: Certainly not.
FADE OUT: What about this sheriff?
FADE OUT: He means nothing to me.

FADE OUT: Thank you, Mr. Pete.
FADE OUT: And I can promise you, it hasn't been anywhere near a

FADE OUT: smile)

FADE OUT: 28. INT. ROADHOUSE - NIGHT
FADE OUT: Cooper sits at the bar by himself. He checks his watch. Nine-thirty. Swivels on his seat one
FADE OUT: way. When he swivels back the other way, Harry Truman's sitting next to him, out of
FADE OUT: uniform.
FADE OUT: Just about nine-thirty.
FADE OUT: Is he here?
FADE OUT: He's here.

FADE OUT: 29. INT. DOUBLE R DINER - NIGHT
FADE OUT: The darkened interior of the diner after hours. A doorbell is HEARD. A beat. Hank Jennings
FADE OUT: steps into the room wearing sweats, a sleepy expression, turns on an interior light, opens the
FADE OUT: front door. Nobody's there. Mutters, turns off the lights, and heads back to bed.
FADE OUT: A beat. And the doorbell RINGS a second time. A quiet noise is heard. And appliance
FADE OUT: lights, dim illumination, go dark in the shadows.
FADE OUT: HANK'S VOICE
FADE OUT: What the ...?
FADE OUT: Hank Jennings stumbles back into view. He tries the light switch. But this time nothing. The
FADE OUT: room remains dark. Hank fumbles through a drawer, produces a flashlight. He turns it on.
FADE OUT: Suddenly: the beam reveals Jonathan, the Asian Man. Hank reacts with surprise. He keeps
FADE OUT: the beam trained on the Asian Man's face, as if to blind him.
FADE OUT: Okay. What's the deal? What do you want?
FADE OUT: Hank makes his move. He swings the heavy flashlight at the Asian Man's head. But the Asian
FADE OUT: Man dodges the weapon with ease, catches Hank at the elbow, directs him forward, crashing
FADE OUT: into tables and chairs. The flashlight rolls on the floor, Hank retrieves it, gets to his feet
FADE OUT: and aims a high kick at the Asian Man's head. It's a glancing blow, but enough to knock the
FADE OUT: man off-balance.
FADE OUT: Hank attacks, the Asian man avoids his rush, sends him flying into a large refrigerator. Hank
FADE OUT: gasps, regroups. And charges again. This time the Asian Man plows a fist into his midsection,
FADE OUT: adds a blow to the back of Hank's neck. Hank lies still on the floor, huffs and puffs.
FADE OUT: Listen, I'm just gonna ... lie here for a while.
FADE OUT: The Asian Man kneels, retrieves the flashlight, aims it at him, steps toward Hank. Silent.
FADE OUT: What? What?
FADE OUT: The Asian Man stands over Hank, the flashlight aimed at his eyes. Hank puts up his arms to
FADE OUT: defend. But the Asian Man simply grabs him by the hand, brings their thumbs together - a
FADE OUT: bloodless approximation of Hank and Josie's partner ritual.
FADE OUT: Bloodbrother. Next time I'll take off your head.
FADE OUT: He smashes the flashlight against a counter.
