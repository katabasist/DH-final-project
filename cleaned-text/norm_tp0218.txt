INTERCUT: 5. INT. EARLE'S CABIN - DAY
INTERCUT: WINDOM EARLE fiddles with a deck of cards, as he sits and listens to the conversation.
INTERCUT: LEO JOHNSON, filthy rag over his arm ala a butler, pours Earle a drink from a can of beer.
INTERCUT: Enter Gordon Cole. This is so galling, Leo. Young
INTERCUT: Dale is continually refusing to play fair.
INTERCUT: 
INTERCUT: TRUMAN'S OFFICE
INTERCUT: As Cooper flips through Earle's file, Cole narrates.
INTERCUT: Medical report?
INTERCUT: WHEN EARLE WENT BOY - YOY - YOING THE
INTERCUT: HALOPERIDOL.
INTERCUT: The drug the one armed man, Gerard, was on.
INTERCUT: YOU GOT IT. BUT THEY SUSPECT HE WAS
INTERCUT: USING IT TO FAKE HIS ILLNESS. DEFINITE
INTERCUT: SCHIZOID MANEUVERING.
INTERCUT: Cooper stares at the next file. Flipping a page back and forth. Confused and fearful.
INTERCUT: "Project Blue Book." How could he have been working on that..?
INTERCUT: IN '65. REPORTS ON HIS TWO-YEAR HITCH
INTERCUT: ARE BLACKED OUT. NATIONAL SECURITY.
INTERCUT: Wait a minute, Earle was investigating UFO's?
INTERCUT: #2.018 Revised 1-23-91, YELLOW
INTERCUT: 5. CONTINUED:
INTERCUT: Another worry for the group.
INTERCUT: Some curious linkages here, Gordon.
INTERCUT: SAUSAGES. NEVER LIKED LINK SAUSAGES,
INTERCUT: THOUGH. PREFER PATTIES. BREAKFAST IS
INTERCUT: A GOOD IDEA.
INTERCUT: BONSAI. REMEMBER THOSE WORLD WAR
INTERCUT: TWO MOVIES?
INTERCUT: BONSAI.
INTERCUT: EARLE'S CABIN
INTERCUT: Cole's yelling has buried the needle. The cards shoot out of Earle's hands. He brings his hands
INTERCUT: to his ears.
INTERCUT: Damnation.
INTERCUT: TRUMAN'S OFFICE
INTERCUT: Doc and Truman exit. Cole watches them go. Pulls Cooper back and gives him a package.
INTERCUT: Cooper reaches into the package. He takes out his BADGE, GUN, and CREDENTIALS.
INTERCUT: KEEP THIS ON THE QT, COOP, BUT WITH
INTERCUT: EARLE ROLLING AROUND LOOSE ON DECK,
INTERCUT: WE NEED YOU BACK ON THE TEAM.
INTERCUT: BRAND NEW ISSUE. MORE ACCURATE AND
INTERCUT: EFFICIENT. SMITH AND WESSON, TEN
INTERCUT: MILLIMETER. MOD 1076. ALL STAINLESS
INTERCUT: STEEL. IT'S QUITE A BEAUTIFUL WEAPON.
INTERCUT: Thank you, Gordon.
INTERCUT: WE'RE GOING TO FIND EARLE, COOP. WE
INTERCUT: WILL PURSUE, CAPTURE, AND
INTERCUT: INCARCERATE.
INTERCUT: Cooper peers at Cole for a beat. Then, quite serious, gives him the Bureau thumb's up.
INTERCUT: #2.018 Revised 1-24-91, CHERRY
INTERCUT: 6. INT. EARLE'S CABIN - DAY
INTERCUT: Earle shuffles a deck of cards in front of Leo, then spreads them before him.
INTERCUT: Pick three cards, Leo.
INTERCUT: Leo picks cards out of the deck. Earle flips the cards over. THREE QUEENS. On the faces
INTERCUT: are pictures of DONNA, SHELLY, and AUDREY.
INTERCUT: Good. Now find the king.
INTERCUT: Leo picks another card and flips it over. A king is there with Cooper's face glued on it.
INTERCUT: And now we need one more Queen.
INTERCUT: Earle picks out a Queen without a face.
INTERCUT: The Queen of Hearts.
INTERCUT: He picks up a brochure for the MISS TWIN PEAKS CONTEST.
INTERCUT: Miss Twin Peaks. What do you get if you win. A
INTERCUT: dozen roses, a college scholarship, the accolades of your
INTERCUT: peers...
INTERCUT: Oh and I know you got to die. A royal execution.
INTERCUT: Earle spreads the rest of the deck out.
INTERCUT: And Cooper gets to watch.
INTERCUT: Flips them all over on their faces. They are all JOKERS.

FADE OUT: 7. EXT. GREAT NORTHERN - DAY
FADE OUT: The parking lot. A van pulls up. A ramp lowers. EILEEN HAYWARD wheels herself away
FADE OUT: from the van.
FADE OUT: Some distance away, Donna watches from the driver's seat of a car. She gets out and follows
FADE OUT: her mother.
FADE OUT: 8. INT. GREAT NORTHERN LOBBY/CORRIDOR - DAY
FADE OUT: Eileen wheels through the lobby and down the tile corridor. Donna follows at a distance. Stops
FADE OUT: and moves out of sight when she sees BEN HORNE greet her at the far end of the corridor.
FADE OUT: He helps move her around the corner out of sight.
FADE OUT: Donna wonders.
FADE OUT: 9. INT. GREAT NORTHERN LOBBY - DAY
FADE OUT: NADINE HURLEY with MIKE NELSON are checking out. He's got the blissful, glazed
FADE OUT: look of a sexual train wreck victim. Nadine holds onto his arm.
FADE OUT: How was everything sir?
FADE OUT: Unbelievable.
FADE OUT: Donna comes up to the desk.
FADE OUT: Is Audrey Horne here?
FADE OUT: She's in back, I'll get her for you.
FADE OUT: Hi, Donna.
FADE OUT: Hi, Donna.
FADE OUT: Hi.

FADE OUT: 9. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: Mike picks up his empty suitcase, he and Nadine stroll off towards the exit, arm in arm.
FADE OUT: Donna watches this curious exit, when Audrey appears in front of her.
FADE OUT: Donna?
FADE OUT: Hi, can I talk to you for a second?
FADE OUT: Sure.
FADE OUT: They move away.
FADE OUT: I feel kind of funny asking you this.
FADE OUT: What?
FADE OUT: Do you know any reason why my mom would be visiting
FADE OUT: your dad?
FADE OUT: Not off hand.
FADE OUT: He came to see her yesterday at the house. And today
FADE OUT: she drove here to see him.
FADE OUT: Maybe she's helping with the Stop Ghostwood campaign.
FADE OUT: If she was she'd have said something to me and she hasn't
FADE OUT: said a word.
FADE OUT: Is she here now?
FADE OUT: I think they're in his office together. Why?

FADE OUT: 10: OMITTED
FADE OUT: 11. DONNA'S POV
FADE OUT: Eileen and Ben Horne are in the middle of a heated discussion. She's trying to give him a
FADE OUT: small packet.
FADE OUT: - no, I won't accept them, they're yours, they were
FADE OUT: written to you -
FADE OUT: I don't want them. I won't have them in the house any
FADE OUT: longer.
FADE OUT: You've kept them twenty years, why now?
FADE OUT: I'm asking you the same question: why now? All you'll
FADE OUT: succeed in doing is ripping apart old wounds. I can't
FADE OUT: bear the thought of it.
FADE OUT: She's nearly overcome. He tries to comfort her.
FADE OUT: Eileen, Eileen, why won't you believe me?
FADE OUT: Words aren't good enough.
FADE OUT: I want my actions to speak for me. Haven't you been
FADE OUT: listening? I've been wrong all this time, I'm trying to
FADE OUT: make up for it -
FADE OUT: Sometimes making up for something only makes it
FADE OUT: worse.
FADE OUT: Have you told her?
FADE OUT: God no. No and I never will. You must promise me the
FADE OUT: #2.018 Revised 1-21-91, PINK
FADE OUT: 11. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: same.
FADE OUT: I'll never ask anything of you again.
FADE OUT: All right. All right.
FADE OUT: Take them. Please.
FADE OUT: Pause. He does.
FADE OUT: You mustn't call. You mustn't come to the house again.
FADE OUT: I understand.
FADE OUT: I should hope you do. Goodbye, Ben.
FADE OUT: Goodbye.
FADE OUT: Eileen wheels herself towards the door. Ben moves to help her. They move out of sight.
FADE OUT: 12. INT. AUDREY'S PEEPHOLE
FADE OUT: Audrey's taken Donna to her secret lair. They stand at the peephole, having witnessed part of
FADE OUT: the latter.
FADE OUT: What the hell was that all about?
FADE OUT: I don't know. But I'm going to find out.
FADE OUT: 13. EXT. DOUBLE R DINER - DAY
FADE OUT: #2.018 Revised 1-23-91, YELLOW
FADE OUT: 14. INT. DOUBLER DINER - DAY
FADE OUT: Truman, Cooper and Cole enter, Cole in mid-shout.
FADE OUT: - BEST CURE I EVER CAME ACROSS FOR A
FADE OUT: OF IT. BREAK AN EGG ON IT. TABASCO
FADE OUT: AND WORCHESTERSHIRE SAUCE.
FADE OUT: I'll be right with you guys.
FADE OUT: YOU.
FADE OUT: Truman heads for the bathroom again. The others sit in a booth. Most of the diner is
FADE OUT: listening.
FADE OUT: NOW THAT I COME TO MENTION IT, YOU
FADE OUT: KNOW WHAT I'M IN THE MOOD FOR? A
FADE OUT: TIFFANY'S.
FADE OUT: Gordon, you've come to the right place.
FADE OUT: SHELLY JOHNSON appears behind the counter. Gordon spots her.
FADE OUT: HOLY SMOKES, WHO IS THAT?
FADE OUT: Her name's Shelly Johnson.
FADE OUT: WHAT A BEAUTY. REMINDS ME OF THAT
FADE OUT: STATUE, THE BABE WITHOUT THE ARMS.
FADE OUT: Venus de Milo.
FADE OUT: THE NAME WAS MILO BUT THAT'S BESIDE
FADE OUT: THE POINT. THAT'S THE KIND OF GIRL
FADE OUT: #2.018
FADE OUT: 14. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: KNEW A LITTLE FRENCH.
FADE OUT: EXCUSE ME, WHILE I TRY MY HAND AT A
FADE OUT: LITTLE COUNTER ESPERANTO.
FADE OUT: Cole floats away. We follow him over to where Shelly continues to clean up the counter.
FADE OUT: Cole sits near her.
FADE OUT: HELLO. I'M WONDERING IF I MIGHT
FADE OUT: SMALL AMUSEMENT.
FADE OUT: She smiles. Looks over at Cooper, who gives her an OK sign.
FADE OUT: THE NAME'S GORDON COLE AND I
FADE OUT: COULDN'T HELP BUT NOTICE YOU FROM
FADE OUT: THE BOOTH AND WELL, I SUDDENLY FEEL
FADE OUT: LIKE I HAVE A BELLY FULL OF SPIROKEETS.
FADE OUT: You don 't have to shout, sir, I can hear you perfectly
FADE OUT: well.
FADE OUT: I HEARD THAT.
FADE OUT: I HEARD THAT.
FADE OUT: Would you like anything besides coffee?
FADE OUT: I HEARD YOU PERFECTLY.
FADE OUT: And I can hear you. Honest. You don't have to shout.
FADE OUT: YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND -
FADE OUT: She shusses him, amused.
FADE OUT: #2.018 Revised 1-23-91, YELLOW
FADE OUT: 14. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: - you don't understand, Miss Johnson, do you see these?
FADE OUT: He points to his hearing aids.
FADE OUT: Yes I do.
FADE OUT: I've spent the last twenty years asking folks to speak up,
FADE OUT: but for some weird reason I can hear you clear as a bell.
FADE OUT: Say something else.
FADE OUT: Would you like some pie with your coffee?
FADE OUT: Good Lord, I can hear every word you say. This is
FADE OUT: some kind of a miracle, a-a-a phenomenom.
FADE OUT: The LOG LADY, who has been sitting at the counter, chimes in.
FADE OUT: My log thinks the cherry pie is a miracle as well.
FADE OUT: WHAT'S THAT?
FADE OUT: The cherry pie.
FADE OUT: I heard you. I heard you again.
FADE OUT: So would you like some pie?
FADE OUT: Massive. Massive quantities. And a glass of water,
FADE OUT: sweetheart, my socks are on fire.
FADE OUT: COLE sits there with an absolute grin.
FADE OUT: 15. COOPER AND TRUMAN
FADE OUT: ANNIE BLACKBURNE moves to the booth to take their order. They're staring out the
FADE OUT: window. Annie does as well.
FADE OUT: #2.018 Revised 1-23-91, YELLOW
FADE OUT: 15. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: Chickadee - sitting on a Dodge Dart.
FADE OUT: Think it's a finch - sitting on a Dodge Dart..
FADE OUT: Nope. Chickadee. On a Dodge Dart.
FADE OUT: Cooper turns back to see Annie smiling at him.
FADE OUT: Hi.
FADE OUT: Hi. Coffee?
FADE OUT: For me.
FADE OUT: What's good for a hangover?
FADE OUT: Teetotaling and prayer.
FADE OUT: Good answer.
FADE OUT: Anyway, a cure might make you feel better and you're
FADE OUT: supposed to suffer for your sins, remember?
FADE OUT: That's a great comfort to me. I'll try coffee.
FADE OUT: How are you today?
FADE OUT: I'm fine. Actually, I'm weird. I'm disoriented. I'm
FADE OUT: not sure where I am exactly. I mean I know but it feels
FADE OUT: odd, being here. I'm okay.
FADE OUT: #2.018 Revised 1-23-91, YELLOW
FADE OUT: 15. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: Good.
FADE OUT: Gosh, listen to me, I've been out of circulation so long
FADE OUT: I've completely forgotten about social niceties. I mean,
FADE OUT: you ask me how I am, I'm not really supposed to say how
FADE OUT: I am, I'm supposed to say, "I'm fine, thanks, how are you?"
FADE OUT: Cooper smiles. He likes her a lot and he can't hide it.
FADE OUT: You must think I'm really strange.
FADE OUT: Not at all.
FADE OUT: But I mean, with due consideration to the social niceties,
FADE OUT: even if I asked you and you did think I was strange, you
FADE OUT: wouldn't say so, would you?
FADE OUT: If I thought you were strange, I would tell you.
FADE OUT: And you don't. Think so.
FADE OUT: Not for a second.
FADE OUT: Truman's been watching this like a ping-pong match.
FADE OUT: Okay. Good. Glad we cleared that up. So. What'll
FADE OUT: you have?
FADE OUT: Chicken pot pie. And a glass of milk.
FADE OUT: Good choice. All the major food groups represented.
FADE OUT: Turkey sandwhich. Whole wheat. Lettuce. A hair of
FADE OUT: mayonaise. And I've got a joke for you: a couple of
FADE OUT: penguins are walking across an iceberg and the first one
FADE OUT: #2.018 Revised 1-23-91, YELLOW
FADE OUT: 15. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: says to the second, "You look like you're wearing a
FADE OUT: tuxedo."
FADE OUT: SHELLY'S VOICE
FADE OUT: Annie?
FADE OUT: COLE'S VOICE
FADE OUT: I heard that.
FADE OUT: Wait, I'll be right back.
FADE OUT: I wasn't quite finished.
FADE OUT: Pause.
FADE OUT: How long have you been in love with her?
FADE OUT: Who said anything about love?
FADE OUT: Coop, you just tried to tell her a joke.
FADE OUT: Cooper is nailed. Maybe Truman's right. Not sure what to say. Annie comes back.
FADE OUT: Okay, what did the second penguin say?
FADE OUT: The first one says, "You look like you're wearing a
FADE OUT: tuxedo." And the second one says, "Maybe I am."
FADE OUT: The defense rests.
FADE OUT: That was cute.
FADE OUT: Thank you.
FADE OUT: Pause. They look at each other. Annie realizes what she's doing, glances down at his napkin,
FADE OUT: where Cooper's been doodling.
FADE OUT: What are you drawing?
FADE OUT: #2.018 Revised 1-23-91, YELLOW
FADE OUT: 15. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: Cooper looks down at his napkin.
FADE OUT: 16. NAPKIN
FADE OUT: He's doodling the tattos on the Log Lady and Major Briggs.
FADE OUT: Oh. Nothing. A couple of tattoos.
FADE OUT: Funny. Looks like the rocks in Owl Cave.
FADE OUT: She moves off. Cooper watches her go, a little moonstruck. Another look at the napkin, then
FADE OUT: Cooper snaps back on the beam.
FADE OUT: Owl Cave? What's Owl Cave?
FADE OUT: It's up near Pearl Lakes. Old Indian territory.
FADE OUT: Supposed to be sacred ground. We used to go there
FADE OUT: when we were kids.
FADE OUT: My God it does. It does look like it.
FADE OUT: Sounds like we better go there now.
FADE OUT: They exchange a smile. Move in on the napkin.
FADE OUT: 
FADE OUT: #2.018
FADE OUT: 17. INT. HAYWARD HOUSE - DAY
FADE OUT: Donna steps through the living room, leafing through a handful of afternoon mail. She stops
FADE OUT: suddenly, stares at a postcard, SAN FRANCISCO emblazoned across a rendering of the
FADE OUT: Golden Gate bridge. Donna turns the card over, reads. We HEAR:
FADE OUT: JAMES' VOICE
FADE OUT: Dear Donna. You were right. I had to go. Everything
FADE OUT: feels different when you're on the road. It feels better.
FADE OUT: San Francisco is really cool. Next stop, Mexico. I'll be
FADE OUT: back with a million stories. Promise. I love you, James.
FADE OUT: Donna looks up, tearful. DOC HAYWARD enters the room, sees the postcard in her hands.
FADE OUT: James? How is he?
FADE OUT: He's good. He's doing what he needed to do.
FADE OUT: Hayward putters with at the table. Donna watches him for a beat.
FADE OUT: Dad? Can I ask you something?
FADE OUT: Sure.
FADE OUT: How does Mom know Ben Horne?
FADE OUT: Hayward tries to hide the jolt her question brings. He looks into his daughter's eyes, and lies.
FADE OUT: I doubt that she does, Donna. Not very well.
FADE OUT: But he was over here yesterday. They were talking like
FADE OUT: old friends.
FADE OUT: Your mother works with the local charities. I'm sure
FADE OUT: even Ben contributes once in a while.
FADE OUT: #2.018
FADE OUT: 17. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: She drove to the Great Northern this morning. And she
FADE OUT: saw him again.
FADE OUT: Probably something to do with a fundraiser ...
FADE OUT: I don't think so.
FADE OUT: ... yes, that's it. Eileen mentioned it to me at breakfast.
FADE OUT: One of those Heal The Planet things.
FADE OUT: She never said anything about it to me.
FADE OUT: Well that's exactly what it is. Your mother told me so.
FADE OUT: Donna pauses, uncertain. Just then: the doorbell RINGS.
FADE OUT: I'll get it.
FADE OUT: Donna steps to the door, off-screen. Hayward watches his daughter with evident concern.
FADE OUT: When Donna returns, she holds a bouquet of flowers in her arms.
FADE OUT: They're for Mom. No card.
FADE OUT: HOLD ON Donna for a beat. A blossom for every lie her father told her.
FADE OUT: 18. INT. TWIN PEAKS CITY LIBRARY - DAY
FADE OUT: Audrey walks between dark library stacks, thinking about Wheeler, energized. She mounts a
FADE OUT: short ladder, inspects a row of dusty books. She removes one, leafs through it, eyes seeking
FADE OUT: pertinent information. Audrey begins to read, when ... SUDDENLY a footfall, Audrey looks
FADE OUT: up. A man stands close by in the shadows. Startled, Audrey nearly tips the ladder. But the
FADE OUT: quick-handed stranger grabs and steadies it.
FADE OUT: Sorry. My fault.
FADE OUT: It's okay. I didn't hear you coming...
FADE OUT: #2.018
FADE OUT: 18. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: One should never allow both mind and foot to wander at
FADE OUT: the same time. Edward Perkins. Again, my apologies.
FADE OUT: Audrey Horne. Pleased to meet you, Mister Perkins.
FADE OUT: ANOTHER ANGLE reveals that she is shaking the hand of Windom Earle. He is dressed as a
FADE OUT: absent-minded academic. Trousers, shirt, cardigan sweater, wire-rim glasses. He eyes
FADE OUT: Audrey closely throughout, just short of rudeness, as if measuring her for some future use.
FADE OUT: What brings you to the library?
FADE OUT: Research. On civil disobedience.
FADE OUT: Good for you. It is incumbent on the young to disobey.
FADE OUT: Are you a professor?
FADE OUT: I teach. Poetry is my area of expertise.
FADE OUT: You're kidding. Someone sent me a poem. Wait.
FADE OUT: She reaches into her jacket, pulls out the poem Windom sent to his three queens, now taped
FADE OUT: together. She holds it out for him to inspect. But Earle quietly demurs.
FADE OUT: You read it.
FADE OUT: See the montains kiss high Heaven
FADE OUT: And the waves clasp one another,
FADE OUT: No sister flower would be forgiven
FADE OUT: If it disdained its brother;
FADE OUT: And the sunlight clasps the earth
FADE OUT: And the moonbeams kiss the sea...
FADE OUT: What is this sweet work worth
FADE OUT: If thou kiss not me?
FADE OUT: #2.018
FADE OUT: 18. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: Yes ... you know it.
FADE OUT: Oh yes. Shelly.
FADE OUT: Earle says it softly, wistful. He peers at Audrey with an intense expression. She wonders:
FADE OUT: What ...?
FADE OUT: Gazing at you, perched on that ladder, reciting Shelly's
FADE OUT: verse ... you look very much like a Queen.
FADE OUT: Oh. Thanks. Well. I better go.
FADE OUT: Nice to meet you Mr. Perkins.
FADE OUT: Perhaps we'll meet again someday.
FADE OUT: Earle watches Audrey carry her book into the shadows.
FADE OUT: 19. INT. SHERIFF'S STATION - DAY
FADE OUT: Cooper leads Andy and Hawk through the station. The deputies carry armloads of equipment
FADE OUT: - safety helmets, flashlights, pick-axes and rope. LUCY MORAN sits at her post, watches
FADE OUT: them pass. She sees Andy and sighs. He looks bold, dashing, ready for adventure.
FADE OUT: Andy?
FADE OUT: Andy lingers. Cooper and Hawk continue to the Sheriff's office.
FADE OUT: Yes, Lucy?
FADE OUT: I want to thank you for helping out during the Weasel
FADE OUT: Riot yesterday which is more than I can say for a certain
FADE OUT: Dick we both know.
FADE OUT: #2.018
FADE OUT: 19. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: Keeping the peace is part of my job.
FADE OUT: Where are you going with all of that gear?
FADE OUT: Spelunking.
FADE OUT: Is it dangerous, spelunking?
FADE OUT: Sometimes.
FADE OUT: Promise me something?
FADE OUT: Okay.
FADE OUT: I know you'll be strong. And I know you'll be brave.
FADE OUT: But I want you to promise me you'll be careful.
FADE OUT: I'll be careful, Lucy. You have my word.
FADE OUT: HOLD ON them for a beat. Love rekindled, or nearly so.
FADE OUT: 20. INT. SHERIFF TRUMAN'S OFFICE - DAY
FADE OUT: Truman peers down at the chess board as if to visualize the battle Cooper and Earle are
FADE OUT: fighting there. He reaches out to touch a piece when the door to his office OPENS. Truman,
FADE OUT: still suffering from a world class hangover, turns to face Cooper as he enters.
FADE OUT: Pete just called in our next move.
FADE OUT: Truman hands a piece of paper to Cooper. Cooper reads it, steps to the board, moves the
FADE OUT: appropriate piece. He considers the resulting formation.
FADE OUT: We expose a pawn to his bishop.
FADE OUT: #2.018
FADE OUT: 20. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: Want me to hold off?
FADE OUT: No. If he takes the pawn he'll forfeit the bishop and
FADE OUT: most of his initial advantage. Feeling any better, Harry?
FADE OUT: Like someone pounded a railroad spike into my ear.
FADE OUT: Then a descent into a cool, subteranean cave may be just
FADE OUT: what the doctor ordered.
FADE OUT: Cooper tosses the helmet to Truman. He catches it cleanly.
FADE OUT: 21. EXT. DOUBLE R DINER - DAY
FADE OUT: 22. INT. DOUBLER DINER - DAY
FADE OUT: The diner is quiet, nearly empty. Annie cleans the counter, pauses to retrieve a flyer. It
FADE OUT: reads: THE MISS TWIN PEAKS PAGEANT, our Twentieth Anniversary. Shelly steps into
FADE OUT: view, reads it over Annie's shoulder.
FADE OUT: Thinking of entering?
FADE OUT: I think the real world's strange enough without getting up
FADE OUT: on stage and parading around in a bathing suit and heels'
FADE OUT: Guess they're not too big on that kind of stuff in the
FADE OUT: convent.
FADE OUT: That's a good guess.
FADE OUT: Is it strange, you know, being back in civilization?
FADE OUT: It wasn't as if they kept us locked up in the attic. We
FADE OUT: had newspapers. We even had cable TV. Every time I
FADE OUT: tell someone where I've been they act like I'm out on
FADE OUT: parole.
FADE OUT: #2.018
FADE OUT: 22. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: Sorry.
FADE OUT: You know what's weird? Being around men again.
FADE OUT: You don't have to spend time in a convent to feel that.
FADE OUT: What do you know about Agent Cooper?
FADE OUT: Are you interested?
FADE OUT: It's like anthropology. Examing the native flora and
FADE OUT: fauna. For educational purposes
FADE OUT: Uh-huh.
FADE OUT: So. Tell me about him.
FADE OUT: Okay. He's a few years older than you. Handsome, but
FADE OUT: not too handsome. He's really, really smart. He's in the
FADE OUT: FBI. He loves Twin Peaks. He loves pie and coffee.
FADE OUT: And trees.
FADE OUT: Good. Now I won't have to send to Washington for his
FADE OUT: file.
FADE OUT: And judging from the look on his face when he saw you
FADE OUT: today, I'd say you have a major opporunity.
FADE OUT: Who said anything about that?
FADE OUT: Shelly walks away, with a knowing smile.
FADE OUT: #2.018 Revised 1-22-91, GREEN

FADE OUT: 24. INT. BEN HORNE'S OFFICE - DAY
FADE OUT: Ben paces, taking bites from a carrot. Audrey, sits upon the office sofa, looks on with an
FADE OUT: admiring smile.
FADE OUT: Audrey, when Jack Kennedy entered the White House, he
FADE OUT: took his brother with him, because he trusted Bobby to
FADE OUT: tell him the truth even when it wasn't pretty. When the
FADE OUT: Bay of Pigs went up in smoke, Bobby was there. When
FADE OUT: the Russians moved missiles into Fidel's backyard,
FADE OUT: Bobby helped his brother shoulder through.
FADE OUT: Sort of like Jerry's been for you?
FADE OUT: The unvarnished truth is what I am looking for. I
FADE OUT: believe you are the best man for the job.
FADE OUT: Me?
FADE OUT: Ben kneels down before her, pauses. This is a new Ben. This comes straight from the heart.
FADE OUT: Audrey, I haven't always been a good father to you. Oh,
FADE OUT: hell, who am I kidding? When was I ever anything but a
FADE OUT: sleazy rapacious heel?
FADE OUT: Well. When I was little, maybe... I...
FADE OUT: Audrey shrugs. Ben lived a life devoid of any and all goodness.
FADE OUT: Exactly. But I've changed. And I'm determined to do
FADE OUT: #2.018
FADE OUT: 24. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: better. To be the kind of father you'll respect some day.
FADE OUT: I think about Laura. I think about the mistakes I've
FADE OUT: made...
FADE OUT: I want to build a life in happiness. For the whole
FADE OUT: family. Together.
FADE OUT: Won't you help me? Please?
FADE OUT: Daddy, I'm your man.
FADE OUT: A warm beat. Ben rises, beaming.
FADE OUT: Sensational. Audrey, pack a bag get out to the
FADE OUT: airport. Your plane leaves in an hour.
FADE OUT: My plane?
FADE OUT: John! Just the man I want to see.
FADE OUT: John Wheeler pauses in the open doorway, enters. Audrey turns to meet his gaze, remembers
FADE OUT: their plans for this evening. Her plane?!
FADE OUT: Daddy, I...
FADE OUT: Hello, Ben.
FADE OUT: Audrey, you'd better get moving. One hour.
FADE OUT: Audrey's flying to Seattle tonight. She's having a
FADE OUT: breakfast confab with the Sierra Club. We're going
FADE OUT: national with this Pine Weasel thing.
FADE OUT: I'm not sure I can leave on such short ...
FADE OUT: Here are the particulars. Time, place, and so on. Bring
FADE OUT: #2.018
FADE OUT: 24. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: us back some good news.
FADE OUT: Good news.
FADE OUT: Audrey looks up. Her father beaming. Wheeler thinking about tonight. All the things they
FADE OUT: cannot say to Ben just yet. Or to each other.
FADE OUT: I'd better go.
FADE OUT: Goodbye.
FADE OUT: Goodbye.
FADE OUT: Ben, unaware, wraps his daughter in a big farewell hug.
FADE OUT: Bless you, Audrey. Safe passage.
FADE OUT: Audrey takes one last look at Wheeler and walks out the door. A beat. And Ben slumps
FADE OUT: down on the sofa with a mighty sigh.
FADE OUT: What's wrong, Ben?
FADE OUT: I am filled to the brim with goodness. Like a
FADE OUT: Christmas tree all lit up inside me. But at the end of the
FADE OUT: day, when I look in the mirror, I have to face the fact
FADE OUT: that I don't really know how to be good.
FADE OUT: You're off to a pretty fair start.
FADE OUT: How do you do it, John? What's your secret? Can I learn
FADE OUT: to be good too?
FADE OUT: I don't see why not. Keep an eye on your heart. Always
FADE OUT: tell the truth.
FADE OUT: #2.018
FADE OUT: 24. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: Always tell the truth.
FADE OUT: Tell the hardest truth first.
FADE OUT: Terrific. Tell the hardest truth first. I love that. jack,
FADE OUT: this truth business is clearly at the forefront of goodness.
FADE OUT: Ben ...
FADE OUT: Yes, jack?
FADE OUT: I'm falling in love with your daughter.
FADE OUT: Now there's a hard truth.
FADE OUT: It is the truth.
FADE OUT: It is?
FADE OUT: Yes.
FADE OUT: A long beat. Ben pats Wheeler on the knee. Father to son.
FADE OUT: Ahh, Jack. What a wonderful world we live in.
FADE OUT: HOLD ON Ben and Wheeler for a beat. Side by side upon the sofa. Ben offers Wheeler a
FADE OUT: carrot. Wheeler accepts.
FADE OUT: FADE TO BLACK.

FADE OUT: 25. EXT. OWL CAVE - NIGHT
FADE OUT: Two police vehicles parked in the dark, their lights shining brightly upon the rock formations
FADE OUT: that enclose Owl Cave.
FADE OUT: 26. INT. OWL CAVE - NIGHT
FADE OUT: START CLOSE on a pair of gloved hands desperately seeking purchase on a rocky wall.
FADE OUT: Flashlight beams illuminate the scene. Encouraging voices are HEARD:
FADE OUT: TRUMAN, COOPER, HAWK
FADE OUT: That's it, Andy. Careful. One hand at a time.
FADE OUT: CAMERA PULLS back to reveal Andy's head pressed against the wall, grimacing with effort,
FADE OUT: and not a little afraid. He grunts, hand over hand, as Truman and the others shout instructions
FADE OUT: from below. Then, finally, with one last moan ... Andy sinks out of frame like a stone.
FADE OUT: Andy lands with a thud on the floor of Owl Cave. Flashlight beams criss-cross his features as
FADE OUT: Cooper, Truman, and Hawk huddle about him
FADE OUT: Are you all right?
FADE OUT: I'm fine.
FADE OUT: They part, help Andy to his feet. And turn their lights on the interior of the cave. It is a large,
FADE OUT: airy space filled with rocky outcroppings, strange shapes in the dark.
FADE OUT: Incredible.
FADE OUT: As the beams of light trip across the cave walls, Hawk intones:
FADE OUT: We used to play here when I was a kid. Pretend it was
FADE OUT: haunted by fierce ghosts.
FADE OUT: Truman kicks something in the dark, picks it up. A beer can.
FADE OUT: Beer drinkers, by the look of it.
FADE OUT: #2.018
FADE OUT: 26. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: Where is the symbol?
FADE OUT: This way.
FADE OUT: Hawk swings his flashlight beam across the cave, illuminates the far wall. And a ROCKY
FADE OUT: SHAPE upon it. Cooper and Truman aim their beams as well, step closer.
FADE OUT: Yes ...
FADE OUT: The rocky symbol is a rough-hewn rendering of Cooper's drawing. An easily discernable shape
FADE OUT: extruding from the cave wall. It does not appear to be man-made.
FADE OUT: Two symbols combined into a larger whole. But for
FADE OUT: what purpose?
FADE OUT: I don't know, Coop. It's similar, there's no denying that.
FADE OUT: It's more than similar, Harry. The tattoos are a
FADE OUT: question. And this, somehow, is the answer.
FADE OUT: Andy listens gravely, pick-axe over his shoulder, afraid. He flashes his light upon the symbol,
FADE OUT: forces himself a little closer. As if determined to contribute despite his fears.
FADE OUT: Why do they call it Owl Cave?
SUDDENLY: an owl's SHRIEK to wake the dead, the FLAPPING of enormous wings,
SUDDENLY: something passes through the shadows overhead. Several things happen simultaneously:
SUDDENLY: Cooper, Hawk, and Truman whip their flashlights toward the passing sounds, but find nothing.
SUDDENLY: Andy yips, panics, and whirls about. His pick-axe STRIKING the cave symbol with a
SUDDENLY: mighty blow. Rocks chip and tumble, a sort of whooshing rumble is heard ... and a small
SUDDENLY: LANDSLIDE tumbles down upon his head.
SUDDENLY: Andy!
SUDDENLY: All rush to his side, claw through the rocks and detritus. Andy lays beneath, bruised, stunned,
SUDDENLY: but essentially unharmed.

SUDDENLY: 33-34.
SUDDENLY: 26. CONTINUED:
SUDDENLY: What was that?
SUDDENLY: An owl.
SUDDENLY: I'm sorry. I destroyed a national monument.
SUDDENLY: Forget it, Andy. It's just a rock. The important thing -
SUDDENLY: Coop?
SUDDENLY: Cooper isn't listening. He's shining his light on the cave wall, the section revealed by the slide.
SUDDENLY: His eyes are filled with wonder.
SUDDENLY: What is it?
SUDDENLY: I'm not sure.
SUDDENLY: Cooper steps forward, their beams join his to illuminate the wall. And there, partially
SUDDENLY: obscured by the rock that remains, is a CAVE PAINTING of startling color and design.
SUDDENLY: Good God.
SUDDENLY: It appears to be a hieroglyph. We'll need the proper
SUDDENLY: tools to excavate. Harry, I have no idea where this will
SUDDENLY: lead us. But I have a feeling, a definite feeling, it will
SUDDENLY: be a place both wonderful and strange.
SUDDENLY: Cooper reaches out to touch the mysterious design. HOLD ON the cave painting for a beat.
SUDDENLY: The rocky formation that once hid it from view.

SUDDENLY: 28. EXT. THE GREAT NORTHERN - NIGHT
SUDDENLY: 28A. INT. CORRIDOR NEAR DINING ROOM
SUDDENLY: Cooper returns, speaking into his recorder.
SUDDENLY: Diane. Wednesday night, late. Have just returned from from
SUDDENLY: a place called Owl Cave. How I got there is a long and
SUDDENLY: complicated story, but I will try to recount it
SUDDENLY: accurately. It all began with a pair of matching
SUDDENLY: tattoos...
SUDDENLY: Cooper stops, looks off. He sees someone familiar in the dining room/bar.
SUDDENLY: 29. INT. GREAT NORTHERN BAR - NIGHT
SUDDENLY: Annie Blackburne enters and sits alone at the bar, curious, uncertain. Will she ever be a part of
SUDDENLY: this world? Annie raises an arm, tentative, to flag the bartender. Her actions are not those of
SUDDENLY: someone timid or shy. But rather the first halting steps of a stranger new to a strange land.
SUDDENLY: #2.018
SUDDENLY: 29. CONTINUED:
SUDDENLY: Excuse me?
SUDDENLY: I'd like something to drink. I'm not exactly sure what.
SUDDENLY: Ladies seem to like rum.
SUDDENLY: Rum. I'll have one, please. With...?
SUDDENLY: Tonic.
SUDDENLY: The bartender steps off to fetch and pour. Annie turns her eyes back to the smokey room:
SUDDENLY: couples seated at tables, talking, intimate and close. Annie watches with fascination and
SUDDENLY: regret. A familiar VOICE penetrates her reverie. Agent Cooper.
SUDDENLY: Hello, Annie.
SUDDENLY: Hi.
SUDDENLY: Could I get you...
SUDDENLY: Annie notices the bartender has left her a cocktail.
SUDDENLY: No, thank you. I have rum and tonic.
SUDDENLY: I see.
SUDDENLY: One of the Sister's put rum in her tea. I've never tasted it
SUDDENLY: before, but it sounds exotic. so I ...
SUDDENLY: I lived in a convent for five years. I might as well be
SUDDENLY: from Mars.
SUDDENLY: You're doing fine. You're here, on your own. And you
SUDDENLY: have rum and tonic.
SUDDENLY: Cooper speaks with quiet humor and affection. Just the support Annie needs. She smiles
SUDDENLY: appreciatively, lifts the glass to her lips, takes a drink. Reacts curiously. Not unpleasant.
SUDDENLY: #2.018
SUDDENLY: 29. CONTINUED:
SUDDENLY: Cooper watches her gazing at the room, the wonder and doubt in her eyes. Annie senses him
SUDDENLY: watching her, Cooper wonders:
SUDDENLY: It's all new to you. Everything.
SUDDENLY: I feel constantly amazed ... stunned. Music, people.
SUDDENLY: The way they laugh and talk. Some of them so clearly
SUDDENLY: in love. It's like a foreign language to me. I know just
SUDDENLY: enough of the words to realize how little I understand.
SUDDENLY: I'd like to see the world through your eyes.
SUDDENLY: Why?
SUDDENLY: There are things I would do differently if I had the
SUDDENLY: chance to start over again.
SUDDENLY: Me too.
SUDDENLY: Annie pauses, as if to consider a painful memory. She reaches for her glass of water, her sleeve
SUDDENLY: slips up, reveals scars on her wrist. Cooper sees it, says nothing. But Annie knows he saw them.
SUDDENLY: The thing is, I've failed before. I'm afraid I might fail
SUDDENLY: again.
SUDDENLY: Do you want to talk about it?
SUDDENLY: Not yet.
SUDDENLY: A beat. Cooper peers at Annie, feels something turn inside his heart. He falls in love.
SUDDENLY: Can I help you, Annie?
SUDDENLY: Can you?
SUDDENLY: Show you the world. Will you let me?
SUDDENLY: #2.018 Revised 1-21-91, PINK
SUDDENLY: 29. CONTINUED:
SUDDENLY: I'm stubborn. Extremely willful.
SUDDENLY: I can handle that.
SUDDENLY: Some people think I'm weird.
SUDDENLY: I know the feeling.
SUDDENLY: I can't promise you I'd always make sense, or do the
SUDDENLY: things you expect me to.
SUDDENLY: I don't expect anything.
SUDDENLY: Then I accept your kind and generous offer.
SUDDENLY: Cooper smiles in kind, reaches out to touch Annie's hand and hold it, just below the scars. He's
SUDDENLY: wanted to touch her from the first moment they met.
SUDDENLY: 30. INT. OWL CAVE - NIGHT
SUDDENLY: SUDDENLY - CAMERA follows a flashlight beam as it pierces the darkness inside Owl
SUDDENLY: Cave. The beam splashes light upon the cave's rocky walls, then, finally, holds on the landslide
SUDDENLY: aftermath, the symbol's fragment, the cave painting revealed beneath.
SUDDENLY: A beat. ANOTHER ANGLE reveals the man holding onto the flashlight, now staring
SUDDENLY: intently at the cave painting. It is Windom Earle.
SUDDENLY: My, my, my. What have we here?
SUDDENLY: FADE TO BLACK.
SUDDENLY: THE END
