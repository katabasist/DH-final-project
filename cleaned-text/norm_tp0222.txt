FIRST DRAFT: 2. INT. SHERIFF'S STATION - NIGHT
FIRST DRAFT: Pageant GIRLS enter for questioning. They pass ANDY BRENNEN and LUCY MORAN
FIRST DRAFT: in mid-conversation.
FIRST DRAFT: - and the lights went out. I kept thinking: The lights are
FIRST DRAFT: going out, the lights are going out and then they did and
FIRST DRAFT: it all went black. And then I kept thinking: What about
FIRST DRAFT: hand signals? What good would they do us now? And the
FIRST DRAFT: baby. What if the lights when out in hospital, and you
FIRST DRAFT: were in the elevator?
FIRST DRAFT: Then I'd help you have that baby right there in the
FIRST DRAFT: elevator in front of God and everybody.
FIRST DRAFT: They kiss. Andy whispers romantically.
FIRST DRAFT: It's a map, Lucy.
FIRST DRAFT: What?
FIRST DRAFT: I figured out that the puzzle was a map not a puzzle. I
FIRST DRAFT: solved the puzzle.
FIRST DRAFT: How?
FIRST DRAFT: Suddenly I saw all the pieces come together. It was sort
FIRST DRAFT: of like that old game show, "Concentration?"
FIRST DRAFT: 3. INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT
FIRST DRAFT: COOPER hovers over the hieroglyph/map. HAWK and a second DEPUTY stand to the rear,
FIRST DRAFT: #2.022
FIRST DRAFT: 3. CONTINUED:
FIRST DRAFT: impassive. TRUMAN hurries to join them. More bad news.
FIRST DRAFT: Earle got away. Nobody saw him or Annie. Sorry,
FIRST DRAFT: Coop.
FIRST DRAFT: We know it's a map, Harry, but of what?
FIRST DRAFT: The giant and the little man from my dream are there.
FIRST DRAFT: Are they telling us to go somewhere? Damn it, where?
FIRST DRAFT: Maybe we should try to find Earle's cabin.
FIRST DRAFT: That's not where, he is - there's no time.
FIRST DRAFT: PETE MARTELL busts into room. Furious and shouting.
FIRST DRAFT: Grand theft, Auto. The Log Lady stole my truck.
FIRST DRAFT: 68 Dodge truck. Powder blue like the dust kicked up at
FIRST DRAFT: sunset. I tried to run after it till I saw those beautiful tail
FIRST DRAFT: lights turn and head up the road towards -
FIRST DRAFT: The woods. Ghostwood National Park.
FIRST DRAFT: Truman looks at the map with new eyes. Instantly.
FIRST DRAFT: Here's something, Coop.
FIRST DRAFT: Twelve trees in a perfect circle. There's a place like that
FIRST DRAFT: up in Ghostwood, it's called Glastonbury Grove -
FIRST DRAFT: Glastonbury. That's the legendary burial place of King
FIRST DRAFT: Arthur.
FIRST DRAFT: King Arthur's buried near here?
FIRST DRAFT: No, in England. This feels right, Harry, let's get up
FIRST DRAFT: there.
FIRST DRAFT: #2.022
FIRST DRAFT: 3. CONTINUED:
FIRST DRAFT: They hurry to the door. The Deputies fall into step.
FIRST DRAFT: Hawk, get Major Briggs from the infirmary, and see if he
FIRST DRAFT: can help you find Earle's cabin.
FIRST DRAFT: You'll find Leo Johnson there. Maybe he can tell us
FIRST DRAFT: something about Earle -
FIRST DRAFT: Call the State Patrol, I want a dragnet in those woods
FIRST DRAFT: leading up to the Grove, then you meet us up there -
FIRST DRAFT: Cooper stops at the door. Edgy.
FIRST DRAFT: Harry, I can't ask you to go.
FIRST DRAFT: Stow it, Coop. Let's roll.
FIRST DRAFT: They exit.
FIRST DRAFT: 4. INT. HURLEY HOUSE - NIGHT
FIRST DRAFT: NADINE HURLEY blances a large ice pack on her head, mind thoroughly elsewhere.
FIRST DRAFT: MIKE NELSON escorts DOC HAYWARD to the door.
FIRST DRAFT: Twenty minutes on, twenty minutes off. That should
FIRST DRAFT: reduce the swelling. Don't forget the aspirin.
FIRST DRAFT: Thanks, Doc.
FIRST DRAFT: Hayward exits. Mike steps back to Nadine, settles on the couch beside her. Nadine stares
FIRST DRAFT: straight ahead, into the dim future.
FIRST DRAFT: Does it hurt much, baby?
FIRST DRAFT: Who?
FIRST DRAFT: Mike lifts the ice bag, gently kisses the growing knot on Nadine's head.
FIRST DRAFT: #2.022
FIRST DRAFT: 4. CONTINUED:
FIRST DRAFT: I'm sorry you lost.
FIRST DRAFT: Who?
FIRST DRAFT: God, Nadine I was so worried about you. I admit there
FIRST DRAFT: were times when I had my doubts about what we meant to
FIRST DRAFT: each other, but seeing that sandbag hit you, I knew that
FIRST DRAFT: I'd practically do anything for you.
FIRST DRAFT: Who?
FIRST DRAFT: I love you. There I said it and I'm glad.
FIRST DRAFT: Mike gently cups her chin, turns Nadine's face toward him, offers a passionate kiss. But
FIRST DRAFT: Nadine pulls free, looks at him with complete surprise. And a palpable lack of recognition.
FIRST DRAFT: Who are you?
FIRST DRAFT: Mike.
FIRST DRAFT: You try to stick your tongue down my throat and then, as
FIRST DRAFT: some sort of explanation, you say your name is Mike?
FIRST DRAFT: What the hell are you doing in my house, anyway?!
FIRST DRAFT: You, you brought me here.
FIRST DRAFT: Bullpucky. Take a hike, bozo.
FIRST DRAFT: Nadine swats at him. Mike braces for a powerful blow only to fend off a feminine slap. ED
FIRST DRAFT: and NORMA walk in the front door.
FIRST DRAFT: Ed, get over here, this kid's trying to molest me.
FIRST DRAFT: What's she doing here?
FIRST DRAFT: #2.022
FIRST DRAFT: 4. CONTINUED:
FIRST DRAFT: Nadine?
FIRST DRAFT: Put those muscles that aren't between your ears to work
FIRST DRAFT: and give this punk the heave-ho.
FIRST DRAFT: Mike, Ed, and Norma stare at her.
FIRST DRAFT: Norma, if you don't mind, Ed and I have business to talk
FIRST DRAFT: about. Not that it isn't just peachy to see you.
FIRST DRAFT: Nadine pauses to look around the living room. As if to see it for the first time.
FIRST DRAFT: Hey. Where're my drape runners?
FIRST DRAFT: A beat. Ed steps forward. Gulp.
FIRST DRAFT: Nadine, how old are you?
FIRST DRAFT: What kind of stupid question is that?
FIRST DRAFT: Humor me. How old are you?
FIRST DRAFT: Thirty-seven, you moron.
FIRST DRAFT: Good answer.
FIRST DRAFT: 5. EXT. WOODS - NIGHT
FIRST DRAFT: Pete Martell's pickup is stopped on the side of the road.

FIRST DRAFT: Plenty of time.
FIRST DRAFT: He watches Annie come to from the chloroform.
FIRST DRAFT: Hello, sleepy head.
FIRST DRAFT: Boo!
FIRST DRAFT: Who?
FIRST DRAFT: Think of me as cancer. Or a heinous virus. Something
FIRST DRAFT: you can die from - horribly.
FIRST DRAFT: I am about to cow you for your own mortification.
FIRST DRAFT: Windom Earle.
FIRST DRAFT: She turns away. Earle reaches over. Pulls her hand from her pocket. A rosary is in her hand.
FIRST DRAFT: Oh, man, what a cheater! Sister Mary Holy Water crams
FIRST DRAFT: for finals.
FIRST DRAFT: (grabs the rosary and tosses it out the window,
FIRST DRAFT: slides closer to her)
FIRST DRAFT: Hey, you want to know something? Cooper's birthday is
FIRST DRAFT: April 19th, 1956. That means his moon is in Aries. Get
FIRST DRAFT: it?
FIRST DRAFT: This is lost on Annie. Earle goes into a rage.
FIRST DRAFT: You don't get it, do you, you pathetic little professional
FIRST DRAFT: shut in.
FIRST DRAFT: On the other hand, I've just spent two weeks in a cabin
FIRST DRAFT: with a smelly head of cabbage.
FIRST DRAFT: Has anyone ever told you you look a lot better than Leo
FIRST DRAFT: Johnson? Smell better too.
FIRST DRAFT: #2.022
FIRST DRAFT: 6. CONTINUED:
FIRST DRAFT: If you're going to kill me why don't you get it over with?
FIRST DRAFT: Oh, we have much bigger plans than that, my pretty.
FIRST DRAFT: Earle reaches below his seat, takes out the Miss Twin Peaks crown and places it on her head.
FIRST DRAFT: He kisses her passionately. She struggles. Earle laughs.
FIRST DRAFT: I tell ya, doll, if I was ten years younger and could find
FIRST DRAFT: the heater in this truck - boy, oh, boy. Having some fun
FIRST DRAFT: now.
FIRST DRAFT: He opens the truck door.
FIRST DRAFT: Won't you join me for a gambol in the grove?
FIRST DRAFT: He drags Annie out of the truck, and into the woods.
FIRST DRAFT: 7. EXT. ROAD IN THE WOODS - NIGHT
FIRST DRAFT: Truman's Cruiser skids to a stop behind Pete's pickup. Cooper runs to the truck, feels the
FIRST DRAFT: hood.
FIRST DRAFT: Still hot. They're close.
FIRST DRAFT: Andy, we've found the truck, get the patrol up here I want
FIRST DRAFT: the search centered from where we are now.
FIRST DRAFT: There's a short cut to the Grove up through here.
FIRST DRAFT: Cooper checks his watch.
FIRST DRAFT: 11:45.
FIRST DRAFT: We still got time, Coop.
FIRST DRAFT: To fear the worst often causes the worst. He's going to
FIRST DRAFT: #2.022
FIRST DRAFT: 7. CONTINUED:
FIRST DRAFT: terrify her, Harry. He did it to me. It's what he did to
FIRST DRAFT: Caroline. Face to face with all that's intolerable. All
FIRST DRAFT: that is evil.
FIRST DRAFT: He can't terrify anybody with a bullet between his eyes.
FIRST DRAFT: It's this way.
FIRST DRAFT: I'm right with you, Harry.
FIRST DRAFT: 8. EXT. THE WOODS, GLASTONBURY GROVE - NIGHT
FIRST DRAFT: Earle and Annie enter the circle of twelve trees. Then Earle circles her, stalking.
FIRST DRAFT: What are we doing here?
FIRST DRAFT: A momentary pause in limbo, dear. Please be patient.
FIRST DRAFT: Pity young Dale will miss all the fun. I always felt we
FIRST DRAFT: were sort of Lodge Brothers.
FIRST DRAFT: He'll find you. He'll come for me.
FIRST DRAFT: Do you see him anywhere? Huh? Huh?
FIRST DRAFT: Annie seems very calm, closes her eyes, whispers prayers to herself.
FIRST DRAFT: Prayers? What a revolting development.
FIRST DRAFT: Earle checks his watch. Frustrated. She's not scaring.
FIRST DRAFT: 9. EXT. WOODS - NIGHT
FIRST DRAFT: Truman and Cooper move quickly along a path.
FIRST DRAFT: Harry, all my skills, intuitions and dreams have led me
FIRST DRAFT: #2.022
FIRST DRAFT: 9. CONTINUED:
FIRST DRAFT: to the threshold of what is completely unknown. Led me
FIRST DRAFT: in a direction I never could really see. In spite of Earle's
FIRST DRAFT: prideful insanity. In spite of my best reasoning, only one
FIRST DRAFT: truth is clear. Whatever is, is right.
FIRST DRAFT: I'll take it from here, Harry. Alone. Cover me.
FIRST DRAFT: This is how it's supposed to be.
FIRST DRAFT: Truman stops. Realizes the truth of what he's saying.
FIRST DRAFT: Go. Go.
FIRST DRAFT: Cooper races ahead.
FIRST DRAFT: 10. EXT. GLASTONBURY GROVE - NIGHT
FIRST DRAFT: Earle and Annie in the dark grove.
FIRST DRAFT: You and I have an appointment at the end of the world.
FIRST DRAFT: "Toot, toot, 'board." This where it ends and the fun
FIRST DRAFT: begins. Get ready for first class despondency and
FIRST DRAFT: madness. The bewitching hour looms brightly.
FIRST DRAFT: If only Young Dale had lived to see it.
FIRST DRAFT: He's not dead.
FIRST DRAFT: Oh, Cooper's dead, alright. Gone and soon forgotten.
FIRST DRAFT: Good riddance to bad rubbish. Didn't I mention it? I
FIRST DRAFT: meticulously splattered his brains across the back of the
FIRST DRAFT: Roadhouse just before we left.
FIRST DRAFT: Poor studious little Dale. Never saw it coming. Not
FIRST DRAFT: even time for one of his pithy observations. You see, he
FIRST DRAFT: was too busy looking after you. Left himself wide open.
FIRST DRAFT: No... no....
FIRST DRAFT: Same thing happened the last time, when he fell in love
FIRST DRAFT: #2.022
FIRST DRAFT: 10. CONTINUED:
FIRST DRAFT: with my wife -
FIRST DRAFT: I took the boy right to the edge that time, opened him up
FIRST DRAFT: like a zipper. Six months to put back all the pieces -
FIRST DRAFT: Caroline, the unfaithful whore, she died quickly. Much
FIRST DRAFT: better than she deserved. Don't be so prissy. There's
FIRST DRAFT: nothing serious in mortality. Renown and grace come
FIRST DRAFT: afterward. In fact, they come right here. Here in this
FIRST DRAFT: place the nectar of life will be drawn.
FIRST DRAFT: Earle moves towards her. Annie screams, terrified. Behind her the doorway to the Lodge
FIRST DRAFT: begins to open, a hole in space. Earle is crazed with joy. A benediction.
FIRST DRAFT: "I tell you they have not died. Their hands clasp yours
FIRST DRAFT: and mine."
FIRST DRAFT: Annie turns and seems to be trying to run away, getting nowhere.
INTERCUT: 
INTERCUT: 11. ANNIE'S POV
INTERCUT: A kindly smiling MOTHER SUPERIOR NUN seems to welcome her ... Annie moves
INTERCUT: towards her, sobbing ... the Nun turns into Earle, who grabs her by the wrists and pulls her

INTERCUT: ... runs into the grove.

INTERCUT: 13. COOPER'S POV
INTERCUT: Windom, not dressed in costume, pulls Annie through the hole.

FADE OUT: 15. EXT. GLASTONBURY GROVE - NIGHT
FADE OUT: Truman stands alone in the circular grove waiting for what he doesn't know. Andy runs up
FADE OUT: behind him.
FADE OUT: Agent Cooper ... Agent Cooper.
FADE OUT: This scares the hell out of Truman. Andy notices the horse costume leaning against a tree.
FADE OUT: Sheriff, look.
FADE OUT: Stay away from that, Andy.
FADE OUT: But Andy is already over there.
FADE OUT: No. No. There's a note in the horse's mouth.
FADE OUT: Truman goes cautiously to him. Andy takes out the note and a net drops on top of him.
FADE OUT: What's the note say?
FADE OUT: "Don't look a gift horse in the mouth."
FADE OUT: 16. INT. EARLE'S CABIN - NIGHT
FADE OUT: Leo the prisoner sits there with the string holding the bag of spiders. He tries to yell for help
FADE OUT: and the string begins to slide through his teeth. He chomps down harder on it.
FADE OUT: He tries something else. He slides the chair out from under him. It falls away but he has no
FADE OUT: more room, has gained nothing. He is left in a squat with no support.
FADE OUT: 17. EXT. BLUE PINE LODGE - DAY
FADE OUT: #2.022 Revised 2-28-91, BLUE
FADE OUT: 18. INT. BLUE PINE LODGE - DAY
FADE OUT: Morning. ANDREW PACKARD tip-toes through the lodge to the mysterious key enshrined
FADE OUT: beneath the glass bell jar atop Catherine's desk.
FADE OUT: I've seen this somewhere...
FADE OUT: Andrew has an idea. He rifles through the desk, finds a large ring of keys, tagged for easy
FADE OUT: identification. Mill Office. Cadillac. Tool Shed. And last... Twin Peaks Savings and Loan. He
FADE OUT: lifts the jar, fingers the key, holds it up for closer inspection, compares it to the first. Same
FADE OUT: make, same model.
FADE OUT: The Savings and Loan!
FADE OUT: Just then: the sound of the kitchen door OPENING. Andrew tears the tag off the second key,
FADE OUT: places it under the bell jar, [pockets the first. He looks up to see Pete, eyeing him with
FADE OUT: disapproval.] And pockets the first. Andrew hurries out of the room. A beat. CATHERINE
FADE OUT: enters, tip-toes like her brother toward the desk. She looks left and right, makes certain no one
FADE OUT: is watching. Then gently lifts the glass bell jar.
FADE OUT: 19. INT. HAYWARD HOUSE - DAY
FADE OUT: DONNA HAYWARD carries a small suitcase into the living room, eyes red from crying.
FADE OUT: EILEEN HAYWARD follows in her wheelchair.
FADE OUT: Listen to me. Please.
FADE OUT: I've already heard enough. Okay, Mom?
FADE OUT: But if you'd just let me explain -
FADE OUT: Both pause. BEN HORNE stands in the center of the living room.
FADE OUT: Donna.
FADE OUT: Leave me alone.
FADE OUT: Donna, it's not your parents' fault. It's mine.
FADE OUT: #2.022
FADE OUT: 19. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: My parents? Who exactly is that supposed to be?
FADE OUT: I only wanted to do good. To be good.
FADE OUT: Tell the hardest truth first. That's what I did. And it
FADE OUT: seemed appropriate, it felt good to tell the truth at last.
FADE OUT: But I was wrong. You were all better off when I devoted
FADE OUT: my time to lying, cheating, and stealing. And as for
FADE OUT: me...
FADE OUT: Doc Hayward enters, weary, holding his medicine bag, and sees this tableau before him.
FADE OUT: Hayward darkens.
FADE OUT: Oh, dammit, Ben...
FADE OUT: Will, I have agonized and I have meditated and I have
FADE OUT: prayed.
FADE OUT: Ben, please.
FADE OUT: Donna, go to your room.
FADE OUT: Ben, I warned you. Get out of my house.
FADE OUT: Can you forgive me, Will? After all I've done to you?
FADE OUT: Forgive me. Please forgive me.
FADE OUT: Ben steps to him, as if to embrace. Hayward grabs Ben by the lapels, forces him from the
FADE OUT: room. Chaos follows.
FADE OUT: Will!
FADE OUT: Leave my family alone!!
FADE OUT: DADDY!
FADE OUT: Hayward shoves Ben toward the door. Ben reaches a hand toward Donna, desperate, as if her
FADE OUT: #2.022
FADE OUT: 19. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: shout was meant for him. Ben falls, STRIKES his head on a coffee table. Donna SCREAMS.
FADE OUT: Hayward kneels beside him.
FADE OUT: Oh, Lord...
FADE OUT: Donna, get my bag.
FADE OUT: DONNA!!
FADE OUT: Donna takes one last look at Ben, the pool of blood forming beneath his head. And races from
FADE OUT: the room. Eileen wheels closer, pales. Hayward kneels an prays.
FADE OUT: I'm sorry, Ben. My God I'm sorry. Ben, Ben can you hear
FADE OUT: me...?
FADE OUT: HOLD ON Ben's face for a beat. Silent.
FADE OUT: 20. INT. THE BLACK LODGE
FADE OUT: START CLOSE on Agent Cooper, his face filled with wonder. He occupies a dark space,
FADE OUT: limitless.
FADE OUT: Annie?
FADE OUT: His voice echoes. No reply. Then a bright lights shines, and the GUARDIAN, cowled in
FADE OUT: shadow, stands before him.
FADE OUT: Where am I?
FADE OUT: A RIPPING sound. A FLASH of bright light.
SHOCK CUT TO: 
SHOCK CUT TO: 21. INT. MOTEL RECEPTION.
SHOCK CUT TO: SUDDENLY Cooper finds himself in a shabby motel office, a raging wind outside,
SHOCK CUT TO: slamming doors, shaking windows. At the reception desk, a CLERK, wearing a bizarre
SHOCK CUT TO: orthopedic brace, a tracheotomy plug in his throat. The clerk speaks, as if to answer Cooper's
SHOCK CUT TO: question:
SHOCK CUT TO: Home.
SHOCK CUT TO: #2.022
SHOCK CUT TO: 21. CONTINUED:
SHOCK CUT TO: Is this the Black Lodge?
SHOCK CUT TO: Name, please.
SHOCK CUT TO: Suddenly ten years old. A smallish boy in shorts and shirt.
SHOCK CUT TO: Dale Cooper.
SHOCK CUT TO: The desk clerk nods, inscribes. Cooper has returned to his adult self. The change a flashing
SHOCK CUT TO: metamorphosis, back and forth. Cooper reorients, reacts. The desk clerk has VANISHED.
SHOCK CUT TO: An OLD MAN stands in his stead. Solid, kind in aspect and appearance. Cooper pales.
SHOCK CUT TO: Father...?
SHOCK CUT TO: There are fresh towels in every room.
SHOCK CUT TO: Father, listen to me. I need your help.
SHOCK CUT TO: Cable TV. Including three adult entertainment channels.
SHOCK CUT TO: Please.
SHOCK CUT TO: And a fruit basket with our compliments.
SHOCK CUT TO: FATHER!
SHOCK CUT TO: A beat.
SHOCK CUT TO: You will need a key.
SHOCK CUT TO: The old man takes a key from a rack, holds it out to Agent Cooper.
SHOCK CUT TO: I love you.
SHOCK CUT TO: #2.022
SHOCK CUT TO: 21. CONTINUED:
SHOCK CUT TO: Cooper reaches out to receive it. He touches the key, and...

SHOCK CUT TO: 22. EXT. WOODS - DAY
SHOCK CUT TO: Major Briggs leads Deputy Hawk through the woods.
SHOCK CUT TO: I remember sunlight pouring through tall trees...
SHOCK CUT TO: A common sight in these woods, Major.
SHOCK CUT TO: I can smell it.
SHOCK CUT TO: What?
SHOCK CUT TO: The drug Windom Earle gave me has apparently
SHOCK CUT TO: heightened my sense data. Shapes, colors, smells. I am
SHOCK CUT TO: bombarded, and yet...it's as if my brain were better able
SHOCK CUT TO: to interpret and define reality.
SHOCK CUT TO: Wow.
SHOCK CUT TO: You might want to have Doc runs some more tests when
SHOCK CUT TO: we get back.
SHOCK CUT TO: No, no. I'm fine. I imagine this must have been what the
SHOCK CUT TO: Sixites were like.
SHOCK CUT TO: Follow me.
SHOCK CUT TO: Briggs now trots through the pines, a man on a mission. His brain filled with bright new
SHOCK CUT TO: information. Hawk follows.
SHOCK CUT TO: My God the flowers, can you hear them?
SHOCK CUT TO: No.
SHOCK CUT TO: The wind passing through their petals has a distinctive
SHOCK CUT TO: #2.022
SHOCK CUT TO: 22. CONTINUED:
SHOCK CUT TO: quality quite different from the pine boughs above us.
SHOCK CUT TO: Look. There we are. This way.
SHOCK CUT TO: Briggs bounds into the distance.
SHOCK CUT TO: 23. INT. EARLE'S CABIN - DAY
SHOCK CUT TO: Leo furiously works at the string in his mouth, trying to increase his grip on the lifeline. His
SHOCK CUT TO: hands tug at the shackles, remain bound. Leo looks at the string with crossed eyes, sees that his
SHOCK CUT TO: saliva is causing it to weaken and fray. Leo emits a little humming moan.
SHOCK CUT TO: Suddenly: FOOTSTEPS outside the cabin. Hawk and Major Briggs charging forward. Leo
SHOCK CUT TO: reacts, hopeful. The door BURSTS open, Hawk enters first, gun in hand. Briggs follows. Leo
SHOCK CUT TO: can't help it, he sighs, smiles -
SHOCK CUT TO: Hi -
SHOCK CUT TO: - WHAAAAAA!!
SHOCK CUT TO: 24. EXT. EARLE'S CABIN - DAY
SHOCK CUT TO: The cabin exterior. Leo SCREAMING. The SOUND of Hawk and Briggs rushing to the

SHOCK CUT TO: As a matter of fact, there is.
SHOCK CUT TO: Audrey pulls a long length of chain from the bag, runs it through the vault bars.
SHOCK CUT TO: I want you to call the Twin Peaks Gazette.
SHOCK CUT TO: Er, Miss Horne...?
SHOCK CUT TO: Ask for Dwayne Milford Jr. He's the Editor.
SHOCK CUT TO: Audrey wraps the chain around her waist, attaching her torso to the vault bars. She removes a
SHOCK CUT TO: wicked looking padlock from the valise.
SHOCK CUT TO: Dwayne Milford Jr...
SHOCK CUT TO: Miss Horne, if I may ask a simple question -
SHOCK CUT TO: Tell him that Audrey Horne has chained herself to the
SHOCK CUT TO: Twin Peaks Savings and Loan vault to protest their
SHOCK CUT TO: financial ties to the Ghostwood Development Project,
SHOCK CUT TO: and that she intends to stay here until a town meeting is
SHOCK CUT TO: held to debate the future of our environment, and,

SHOCK CUT TO: Yes, Dell. It's me. Alive.
SHOCK CUT TO: You look fabulous. And the funeral, well, the flowers, the
SHOCK CUT TO: boy's choir, it...
SHOCK CUT TO: I was hoping you could do me a small favor.
SHOCK CUT TO: Anything.
SHOCK CUT TO: Does this look familiar to you?
SHOCK CUT TO: It's one of our safety deposit keys.
SHOCK CUT TO: Shall we?
SHOCK CUT TO: Of course. There is one small problem...
SHOCK CUT TO: Andrew  stops short, sees Audrey chained to the vault bars.
SHOCK CUT TO: Hello, young lady.
SHOCK CUT TO: Hello.
SHOCK CUT TO: Why are you chained to the bank vault?
SHOCK CUT TO: #2.022 Revised 2-28-91, BLUE
SHOCK CUT TO: 27. CONTINUED:
SHOCK CUT TO: Civil disobedience.

SHOCK CUT TO: I see no problem here...
SHOCK CUT TO: If you'll excuse us, please?
SHOCK CUT TO: Sure.
SHOCK CUT TO: Mibbler sighs, reaches for a large ring of keys, opens the vault door. Audrey scoots forward,
SHOCK CUT TO: allowing Andrew room to enter.
SHOCK CUT TO: Did you call the Gazette yet? The Sheriff too, probably.

INTERCUT: Near the center of the grove the air seem to shift shape, move and alter.
INTERCUT: Truman stands, moves closer.
INTERCUT: A GLEAMING WHITE SHIELD appears in the oscillating air and from behind it a hand
INTERCUT: holding a SILVER SWORD.
INTERCUT: Truman is mesmerized.
INTERCUT: He now sees that holding the shield and sword is a tall, dark WOMAN, wearing a glittering
INTERCUT: chain mail. She sees Truman, holds the sword out towards him.
INTERCUT: Oh my God... oh my God.
INTERCUT: #2.022
INTERCUT: 32. CONTINUED:
INTERCUT: In a loud snap, image of the woman vanishes and we ...
INTERCUT: 33. A BLACK CORRIDOR
INTERCUT: A dark, ominous version of the Great Northern. Everything in black and white, including the
INTERCUT: checkboard floor. Cooper turns a corner and starts towards us, moving cautiously, glancing in
INTERCUT: all directions.
INTERCUT: Looking ahead, he sees someone approaching him. He moves closer and realizes it's a version
INTERCUT: of himself, dressed identically, identical in every detail, but upon closer scrutiny realizes the
INTERCUT: figure's face is smooth and blank, his eyes gleaming, lifeless and black as ebony, no white
INTERCUT: cornea visible.
INTERCUT: A door swings open to Cooper's left and another to his right. Looking through the left door he
INTERCUT: sees Windom Earle far down a corridor, beckoning to him.
INTERCUT: Looking through the right door he sees Annie.
INTERCUT: Annie!
INTERCUT: The door SLAMS in his face.
INTERCUT: #2.022
INTERCUT: 34. INT. BLACK CORRIDOR
INTERCUT: Cooper struggles with the door, can't open it.
INTERCUT: WINDOM EARLE'S VOICE
INTERCUT: You're going about this all wrong, Dale.
INTERCUT: Cooper stops, tries to locate the source of the voice.
INTERCUT: WINDOM EARLE'S VOICE
INTERCUT: We'll profit not at all from resisting what there is to
INTERCUT: experience here. That much I do know. Still, an entire
INTERCUT: life of research and contemplation can't begin to prepare
INTERCUT: one for the actual experience of being here.
INTERCUT: Where are we?
INTERCUT: WINDOM EARLE'S VOICE
INTERCUT: Speaking for myself, I'm up here. No, up here.
INTERCUT: Cooper looks up. Earle is floating ten feet off the ground some distance away.
INTERCUT: Think of us as astronauts. And when you do, think of us
INTERCUT: fondly. I could hazard a guess at the physics but why
INTERCUT: spoil the fun?
INTERCUT: What is this place?
INTERCUT: Where do you think we are, dummy?
INTERCUT: The Black Lodge.
INTERCUT: Earle points the shock remote at him and presses the button: a burst of energy hits Cooper and a
INTERCUT: loud BUZZING sound is heard.
INTERCUT: Good answer. I've always hoped my endless hours of
INTERCUT: mentoring might CONTRIBUTE to the development
INTERCUT: of a fertile MIND. You were such a dullard, Coopy, such
INTERCUT: an earnest, plodding, do-gooding Eagle Scout - it was
INTERCUT: all I could do sometimes to keep myself from
INTERCUT: #2.022
INTERCUT: 34. CONTINUED:
INTERCUT: GENERAL PRINCIPLE!
INTERCUT: You were too smart for me, Windom.
INTERCUT: Don't prostrate yourself, dear boy. You're a tool, a useful
INTERCUT: one, granted, but it can't very well be said that we play in
INTERCUT: the same league, now can it?
INTERCUT: You were always looking for this.
INTERCUT: That's right. And what were you looking for, in your
INTERCUT: endless perambulations? Oh, I know all about those three
INTERCUT: "missing years," Tibet and your pathetic eager-beaver
INTERCUT: globetrotring quest for enlightenment. In that one respect
INTERCUT: we aren't so radically different. Perhaps that's why I've
INTERCUT: tolerated you for as long as I did. Because I knew that,
INTERCUT: one day, you would prove useful.
INTERCUT: Useful for what?
INTERCUT: Why do you think, silly boy? For FUN.
INTERCUT: He points the remote at him again and presses the button. A blinding flash of light.
INTERCUT: 35. INT. RED ROOM
INTERCUT: Cooper comes to, lying on the floor of the red room. He rouses himself, looks around.
INTERCUT: Hearing someone humming.
INTERCUT: Where am I?
INTERCUT: A crude, hand-painted sign falls into view. It reads: PITTSBURGH, STUPID. The sign flies
INTERCUT: up out of sight.
INTERCUT: Cooper locates the source of the humming: a WOMAN in a pretty dress stands with her back
INTERCUT: to him, at a sink in a small kitchen area.
INTERCUT: #2.022
INTERCUT: 35. CONTINUED:
INTERCUT: Caroline ... oh my God ... Caroline?
INTERCUT: No response. The humming grows louder. Cooper advances on the figure.
INTERCUT: Caroline?
INTERCUT: The humming stops. The figure tenses but doesn't turn. Cooper moves closer.
INTERCUT: Caroline, it's me ... it's Dale.
INTERCUT: Cooper is right behind the figure. He slowly reaches a hand out, touches the figure tentatively
INTERCUT: on the shoulder. We hear a low GROWLING and then the figure turns. It's Annie. As
INTERCUT: Caroline.
INTERCUT: Dale, oh my God, you startled me. I thought it might be
INTERCUT: Windom.
INTERCUT: Thank God you're here, I've missed you so much.
INTERCUT: I've missed you too.
INTERCUT: I've been so frightened. I had the most terrible dream.
INTERCUT: What was it?
INTERCUT: I saw the face of the man. The face of the man who killed
INTERCUT: me.
INTERCUT: Cooper draws back.
INTERCUT: I know who it is. It's the same man who kidnapped me,
INTERCUT: the man who gave me the drug. It was Windom, Dale. It
INTERCUT: was him all along.
INTERCUT: Cooper stares at her.
INTERCUT: What's the matter? Don't you believe me? It's my
INTERCUT: #2.022
INTERCUT: 35. CONTINUED:
INTERCUT: husband. He's the killer. He's the one I saw. We've got
INTERCUT: to stop him.
INTERCUT: You said the face of the man who killed you.
INTERCUT: Did I? You must be mistaken. I'm alive.
INTERCUT: Pause. Cooper seems close to tears.
INTERCUT: ... Annie?
INTERCUT: Who's Annie?
INTERCUT: Cooper looks around. Speaks to the unseen Earle.
INTERCUT: Leave her alone. Tell me what you want, just leave her
INTERCUT: alone.
INTERCUT: 36. A spotlight comes up on Earle, in top hat and tails. Big band music. Earle sings.
INTERCUT: "Long ago a glimpse of stocking was looked on as
INTERCUT: something, now Heaven knows, anything goes."
INTERCUT: The light blacks out. Cooper turns back the other way and sees ...
INTERCUT: 37. A SHADOWY FIGURE ...
INTERCUT: ...lurking behind Annie, in a slouch hat, holding a long, thin gleaming medical instrument.
INTERCUT: Windom...
INTERCUT: Windom looks up from under the hat and winks at him, then directs Cooper's attention to
INTERCUT: another part of the room where ...
INTERCUT: 38. A distraught Earle ...
INTERCUT: ... sits with two POLICE OFFICERS, describing a crime scene.
INTERCUT: I came in the door. There was blood on the kitchen
INTERCUT: #2.022
INTERCUT: 38. CONTINUED:
INTERCUT: floor. I followed it into the living room ... that's where
INTERCUT: they were lying ...
INTERCUT: Cooper looks over and sees ... Annie, pale and quite obviously dead, lying in the arms of
INTERCUT: Cooper's "double" ...
INTERCUT: I thought they were both dead. I knew that because I
INTERCUT: stabbed them myself.
INTERCUT: Earle reveals the medical instrument. Blood on its tip. The double opens its black, lifeless
INTERCUT: eyes and stares at Cooper.
INTERCUT: Don't do this. Don't hurt her. Tell me what you want!
INTERCUT: 39. THE BLACK CORRIDOR
INTERCUT: Cooper and Earle are standing side by side.
INTERCUT: That's more like it. Sorry to put you through that, old
INTERCUT: boy, but I did need to secure your cooperation. Don't
INTERCUT: worry about your girlfriend. She's alive, of course -
INTERCUT: What do you want?
INTERCUT: Actually, I need you to volunteer for something. A
INTERCUT: mission for a man of singular quality -
INTERCUT: Tell me.
INTERCUT: Come along with me.
INTERCUT: He opens a door. Gestures for Cooper to precede him. Cooper does. Earle follows.
INTERCUT: 40. NT. THRONE ROOM
INTERCUT: A black and white doctor's office. Plain. Non-threatening. Two steps lead up to a dentist's
INTERCUT: chair on a elevated rostrum.
INTERCUT: #2.022
INTERCUT: 40. CONTINUED:
INTERCUT: Some people, I won't name names, they call the place
INTERCUT: Hell. I don't have to tell you what they call the other
INTERCUT: place. Needless to say, they've got it all backwards.
INTERCUT: This is the place of power. The other's a revolting
INTERCUT: mixture of milk-curdling sentimentality and bland
INTERCUT: acquiescence to the cosmic equivalent of good table
INTERCUT: manners. See, there's Annie.
INTERCUT: He points casually to a medical supply cabinet, where Annie is trapped, alive, behind glass.
INTERCUT: In case of emergency, break glass.
INTERCUT: Here's the deal, Dale. Throne room. Windom.
INTERCUT: Windom sits on throne. Windom king. Windom happy.
INTERCUT: Problem: Windom need to make deposit first. That's
INTERCUT: how it works. Windom can't make deposit all by
INTERCUT: himself. Windom un-happy.
INTERCUT: What kind of deposit?
INTERCUT: Here's where the designers show their ingenuity. In return
INTERCUT: for the best seat in the house they want something in
INTERCUT: return. Guess what: voluntarily offered, no strings
INTERCUT: attached, by its owner and operator ... the soul of a good
INTERCUT: human being. Naturally something I have in very short
INTERCUT: supply.
INTERCUT: That's where you come in.
INTERCUT: You'll let her go. You'll let her live.
INTERCUT: Why, Dale, it's as if you read my mind.
INTERCUT: All right, let's do it. Now. Fast.
INTERCUT: Lovely. Stand over there.
INTERCUT: A light illuminates a single square of the black and white checkerboard floor. Cooper moves
INTERCUT: #2.022
INTERCUT: 40. CONTINUED:
INTERCUT: to it. Another light illuminates the dentist chair. A third hits Annie. Everything else goes
INTERCUT: BLACK. Earle moves to the dentist chair, sits and sing happily.
INTERCUT: "Back in the saddle again, out where an Indian's your
INTERCUT: friend, where everything is green and you can pee right
INTERCUT: into the stream ... back in the saddle again."
INTERCUT: A rumbling SOUND. Something approaching. Earle sits back and claps his hands like an
INTERCUT: excited child. A DOOR OPENS. A MAN in a version of a white dentist's smock enters,
INTERCUT: pushing a covered tray. We can't see his face. He stops next to the chair.
INTERCUT: Oh goody.
INTERCUT: Suddenly clamps spring out of the arms and legs of the chair. Another slithers around
INTERCUT: Windom's neck while yet another gags him.
INTERCUT: The Dentist uncovers the table, revealing an array of loathsome medical instruments. The
INTERCUT: Dentist picks up a particularly nasty one, a huge syringe, and turns to face them ... it's killer
INTERCUT: BOB. Earle squirms, screams. We hear Bob's voice, but his lips don't move.
INTERCUT: BOB'S VOICE
INTERCUT: If you know what's good for you, and you do, don't
INTERCUT: move.
INTERCUT: The fool broke the rules: it's really no good if you don't
INTERCUT: volunteer. Doesn't count if you're coerced. He'll have to
INTERCUT: be punished and he will be ...
INTERCUT: Of course that doesn't mean we have to let you go. This
INTERCUT: is for extracting.
INTERCUT: Bob grins and is about to use the syringe on Cooper when a HAND reaches in and stops him.
INTERCUT: They both turn to look and see ... Laura. Alarm on. Bob's face. A SOUND of two
INTERCUT: tremendous energies colliding. A WHITE LIGHT fills the room. Cooper looks to Annie,
INTERCUT: who's calling for him silently.
FADE TO WHITE: 
FADE TO WHITE: 41. EXT. WOODS - DAY
FADE TO WHITE: Fighting off fatigue, Truman moves around, stretching. Looking back to the grove he sees
FADE TO WHITE: someone lying in its center. Truman runs to them. It's Cooper and Annie, both unconscious.
FADE TO WHITE: #2.022
FADE TO WHITE: 41. CONTINUED:
FADE TO WHITE: Cooper? Cooper!
FADE TO WHITE: Andy, get that ambulance up here right now - Cooper?
FADE TO WHITE: He realizes there's blood on Annie's blouse. Cooper opens his eyes.
FADE TO WHITE: Coop, you okay? Coop? You okay?
FADE TO WHITE: Cooper slowly shakes his head and closes his eyes again. SOUND of a siren in the distance.
FADE TO WHITE: 42. INT. GREAT NORTHERN COOPER'S ROOM - NIGHT
FADE TO WHITE: Wearing pajamas, Cooper lies in bed. Doc Hayward and Truman attend him. Cooper opens
FADE TO WHITE: his eyes again.
FADE TO WHITE: Here he is.
FADE TO WHITE: Coop ...
FADE TO WHITE: Where am I?
FADE TO WHITE: Your room at the Great Northern. Annie's gonna be okay.
FADE TO WHITE: She's in the hospital.
FADE TO WHITE: Pause.
FADE TO WHITE: You've had quite a shock. Everything checks out, though.
FADE TO WHITE: You're going to be fine.
FADE TO WHITE: I can't tell you how worried we were. I saw you
FADE TO WHITE: disappear. God almighty ...
FADE TO WHITE: I'd like to brush my teeth.
FADE TO WHITE: Okay, sure, good.
FADE TO WHITE: Let me help you up.
FADE TO WHITE: #2.022
FADE TO WHITE: 42. CONTINUED:
FADE TO WHITE: They help him to his feet.
FADE TO WHITE: Thank you.
FADE TO WHITE: Cooper walks slowly to the bathroom and closes the door.
FADE TO WHITE: 43. INT. COOPER'S BATHROOM - NIGHT
FADE TO WHITE: Cooper looks at the sink, at his personal effects, he picks up the toothbrush, squeezes some
FADE TO WHITE: toothpaste on it and lifts it to his mouth. He holds it in front of his mouth, looks into the
FADE TO WHITE: mirror and smiles brightly. Looking into the mirror, staring back at him, is the face of Bob.
