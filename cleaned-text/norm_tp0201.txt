REVISIONS: 1. EXT. GREAT NORTHERN HOTEL - NIGHT
REVISIONS: 2. INT. GREAT NORTHERN CORRIDOR - NIGHT
REVISIONS: Looking through the open door into Cooper's room. COOPER lies still on the floor, flat on
REVISIONS: his back at the foot of the bed.
REVISIONS: Looking down the corridor, here comes a ROOM SERVICE WAITER, carrying a glass of
REVISIONS: warm milk on a tray. He stops at the open doorway, sees Cooper, knocks.
REVISIONS: Room service.
REVISIONS: No response. He enters cautiously.
REVISIONS: Cooper's eyes open. He looks up as the Waiter, who is no scholar.
REVISIONS: How you doin' down there?
REVISIONS: Cooper blinks a few times, dazed and disoriented. Pause.
REVISIONS: Warm milk.
REVISIONS: He proudly holds up the glass.
REVISIONS: Could you ... put it on the table?
REVISIONS: Sure.
REVISIONS: The Waiter gingerly steps around him and sets the glass of milk down on the table beside the
REVISIONS: phone receiver, from where he hears ...
REVISIONS: ANDY'S VOICE
REVISIONS: Hello? ... Agent Cooper? ... Agent Cooper?
REVISIONS: The Waiter looks down at Cooper, then decides to helpfully hang up the receiver.
REVISIONS: 2. CONTINUED:
REVISIONS: Hung it up for you.
REVISIONS: What's that?
REVISIONS: Hung it up. The phone.
REVISIONS: Oh.
REVISIONS: Thank you.
REVISIONS: No problem.
REVISIONS: The Waiter stands in front of him, holding the bill, takes out a pen. Cooper's attention drifts
REVISIONS: off him, drifts back.
REVISIONS: Yes?
REVISIONS: The Waiter holds out the bill and pen. Cooper takes them, holds them above his chest, trying
REVISIONS: to focus
REVISIONS: Does this include a gratuity?
REVISIONS: Yes sir.
REVISIONS: Cooper scrawls a signature. The Waiter takes back the bill and pen.
REVISIONS: That milk'll cool down on ya'.
REVISIONS: The Waiter smiles, backs up to the door, stops, grins, points a finger. He's figured it out.
REVISIONS: I heard about you.
REVISIONS: Cooper looks at him. The Waiter grins again, gives a small wave and a wink and moves off.
REVISIONS: We hear his footsteps move do, the coorridor. They stop. Slower footsteps come back.
REVISIONS: The Waiter peeks around the corner, looks at Cooper again, grins, shakes his head and
REVISIONS: moves off. The footsteps recede.
REVISIONS: 2.001 Revised 7-24-90, YELLOW
REVISIONS: 2. CONTINUED:
REVISIONS: Cooper takes a cautious deep breath. He closes his eyes, wincing in pain. He turns his head
REVISIONS: towards the bed, opens his eyes and slowly realizes that, looming above him, a GIANT is
REVISIONS: sitting on the foot of the bed looking down at him.
REVISIONS: The Giant appears to be at least eight feet tall. He's wearing dark pants, a white shirt rolled
REVISIONS: up at the sleeves and a slender black tie.
REVISIONS: I will tell you three things.
REVISIONS: If I tell them to you, and they come true, then will you
REVISIONS: believe me?
REVISIONS: Who are you?
REVISIONS: Think of me as a friend.
REVISIONS: Where did you come from?
REVISIONS: The question is: where have you gone?
REVISIONS: Cooper blinks, ponders.
REVISIONS: The first thing I will tell you is: "The man in the
REVISIONS: smiling bag."
REVISIONS: "Smiling bag."
REVISIONS: The second thing is: "The owls are not what you think."
REVISIONS: Cooper repeats the words, clinging to them.
REVISIONS: The third thing is: "He points without the proper chemical."
REVISIONS: Cooper repeats the phrase to himself.
REVISIONS: 2.001 Revised 7-24-90, YELLOW
REVISIONS: 2. CONTINUED:
REVISIONS: What, what does this mean?
REVISIONS: This is all I am permitted to say. If you find these
REVISIONS: things to be true, I will visit you again. We want to help
REVISIONS: you.
REVISIONS: Who's "we?"
REVISIONS: One last thing: Leo locked inside a hungry horse. By the
REVISIONS: way, you will require medical attention.
REVISIONS: Cooper looks down at his shirt. A bloodstain is slowly spreading across his midsection. He
REVISIONS: looks back. The Giant is gone. Cooper doesn't move.
REVISIONS: Holy jumpin' George.
REVISIONS: 3. EXT. ONE-EYED JACK'S - NIGHT
REVISIONS: 4. INT. ONE-EYED JACK'S BEDROOM NIGHT
REVISIONS: CLOSE on AUDREY'S eye, peering out from between the curtains, draped around the
REVISIONS: fourposter in her room. Audrey stands on the bed. There are two masks on the wall above
REVISIONS: the headboard.
REVISIONS: BEN HORNE enters the room, sees movement behind the curtains.
REVISIONS: Knock, knock.
REVISIONS: Knock. Knock.
REVISIONS: Who's there?
REVISIONS: The big bad wolf.
REVISIONS: 4. CONTINUED:
REVISIONS: Go away.
REVISIONS: Interesting.
REVISIONS: Come on, let's have a look at you.
REVISIONS: I'm shy.
REVISIONS: Didn't you know? Everybody's shy. Here at One-Eyed
REVISIONS: Jack's it's a transitory condition. And an occupational
REVISIONS: handicap.
REVISIONS: He tries to pry the curtain apart for a look, she snaps it shut. He takes out a cigar; having
REVISIONS: been through this before, he falls back on technique.
REVISIONS: But, consider; your first night in a new place, new
REVISIONS: surroundings, new people -
REVISIONS: New wardrobe -
REVISIONS: - naturally you are full of questions, anxieties. You're
REVISIONS: wondering "What's expected of me? how will I be
REVISIONS: received? will they ... like me?" I'm right, aren't I?
REVISIONS: Yes.
REVISIONS: Ben patrols the perimeter, toying with the curtains, as she moves with him, defending her
REVISIONS: translucent barrier, trying to anticipate his angle of attack.
REVISIONS: Let's examine these feelings, shall we? What are they if
REVISIONS: not the natural emotional processes of any living,
REVISIONS: breathing person who finds herself thrust ... into new
REVISIONS: circumstances?
REVISIONS: Could you repeat the question?
REVISIONS: 4. CONTINUED:
REVISIONS: You're nervous, you're shy, you're frightened: of course
REVISIONS: you are...
REVISIONS: How exactly new to all this are you?
REVISIONS: You might say ... brand new.
REVISIONS: Really.
REVISIONS: For instance, if I was a bar of soap, I'd still be wrapped
REVISIONS: in my package.
REVISIONS: Alright' fine, now I have to see you ...
REVISIONS: He puts his cigar in his mouth, tries to open the curtain again; she thwarts him. He thrusts a
REVISIONS: hand inside. She slaps it away.
REVISIONS: A vixen! What's your name?
REVISIONS: Queen of Diamonds.
REVISIONS: No, no, no, your real name.
REVISIONS: I'm not supposed to tell.
REVISIONS: Did they tell you who I was?
REVISIONS: The owner?
REVISIONS: That's right. Tell me your name.
REVISIONS: You wouldn't believe me.
REVISIONS: 4. CONTINUED:
REVISIONS: I'm a liberal thinker.
REVISIONS: Prudence.
REVISIONS: Prudence!
REVISIONS: I think you should go.
REVISIONS: Do you, Prudence?
REVISIONS: Yes I do. I really do.
REVISIONS: All right.
REVISIONS: She listens cautiously. Ben walks to the door, opens and closes it, tiptoes back into the room,
REVISIONS: towards the bed. He triumphantly throws the curtains open.
REVISIONS: 'Got you!
REVISIONS: She's hiding under the covers, a conspicuous lump. Ben advances.
REVISIONS: I'll huff ... and I'll puff ... and I'll blow your house
REVISIONS: down!
REVISIONS: He yanks the covers away. She's revealed: a mask covers her features.
REVISIONS: Aren't you ... something?
REVISIONS: He advances further. She retreats. He reaches for her, she slaps his hands away, grabs a
REVISIONS: pillow and whacks him across the head. He laughs. She's backed against the wall. He reaches
REVISIONS: for her mask.
REVISIONS: Please ... I have to ... see you ...
REVISIONS: His hand reaches the mask. An urgent knock at the door. Ben hesitates. Another knock.
REVISIONS: 4. CONTINUED:
REVISIONS: JERRY HORNE'S VOICE
REVISIONS: Ben, it's Jer! Brother Ben, we've got a situation!
REVISIONS: So have I.
REVISIONS: JERRY HORNE'S VOICE
REVISIONS: Ben, it's the M-I-L-L! And we got a big S-N-A-G!
REVISIONS: Ring a bell?
REVISIONS: Alas, I do have a situation.
REVISIONS: Gee, that's too bad.
REVISIONS: I like you. You know how to interest a man. That's half
REVISIONS: the battle. You've got quite a future in front of you.
REVISIONS: That's what everyone keeps telling me.
REVISIONS: JERRY'S VOICE
REVISIONS: Ben, I'm gonna count to three -
REVISIONS: Coming, Jer!
REVISIONS: Prudence, I'm leaving now, but I'm going to get myself
REVISIONS: back up here to see you right away. And next time we'll
REVISIONS: play a different game. I'll make the rules. A fun game.
REVISIONS: You'll like it. Everybody wins.
REVISIONS: He drops some money the table, blows her a kiss and blows out of the room.
REVISIONS: Audrey lowers the mask. She's laughing silently, tears running down her face, close to the
REVISIONS: edge.
REVISIONS: 5. INT. BLACKIE'S OFFICE - NIGHT
REVISIONS: Ben and Jerry enter Blackie's office. BLACKIE sits behind her desk, looking worn and
REVISIONS: haggard. She has the shakes.
REVISIONS: 5. CONTINUED:
REVISIONS: How many blips are we dealing with?
REVISIONS: Two blips: blip number one, they contained the fire in
REVISIONS: the drying sheds -
REVISIONS: It didn't spread to the processing plant?
REVISIONS: Just the plywood building, not the main plant.
REVISIONS: Manageable. What's blip number two?
REVISIONS: Leo the Lip's in the hospital -
REVISIONS: As in morgue?
REVISIONS: That's a big N-O.
REVISIONS: Ben chews on that. Turns to Blackie.
REVISIONS: Keep an eye on that new girl. She didn't come across.
REVISIONS: This sounds like a job for Jerry Horne -
REVISIONS: Taking off his coat, Jerry starts for the door. Ben grabs him by the collar.
REVISIONS: Blackie, you're looking a little the worse for wear ...
REVISIONS: She shoots him a poisonous look. He takes a packet from his pocket.
REVISIONS: Would you like to fix yourself a cocktail? Or would
REVISIONS: you rather just say "no?"
REVISIONS: Bastard.
REVISIONS: 5. CONTINUED:
REVISIONS: What's that, Blackie?
REVISIONS: Please.
REVISIONS: And you used to be so pretty.
REVISIONS: Ben signals to Jerry, who exits. Ben moves to the door.
REVISIONS: PLEASE.
REVISIONS: Pretty ... please
REVISIONS: Ben tosses the packet onto the desk, shakes his head and exits. Blackie looks at the packet,
REVISIONS: opens a drawer , takes out a length of rubber tubing and sets
REVISIONS: it on the desk.
REVISIONS: 6. EXT. BURNED MILL - DAWN
REVISIONS: 7. INT. MILL - DAWN
REVISIONS: Details of the ravaged interior. A scorched moose head on a wall. A ruined office. Water
REVISIONS: and ash dripping into a tea cup. A blackened fire extinguisher,
REVISIONS: 8. EXT. MILL - DAWN
REVISIONS: PARAMEDICS wheel PETE MARTELL out of the mill, his face covered with an oxygen
REVISIONS: mask.
REVISIONS: They load Pete, into the back of an ambulance. SHELLY JOHNSON is already inside on
REVISIONS: another gurney, also taking oxygen. SHERIFF TRUMAN stands by the ambulance doors.
REVISIONS: Pete takes Truman's hand, partially lifts off his mask.
REVISIONS: Catherine?
REVISIONS: Not yet, Pete.
REVISIONS: 8. CONTINUED:
REVISIONS: They look at each other. Pete coughs, they readjust his mask, slide the gurney in, close the
REVISIONS: doors. The siren starts up, the ambulance drives off.
REVISIONS: Truman moves away and is joined by DEPUTY HAWK
REVISIONS: Josie's not at Blue Pine, she's not at the office -
REVISIONS: Keep looking.
REVISIONS: Harry, we've looked everywhere -
REVISIONS: Keep looking.
REVISIONS: DEPUTY ANDY lopes up to them.
REVISIONS: Andy, where the hell is Cooper?
REVISIONS: It's the strangest thing, I was talking to him and he put
REVISIONS: the phone down and walked away and it sounded like
REVISIONS: somebody was banging real loud on the door -
REVISIONS: And?
REVISIONS: And then I heard a sound like somebody falling down
REVISIONS: and then about a minute went by and somebody hung up the
REVISIONS: phone.
REVISIONS: Hawk and Truman look at each other.
REVISIONS: 9. INT. COOPER'S ROOM - DAWN
REVISIONS: Cooper's hand reaches out for his tape recorder on the floor not far from where he's lying.
REVISIONS: His fingertips reach it, gain purchase and drag it back to him. In pain and slightly fumble-
REVISIONS: fingered he's able to activate the record button, lie back and bring the recorder to his mouth.
REVISIONS: Diane, it's - I don't know what time it is, Diane, I've
REVISIONS: been shot. I was out for a while and I can't reach my
REVISIONS: 9. CONTINUED:
REVISIONS: watch. The sky's getting light, I can hear birdsong. I'm
REVISIONS: lying on the floor of my room. There is a great deal of
REVISIONS: pain and a fair amount of blood. I seem to remember
REVISIONS: three shots, all to the midsection. I was wearing my vest
REVISIONS: last night, per Bureau regulations when undercover, but
REVISIONS: even so, if you can imagine someone dropping three
REVISIONS: bowling balls on your chest from a height of about nine
REVISIONS: feet you might begin to approximate the sensation.
REVISIONS: On balance, though, being shot is not as bad as I had
REVISIONS: always imagined it might be. If you can manage to
REVISIONS: keep the fear from your mind. Then again, I suppose
REVISIONS: you could say that about almost anything in life: it's not
REVISIONS: so bad if you can keep the fear from your mind.
REVISIONS: At a time like this, curiously, you immediately think of
REVISIONS: the things you regret, or the things you would miss. I
REVISIONS: would like, in general, to treat people with much more
REVISIONS: care and respect. I would like to climb a tall hill, sit in
REVISIONS: the cool grass and feel the sun on my face. I wish I could
REVISIONS: have cracked the Lindbergh kidnapping. I would very
REVISIONS: much like to make love to a beautiful woman who I had
REVISIONS: genuine affection for. I would like that very much.
REVISIONS: All in all, a very interesting experience.
REVISIONS: SOUND of running footsteps. Truman, Hawk and Andy appear in the doorway.
REVISIONS: Ah. They're here.
FADE OUT: 
FADE OUT: 10. EXT. CALHOUN MEMORIAL HOSPITAL - DAY
FADE OUT: 11. INT. CALHOUN HOSPITAL INTENSIVE CARE - DAY
FADE OUT: CAMERA MOVES slowly past a row of charts hanging on hooks at a nurse's station: we read
FADE OUT: the names on the charts:
FADE OUT: ... Pulaski, Ronnette; Jacoby, Lawrence; Hurley, Nadine; Johnson, Shelly; Martell, Pete;
FADE OUT: Johnson, Leo ...
FADE OUT: A NURSE takes a seventh unmarked chart; off the last hook and CAMERA MOVES with her
FADE OUT: picking up staying with an extremely tired DOC HAYWARD sitting in a chair. She hands
FADE OUT: the chart to Hayward. He rises and together they move into an adjoining room ...
FADE OUT: 12. INT. INTENSIVE CARE DAY
FADE OUT: Hayward and the Nurse enter. Cooper is seated on an examining table. Another NURSE is
FADE OUT: cutting away his shirt; revealing his bulletproof vest. Truman stands nearby.
FADE OUT: Morning, Doc.
FADE OUT: My God, what happened to you?
FADE OUT: Three slugs, point blank range.
FADE OUT: You can't remember anything about the shooter.
FADE OUT: All I saw was that muzzle flash and the next thing I knew
FADE OUT: I was drifting on Cloud Nine - busy night, Doc?
FADE OUT: Haven't seen this much action since the Elks Club fire in
FADE OUT: '59 - here we go ...
FADE OUT: Doc and the Nurse ease the bloodstained vest off Cooper. He groans. Large ugly bruises are
FADE OUT: 12. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: revealed. LUCY enters with a clipboard, thermos of coffee and some mugs, just in time to see
FADE OUT: the bruises.
FADE OUT: Oh boy ...
FADE OUT: A little woozy, Truman helps her to a chair.
FADE OUT: Easy there, Luce.
FADE OUT: Oh boy ...
FADE OUT: One of the Nurses partially closes the curtain between the bed and where Lucy is sitting. Lucy
FADE OUT: pours herself a cup of coffee.
FADE OUT: Looks worse than it feels Lucy.
FADE OUT: Let's have you lie back.
FADE OUT: Hayward and a Nurse help Cooper lie back. We see there's a bullet partially embedded in his
FADE OUT: midsection near a rib.
FADE OUT: Doc, I think I picked up a wood tick last night. While
FADE OUT: trying to scratch it off I adjusted my vest upwards and I
FADE OUT: think one shot glanced off the edge of my vest.
FADE OUT: Agent Cooper, I'd have to say you're lucky to be alive.
FADE OUT: I try to tell myself that at least once a day.
FADE OUT: Coffee?
FADE OUT: You bet.
FADE OUT: Lucy, Agent Cooper needs to be brought up to date.
FADE OUT: 12. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: Okay.
FADE OUT: Cooper, I'm working on a warrant for Leo. Arrest and search
FADE OUT: Truman exits. Hayward is prepping to remove the bullet from Cooper's side.
FADE OUT: Go ahead, Lucy.
FADE OUT: Okay.
FADE OUT: I ought to administer an anesthetic.
FADE OUT: No, just hand me my wallet and say when.
FADE OUT: Puzzled, Doc nods to a Nurse, who hands Cooper his wallet.
FADE OUT: This morning, at around 5:45 a.m. Jacques Renault was
FADE OUT: found dead in his bed. It appears to be cardiac arrest,
FADE OUT: which is what happened to my Uncle Walter after he had
FADE OUT: the accident with the lawnmower, but the cause of death
FADE OUT: is not yet officially known.
FADE OUT: Autopsy?
FADE OUT: Soon as we get a minute.
FADE OUT: Please continue, Lucy.
FADE OUT: Cooper watches as Hayward lays out a row of severe looking surgical instruments,
FADE OUT: including a wicked pliar-like utensil.
FADE OUT: Doctor Jacoby is resting comfortably after his heart
FADE OUT: attack, and Ronnette Pulaski is still on life support,
FADE OUT: which the Sheriff told me you already knew about but
FADE OUT: that I should remind you.
FADE OUT: 12. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: Thank you.
FADE OUT: You might be able to question Jacoby later today.
FADE OUT: Shelly Johnson and Pete Martell are in stable condition
FADE OUT: after they were found inside the mill, which caught fire
FADE OUT: and burned down, at least a part of it did not the whole
FADE OUT: mill which is lucky because they had all that lumber
FADE OUT: inside -
FADE OUT: A few second-degree burns, smoke inhalation -
FADE OUT: Smoke inhalation, in addition to which I think Shelly is
FADE OUT: a smoker anyway.
FADE OUT: Doc and Cooper look at each other.
FADE OUT: Nadine Hurley is still unconscious and in serious
FADE OUT: condition because of an overdose of sleeping pills.
FADE OUT: Accidental?
FADE OUT: Ed says she left a note.
FADE OUT: Damn.
FADE OUT: Ready, Cooper?
FADE OUT: Keep talking, Lucy.
FADE OUT: Cooper puts the wallet in his mouth and bites down hard. Hayward picks up the pliars and
FADE OUT: goes to work.
FADE OUT: Leo Johnson was found in his house by Deputy Brennan
FADE OUT: 12. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: with a single gunshot wound to his upper chest. There
FADE OUT: appears to be a spinal injury associated with this wound,
FADE OUT: he's just out of surgery an at this time is still
FADE OUT: unconscious and in critical condition -
FADE OUT: Hayward, who's been working vigorously, pulls hard, the bullet comes out and Cooper lets
FADE OUT: out a yell. Hayward examines the bullet. We see the leg's of a dead tick attached to the end.
FADE OUT: Hell of a way to kill a tick.
FADE OUT: 13. INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
FADE OUT: Truman looks in on ED HURLEY, sitting by the bedside of the unconscious NADINE,
FADE OUT: holding her hand, watching her with fear and devotion, trying to will her back. Truman
FADE OUT: respectfully withdraws before Ed realizes he's there.
FADE OUT: 14. INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
FADE OUT: Truman enters another room, where a NURSE is tending to Shelly, lying quietly in bed, pale,
FADE OUT: exhausted, coughing gently every now and then. Truman nods to the Nurse, who exits.
FADE OUT: Truman sits by the edge of the bed. Shelly manages a weak smile.
FADE OUT: Hi Shelly.
FADE OUT: Hi. Hope you don't mind if I don't get you coffee.
FADE OUT: Leo know I'm here?
FADE OUT: Shelly ...
FADE OUT: What? What?
FADE OUT: Leo was shot last night. He's here in the hospital.
FADE OUT: Oh my God ...
FADE OUT: It's bad. You should know there's a chance he may not
FADE OUT: make it.
FADE OUT: 14. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: Oh my God, what happened?
FADE OUT: We don't know. We found him at your house about an
FADE OUT: hour ago.
FADE OUT: At our house?
FADE OUT: Truman nods. Shelly's thinking, eyes darting around, exploring the possibilities.
FADE OUT: Shelly ... we're gonna need to ask you some questions.
FADE OUT: Can you tell me what you were doing at the mill?
FADE OUT: Tears come to Shelly's eyes.
FADE OUT: Would it be okay if maybe ... we could talk a little
FADE OUT: later? It's just ... you know, with Leo ...
FADE OUT: She starts to cry. Truman pats her on the shoulder.
FADE OUT: I understand. You rest up for a while. I'll be back to see
FADE OUT: you.
FADE OUT: Thanks, Sheriff.
FADE OUT: Truman rises, exits. Shelly tries to put the pieces together.
FADE OUT: Bobby ... Bobby, help me ...
FADE OUT: 15. INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY
FADE OUT: Truman exits Shelly's room, sees Ed coming out of Nadine's room. They approach. Ed
FADE OUT: shrugs, a heartbreaking look of helplessness. Truman gives him a hug.
FADE OUT: I'm sorry.
FADE OUT: 15. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: She's always been a fighter. I'm betting on her.
FADE OUT: I'd lay money on that myself.
FADE OUT: I should have been with her. This wouldn't've happened.
FADE OUT: You can't blame yourself.
FADE OUT: But I do, you see. That's the whole problem.
FADE OUT: Have you seen James? He ought'a know, I've been trying
FADE OUT: to get hold of him.
FADE OUT: Truman decides not to complicate Ed's emotional state.
FADE OUT: Let me take care of that for you.
FADE OUT: Thanks, Harry.
FADE OUT: She knows I'm there. She squeezes my hand when I talk
FADE OUT: to her. She can hear me.
FADE OUT: 'Course she can, Ed. You stay with her. You'll bring her
FADE OUT: back.
FADE OUT: Ed pats him on the back, nods, goes back in, as Truman moves off.
FADE OUT: Cooper, walking stiffly, putting on his shirt, is exiting his room further down the corridor,
FADE OUT: pursued by a distraught Hayward and a confused Lucy.
FADE OUT: - I want to be very clear this is completely against my
FADE OUT: recommendation -
FADE OUT: Thanks, Doc, duly noted -
FADE OUT: You've lost some blood, you've got two cracked ribs,
FADE OUT: some torn cartiledge and possibly a bruised lung -
FADE OUT: 5. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: Lucy, maybe you could run down to the pharmacy and
FADE OUT: pick me up a large bottle of aspirin - Doc, when the
FADE OUT: will is firmly invoked the recuperative powers of the
FADE OUT: physical body are simply extraordinary -
FADE OUT: Harry, I want to go on record, this man should be in a
FADE OUT: hospital.
FADE OUT: I hear you, Doc -
FADE OUT: We're ready to give Leo's house a top to bottom.
FADE OUT: Good, let's get to work.
FADE OUT: I guess we can't formally arrest him until he's conscious.
FADE OUT: Correct. Put a guard on his door, zip up the exits,
FADE OUT: nothing leaks to the press until we've finished the search.
FADE OUT: Cooper stops. Ahead of them, being wheeled out of a room and down the hall by two
FADE OUT: is a gurney holding a huge figure in a large rubber body bag.
FADE OUT: What's that?
FADE OUT: That's Jacques.
FADE OUT: "Shock in a big rubber bag."
FADE OUT: Excuse me?
FADE OUT: Tell you later. Come on, Harry, we've got work to do:
FADE OUT: the attempted murder of a federal agent is an extremely
FADE OUT: serious crime and it barely cracks our top five.
FADE OUT: Cooper moves off, a pained, awakward gait. Hayward and Truman look at each other.
FADE OUT: 15. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: Truman shrugs and starts after Cooper.
FADE OUT: Harry, if you don't mind, you're going to have to do
FADE OUT: most of the driving.
FADE OUT: As they round the corner, we move to look down a long, empty corridor. We move down it
FADE OUT: slowly.
FADE OUT: 15A. INT. HOSPITAL ROOM
FADE OUT: We move in on RONETTE PULASKI, lying in bed, hooked up to life support. As we get
FADE OUT: closer, she moves in a way that indicates she's coming out of the coma.
FADE OUT: 16. EXT. PALMER HOUSE - DAY
FADE OUT: 17. INT. PALMER LIVING ROOM - DAY
FADE OUT: SARAH PALMER and MADDY FERGUSON are having coffee both lost in private
FADE OUT: thought. Pause.
FADE OUT: I had the strangest dream last night.
FADE OUT: About Laura?
FADE OUT: I'm not sure. Maybe. I was in a desert. It was hot and
FADE OUT: dry. There was some kind of animal with me, I
FADE OUT: couldn't see it but I could feel it breathing on me.
FADE OUT: What kind of animal?
FADE OUT: A big cat. I think it was gray. I could see its eyes,
FADE OUT: yellow and red. Then we were in the woods. It was very
FADE OUT: dark. I woke up and the window was open. There was a
FADE OUT: cold wind blowing through the room.
FADE OUT: From the other room, loud robust singing approaches.
FADE OUT: 17. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: LELAND'S VOICE
FADE OUT: "Oh, marsey-doats and dosesy-doats and little lambs
FADE OUT: eat ivy/A kiddlede ivy too, wouldn't you? ... marsey-
FADE OUT: doats and dosesy-doats and little lambs eat ivy/A
FADE OUT: kiddledeet ivy too, wouldn't you? ... "
FADE OUT: LELAND PALMER enters the room, well dressed in a three-piece buisness suit, carrying his
FADE OUT: briefcase. He continues to sing, happy and good-natured, genuinely trying to entertain the
FADE OUT: two women. His hair has turned completely white.
FADE OUT: "Now if the words sound queer and funny to your ear/
FADE OUT: A little bit jumpled and jivey ...
FADE OUT: Say 'Mares eat oats and does eat oats, and little lambs
FADE OUT: eat ivy' ...
FADE OUT: He kisses them both, grabs his hat, kind of flips it onto his head, picks up an umbrella and
FADE OUT: exits, still singing ...
FADE OUT: "Oh, marsey-doats; and dosesy-doats; and little lambs
FADE OUT: eat ivy/A kiddledeet ivy too, wouldn't you? ... marsey-
FADE OUT: doats and dosesy-doats and little lambs eat ivy/A

FADE TO BLACK: 19. INT. BEN HORNE'S OFFICE - DAY
FADE TO BLACK: On a television set in the corner, featuring a news story about the burning mill. SOUND of
FADE TO BLACK: half-spirited Icelander singing from the hall outside. Ben and Jerry appear in the hallway, turn
FADE TO BLACK: and speak back to the Icelanders in the hall.
FADE TO BLACK: Travel safely, Einer; : next year in
FADE TO BLACK: Rekyavik!
FADE TO BLACK: Ben pulls Jerry into the office, closes the door and barks instructions.
FADE TO BLACK: On the bus, on the runway, right up to the plane; no
FADE TO BLACK: television, no newspapers and make sure the pilot
FADE TO BLACK: doesn't fly over the mill, until their check clears as far as
FADE TO BLACK: they're concerned that fire never happened.
FADE TO BLACK: What fire?
FADE TO BLACK: Ben gives him a friendly slap on the cheek.
FADE TO BLACK: Agenda: let's get a location on Catherine, keep our
FADE TO BLACK: distance, We just want to be sure she's ready to take the
FADE TO BLACK: fall, I want a complete medical on Leo Johnson's
FADE TO BLACK: prospects for recovery and a satisfying explanation from
FADE TO BLACK: Hank Jennings why that punk  isn't being measured for a
FADE TO BLACK: plot at Ghostwood Memorial Park.
FADE TO BLACK: Well begun is half done.
FADE TO BLACK: The SOUND of the Icelanders is interrupted by the approaching sound of Leland singing
FADE TO BLACK: "Mare-se-doats." The doors open as he finishes the chorus. Leland spreads his
FADE TO BLACK: arms, a happy smile on his face, his white hair standing up like a field of albino wheat.
FADE TO BLACK: I'm back!
FADE TO BLACK: 19. CONTINUED:
FADE TO BLACK: Ben and Jerry stare at him for a long time.
FADE TO BLACK: 20. EXT. LEO JOHNSON'S HOUSE - DAY
FADE TO BLACK: A lot of police vehicles parked outside.
FADE TO BLACK: 21. INT. LEO JOHNSON'S HOUSE - DAY
FADE TO BLACK: Full-scale forensics going on in the living room; technicians measuring the trajectory the
FADE TO BLACK: bullet took through the broken window. Truman examines the bite Leo's axe took out of the
FADE TO BLACK: wall. Hawk comes out of the bedroom with a small box containing some skin mags,
FADE TO BLACK: including a few back issues of Flesh World, takes them to Cooper, seated stiffly on a chair in
FADE TO BLACK: the middle of the room. We see two PLAINCLOTHES COPS are carefully dismantling the
FADE TO BLACK: kitchen in a thorough search.
FADE TO BLACK: Surprise; Flesh World.
FADE TO BLACK: Good customers must get complimentary subscriptions.
FADE TO BLACK: Still no cocaine, here or in the truck.
FADE TO BLACK: We may have to bring in the dogs. Let's get those down
FADE TO BLACK: to the station.
FADE TO BLACK: I can't figure it; some kind of fight was going on in here.
FADE TO BLACK: Well they weren't doing the Tennessee waltz.
FADE TO BLACK: But the shot came from outside.
FADE TO BLACK: He wasn't shot by the person he was fighting with.
FADE TO BLACK: Two people.
FADE TO BLACK: 21. CONTINUED:
FADE TO BLACK: Leo was trying to turn somebody to kindling. The
FADE TO BLACK: person went down and hit that television; the legs were
FADE TO BLACK: moved off the depressions in the carpet. Leo advanced,
FADE TO BLACK: axe raised, the shot knocked him back onto the couch.
FADE TO BLACK: Shelly?
FADE TO BLACK: Shelly's about ninety-nine pounds soaking wet; that's a
FADE TO BLACK: big old television.
FADE TO BLACK: Was she the shooter?
FADE TO BLACK: That depends on when she got to the mill.
FADE TO BLACK: Truman nods.
FADE TO BLACK: 22. EXT. LEO JOHNSON'S - DAY
FADE TO BLACK: Deputy Andy is working the perimeter outside. He looks up to see a government issue car
FADE TO BLACK: roar up nearby and stop in a cloud of dust. AGENT ALBERT ROSENFIELD and his two
FADE TO BLACK: ASISSTANTS climb out of the car. Andy immediately turns and runs to the house.
FADE TO BLACK: 23. INT. LEO JOHNSON'S PORCH - DAY
FADE TO BLACK: Andy enters and starts for the door.
FADE TO BLACK: Harry! Harry! It's Agent Rosenflower!
FADE TO BLACK: Andy steps on a loose plank levers up like a shot and WHACKS him in the face. He goes
FADE TO BLACK: down. Truman comes out onto the porch from the kitchen, just as Albert enters through the
FADE TO BLACK: outside door. They stare at each other. Andy moans quietly. Albert looks at him.
FADE TO BLACK: Another great moment in law enforcement history.
FADE TO BLACK: The plank Andy dislodged reveals a cavity under the porch, which Truman is the first to
FADE TO BLACK: notice. He kneels down to take a look ...
FADE TO BLACK: 25. INSERT - THE PORCH CAVITY
FADE TO BLACK: Secreted inside is Leo's stash, prominently featuring a couple of kilo bricks of cocaine.
FADE TO BLACK: As he looks back up at Albert.
FADE TO BLACK: Albert, I guess you were more right than you know.
FADE TO BLACK: Good work, Andy.
FADE TO BLACK: His nose bleeding, Andy manages a cockeyed grin.
FADE TO BLACK: 26. EXT. DINER - DAY
FADE TO BLACK: 27. INT. DINER KITCHEN - DAY
FADE TO BLACK: A small bottle of ammonia or some like chemical is opened. HANK JENNINGS lets the
FADE TO BLACK: fumes from the bottle drift up into his face. He inhales, his eyes redden and start to rear. He
FADE TO BLACK: replaces the bottle top and hides the bottle as NORMA JENNINGS enters the kitchen.
FADE TO BLACK: She's not in uniform this morning.
FADE TO BLACK: Hank lets her catch a glimpse of him before turning away.
FADE TO BLACK: Hank?
FADE TO BLACK: Hank grabs a broom and starts to sweep up, trying to hide his "tears."
FADE TO BLACK: Yeah. Hi.
FADE TO BLACK: What is it?
FADE TO BLACK: Nuthin'. Fine.
FADE TO BLACK: She regards him, trust still an issue but today perhaps slightly more on the fence.
FADE TO BLACK: 27. CONTINUED:
FADE TO BLACK: Uh-huh.
FADE TO BLACK: I can't stop thinking of little Shelly in that burning mill
FADE TO BLACK: ... and then as if that's not bad enough, she comes out of
FADE TO BLACK: it to find Leo's been shot? I don't know. I mean I've
FADE TO BLACK: done some rotten things in my life, I don't pretend to be
FADE TO BLACK: any saint, I've paid for it, but why do bad things happen
FADE TO BLACK: to good people? It just ... doesn't seem fair.
FADE TO BLACK: Anyway ...
FADE TO BLACK: I'm just on my way over to see her.
FADE TO BLACK: Yeah, listen, I was gonna send her some flowers
FADE TO BLACK: Maybe you could ...
FADE TO BLACK: She takes the money.
FADE TO BLACK: That's a nice thought.
FADE TO BLACK: Sometimes I guess it is the thought that counts.
FADE TO BLACK: She'll get through this. She's tougher than she looks.
FADE TO BLACK: Yeah. Kind'a reminds me of somebody.
FADE TO BLACK: A wistful grin for her benefit. She half-smiles, pockets the money, starts out.
FADE TO BLACK: She likes snapdragons.
FADE TO BLACK: 28. INT. DINER - DAY
FADE TO BLACK: Norma busies herself behind the counter for a moment. Behind her DONNA HAYWARD
FADE TO BLACK: 28. CONTINUED:
FADE TO BLACK: enters the diner, wearing sunglasses, spots Maddy Ferguson sitting at the counter, moves to
FADE TO BLACK: her and together they move to a booth, maintaining a conspiritorial tone.
FADE TO BLACK: Is it true about James?
FADE TO BLACK: He spent the night in jail.
FADE TO BLACK: Do you think it's because of what we did?
FADE TO BLACK: Look, we don't know if we "did" anything. My dad
FADE TO BLACK: says Dr. Jacoby got sick because he was attacked; all we
FADE TO BLACK: did was send him a tape.
FADE TO BLACK: Maybe he wouldn't have been attacked if we hadn't.
FADE TO BLACK: Maybe. Maybe the sun won't come up tomorrow if we
FADE TO BLACK: wash our hair. Think like that you could go crazy.
FADE TO BLACK: What's done is done. The only way this won't came
FADE TO BLACK: back to haunt us is if we keep quiet about what happened
FADE TO BLACK: last night, because I can promise you that's what James is
FADE TO BLACK: doing. Get the picture?
FADE TO BLACK: Loud and clear.
FADE TO BLACK: I don't know why they're holding James, I'll try to find
FADE TO BLACK: out. In the meantime, mum is the word.
FADE TO BLACK: I heard they caught Laura's killer.
FADE TO BLACK: If that's true why haven't they made an announcement?
FADE TO BLACK: That's what Uncle Leland said this morning -
FADE TO BLACK: Did they come to your house? Did you see it on the
FADE TO BLACK: news?
FADE TO BLACK: 28. CONTINUED:
FADE TO BLACK: No -
FADE TO BLACK: Then until that happens we still have work to do.
FADE TO BLACK: Uncle Leland's hair turned white.
FADE TO BLACK: Really?
FADE TO BLACK: White as a sheet.
FADE TO BLACK: That's weird.
FADE TO BLACK: Norma sees them.
FADE TO BLACK: Oh, Donna,. I've got something for you here.
FADE TO BLACK: She takes an envelope out from under the counter and moves to the booth.
FADE TO BLACK: This came in the mail for you yesterday.
FADE TO BLACK: Thanks, Norma.
FADE TO BLACK: She looks at it.
INTERCUT: 
INTERCUT: 29. THE ENVELOPE
INTERCUT: Adddressed to "Donna Hayward, c/o Norma Jennings, Double R Diner"
INTERCUT: That's odd.
INTERCUT: As Donna examines it, Norma nods, moves off, exits the diner.
INTERCUT: What is it?
INTERCUT: 29. CONTINUED:
INTERCUT: Donna shrugs, opens the envelope, finds a note inside, printed in block letters.
INTERCUT: 
INTERCUT: 30. THE NOTE
INTERCUT: It reads: LOOK INTO THE MEALS ON WHEELS.
INTERCUT: 31. INT. ONE-EYED JACK'S BEDROOM - DAY
INTERCUT: Audrey, alone in her room, sprawled on the bed playing solitaire. She hums. She cheats.
INTERCUT: A knock at the door. A FIFTY-TWO PICK-UP GIRL enters.
INTERCUT: Say, when do they put on the feedbag around here? I
INTERCUT: could eat a bear.
INTERCUT: PICK-UP
INTERCUT: Kitchen's open twenty-four hours a day.
INTERCUT: Yeah? My door isn't. There's no doorknob on my side.
INTERCUT: PICK-UP
INTERCUT: That's for security.
INTERCUT: Whose security?
INTERCUT: PICK-UP
INTERCUT: All the new girls get this room at first.
INTERCUT: All of them?
INTERCUT: PICK-UP
INTERCUT: Until they trust you.
INTERCUT: Then what happens?
INTERCUT: The Girl likes her and is friendly, but is also clearly operating under some other instructions.
INTERCUT: 31. CONTINUED:
INTERCUT: PICK-UP
INTERCUT: Keep asking so many questions and you'll never find out.
INTERCUT: They don't like you asking questions?
INTERCUT: The Girl gestures to be quiet, nods, points to a small screen in the wall; a speaker. Audrey
INTERCUT: nods, understanding.
INTERCUT: I wouldn't normally be so curious, but Jack's is such a
INTERCUT: first-rate joint I'd like to know more about how it's run.
INTERCUT: PICK-UP
INTERCUT: This may be your chance to find out; Blackie would like
INTERCUT: to see you in her office.
INTERCUT: Hey, great.
INTERCUT: They move towards the door.
INTERCUT: What's your name?
INTERCUT: PICK-UP
INTERCUT: Nancy.
INTERCUT: Nancy, one more question ...
INTERCUT: ... don't your boobs start to hurt in this thing?
INTERCUT: Nancy covers her mouth to hide her laugh and nods.
INTERCUT: 32. INT. BLACKIE'S OFFICE, - DAY
INTERCUT: Audrey enters. Blackie, fixed up, looking cool and steely, is getting a shoulder rub from one
INTERCUT: of the PICK-UPs. Another PICK-UP is kneeling in front of her, rubbing her feet.
INTERCUT: 32. CONTINUED:
INTERCUT: Hey, boss, what's up?
INTERCUT: The owner was a little disappointed in your performance
INTERCUT: last night.
INTERCUT: Oh? That's not what he told me.
INTERCUT: He said you were witholding.
INTERCUT: Okay, right away, here's my analysis of the guy, he's a
INTERCUT: big cheese, girls are falling like ripe tomatoes every
INTERCUT: time he walks into a room. Hey, a steady diet of caviar
INTERCUT: would eventually kill you, right? I ask myself, what's
INTERCUT: this guy missing? Conquest, the thrill of victory.
INTERCUT: So you turned tail and made him chase you.
INTERCUT: So to speak. You know the guy, am I right?
INTERCUT: Did you find him attractive?
INTERCUT: Attractive? Yes. I wouldn't say he was my type exactly.
INTERCUT: Blackie rises and insinuates her way right up to Audrey. She touches Audrey's check.
INTERCUT: And who would you say is your type, exactly?
INTERCUT: Not you. No offense.
INTERCUT: Blackie slaps her hard. Audrey raises her hand to slap back. Blackie catches her wrist.
INTERCUT: Let's get one thing straight between us, princess ...
INTERCUT: 32. CONTINUED:
INTERCUT: Okay.
INTERCUT: Audrey hears the snick of a lock engaging.  Blackie's put a handcuff on her
INTERCUT: wrist.
INTERCUT: When you work for me, everybody's your type. Whether
INTERCUT: you like it or not.
INTERCUT: They look at each other.
FADE OUT: 
FADE OUT: 33. EXT. SHERIFF'S STATION - DAY
FADE OUT: 34. INT. SHERIFF'S STATION - DAY
FADE OUT: Cooper, shirt off, ribs heavily taped, sits on the conference table, as Albert Rosenfield
FADE OUT: examines him, using a stethescope. Albert's briefcase is open on the table.
FADE OUT: How simple can I make it, Cooper? FBI Agent gets
FADE OUT: shot; FBI Agent investigates. I'm in proximity,
FADE OUT: working in the Seattle lab, I'm familiar with the
FADE OUT: underlying case -
FADE OUT: We don't know that they're related.
FADE OUT: Right. You didn't pick up your towels so the chamber
FADE OUT: maid plugged you.
FADE OUT: Albert, the point is you're not going to win any local
FADE OUT: popularity contests -
FADE OUT: No, the point is Gordon Cole ordered me back here.
FADE OUT: We follow orders. Breathe.
FADE OUT: You were shot by a right-handed person, five foot six to
FADE OUT: ten inches tall, at a distance of less than three feet. I'll
FADE OUT: have ballistics this afternoon. You're blank on other
FADE OUT: details?
FADE OUT: Yes.
FADE OUT: I'll take it from here. Meanwhile one of your principal
FADE OUT: suspects was murdered in his hospital bed, the other was
FADE OUT: shot in his living room. You tell me: vigilante justice or
FADE OUT: just clean country living?
FADE OUT: 34. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: Albert, let me ask you something; where does this
FADE OUT: attitude of generalized unpleasantness come from?
FADE OUT: I'll get back to you.
FADE OUT: If you don't want both eyes blackened on a regular basis,
FADE OUT: while you're here I suggest you make some kind of peace
FADE OUT: with rural life.
FADE OUT: Great. After the square dance maybe we can go for a
FADE OUT: hayride. I'll be at the hospital.
FADE OUT: A knock. Andy Brennan enters.
FADE OUT: Agent Cooper? You wanted to see me?
FADE OUT: Have a seat, Andy.
FADE OUT: Andy sits. Albert packs up his briefcase.
FADE OUT: Andy, I wanted to have a brief chat about the events of
FADE OUT: yesterday.
FADE OUT: Okay.
FADE OUT: When an officer's involved in something like this, it can
FADE OUT: result in a great number of distractions in the workplace.
FADE OUT: Uh-huh.
FADE OUT: The thing to focus on is your daily routine; cling to it.
FADE OUT: Let it become the tent pole around which you organize
FADE OUT: your waking life.
FADE OUT: 34. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: Okay.
FADE OUT: The job can provide the structure you need to survive,
FADE OUT: while body and mind are left free to heal the wounds our
FADE OUT: work occasionally, inevitably inflicts.
FADE OUT: All right.
FADE OUT: Even if committed in the line of duty and in a timely
FADE OUT: and heroic fashion, the firing of our weapon, the shooting
FADE OUT: of another human being, no matter how villainous the
FADE OUT: individual may be, exacts a spiritual and emotional toll
FADE OUT: on the officer.
FADE OUT: Oh.
FADE OUT: I thought you were talking about me and Lucy.
FADE OUT: Cooper looks at him. At the door, Albert looks at Andy, back at Cooper.
FADE OUT: Where do they keep his water dish?
FADE OUT: Albert exits.
FADE OUT: 35. INT. SHERIFF'S STATION RECEPTION - DAY
FADE OUT: Albert exits past Lucy, at the coffee station.
FADE OUT: Welcome back.
FADE OUT: For me? You shouldn't have.
FADE OUT: Albert exits the station, passing PHILLIP MICHAEL GIRARD, the one-armed man, just
FADE OUT: entering, muscling in his hefty sample case. He approaches Lucy, back at her desk.
FADE OUT: -
FADE OUT: 35. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: Excuse me, is Sheriff Truman here?
FADE OUT: He is but he's busy at the moment, may I help you?
FADE OUT: I'm afraid I don't have an appointment.
FADE OUT: The Sheriff asked me to stop by at my convenience, this
FADE OUT: was the first convenient moment.
FADE OUT: 35. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: Will the Sheriff know what this is regarding?
FADE OUT: I'm here to sell him some shoes.
FADE OUT: 36. INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY
FADE OUT: JAMES HURLEY sits across from Sheriff Truman. A small tape recorder sits on the table
FADE OUT: between them. We hear ...
FADE OUT: LAURA'S VOICE
FADE OUT: ... uh-oh, here comes Mom with milk and cookies ... see
FADE OUT: you later, Lawrence, bye-bye.
FADE OUT: Tape hiss, then silence. Truman turns off the tape.
FADE OUT: You got this tape from Dr. Jacoby's office.
FADE OUT: Yes sir.
FADE OUT: That's breaking and entering, James.
FADE OUT: The door was open.
FADE OUT: How did you know Jacoby wouldn't be there?
FADE OUT: I knocked, nobody answered.
FADE OUT: You were alone?
FADE OUT: 36. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: Yes.
FADE OUT: Pause.
FADE OUT: James, maybe you had your reasons. You realize we may
FADE OUT: not see it that way. Especially with three ounces of
FADE OUT: cocaine in your gas tank.
FADE OUT: You know I didn't put that there.
FADE OUT: I know what I'd like to believe. I also know you were
FADE OUT: seeing Laura the last few weeks, which means you could
FADE OUT: have been mixed up in anything.
FADE OUT: Uncle Ed know I'm in here?
FADE OUT: I haven't told him yet.
FADE OUT: Nadine took an overdose of pills last night. She's in the
FADE OUT: hospital. Ed's with her. I didn't want to tell him about
FADE OUT: this.
FADE OUT: She gonna be all right?
FADE OUT: They don't know yet.
FADE OUT: Poor Nadine.
FADE OUT: James, if there's anything else you want to tell me, this
FADE OUT: would be a good time.
FADE OUT: Laura talks on her tape about a "mystery man."
FADE OUT: The Red Corvette. Leo Johnson.
FADE OUT: 36. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: I think it's somebody else. Not Jacques Renault either.
FADE OUT: Who?
FADE OUT: I never put it together until I heard the tape, where she
FADE OUT: said "this guy can really light my fire?" She said
FADE OUT: something once about a friend of her father's.
FADE OUT: Somebody she'd known since she was a kid. She said
FADE OUT: this guy was really into fire.
FADE OUT: What did she mean by that?
FADE OUT: I don't know. Laura said a lot of nutty stuff. Most of
FADE OUT: the time it went right by you.
FADE OUT: Cooper enters the room, still walking strangely, followed by Hawk.
FADE OUT: James, let's get right to the point. You found something
FADE OUT: else in Jacoby's office. I want it. Give it to me.
FADE OUT: James looks at Truman, looks back at Cooper. Cooper holds out his hand.
FADE OUT: Come on.
FADE OUT: James takes out the half-a-heart necklace, puts it in Cooper's hand.
FADE OUT: That was with the tape.
FADE OUT: Very good. Hawk, take James back to his cell.
FADE OUT: You gonna book me?
FADE OUT: We're going to talk about it.
FADE OUT: Hawk leads James out. Truman stares at him. Cooper examines the necklace.
FADE OUT: 36. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: How'd you know he had the necklace?
FADE OUT: Harry, do you know what they call it when preparation
FADE OUT: meets opportunity?
FADE OUT: Give me a minute ...
FADE OUT: Luck. The residue of hard work. Come on, I've got
FADE OUT: something to show you.
FADE OUT: "Luck is the residue of hard work."
FADE OUT: That's the ticket.
FADE OUT: 37. INT. SHERIFF'S STATION RECEPTION/CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
FADE OUT: Wearing, dark glasses, Donna is standing near the front desk, Lucy's behind the desk, Andy's
FADE OUT: in the coffee area, as Cooper and Truman come around the corner.
FADE OUT: Lucy, Andy, I need you in the conference room ...
FADE OUT: Agent Cooper, Doc Hayward called from the hospital,
FADE OUT: he said Dr. Jacoby is conscious and that if you wanted to
FADE OUT: question him now you could come over to the hospital -
FADE OUT: They're now in the conference room. The box that came for Cooper in the mail is open on
FADE OUT: the table.
FADE OUT: Thank you, Lucy. Is Donna here to see James?
FADE OUT: Yes.
FADE OUT: Cooper nods to Truman, who gets the message and exits the room. Cooper opens the box
FADE OUT: and empties the contents on the table.
FADE OUT: 37. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: This is every edition of "Flesh World" published in the
FADE OUT: last three years.
FADE OUT: This is a picture of Theresa Banks, the first victim of our
FADE OUT: killer, who you'll recall was found a year ago in the
FADE OUT: southern part of the state. We already know Ronette and
FADE OUT: Laura's picture appeared in ads in the magazine -
FADE OUT: You want us to look for a picture of Theresa Banks.
FADE OUT: Andy, you're way ahead of me.
FADE OUT: Andy smiles pridefully at Lucy, then remembers how upset he is and cancels the look.
FADE OUT: Lucy, we'll be at the hospital.
FADE OUT: Diane, I've just received the back issues issues of "Flesh
FADE OUT: World." Good work. It's nice to see some cooperation
FADE OUT: with the law, especially from a company that preys on
FADE OUT: human weaknesses -
FADE OUT: Andy and Lucy look at each other. Look at the magazines. Any assignment but this.
FADE OUT: 38. INT. SHERIFF'S STATION HOLDING CELL AREA - DAY
FADE OUT: Hawk unlocks the door, lets Donnna into the corridor outside James' cell, then quietly
FADE OUT: retreats.
FADE OUT: How you doing?
FADE OUT: Did you tell them anything?
FADE OUT: They haven't asked me anything.
FADE OUT: She takes out a cigarette. Lights it. James is mildly surprised.
FADE OUT: When did you start smoking?
FADE OUT: 38. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: I smoke every once in a while. Helps relieve the tension.
FADE OUT: Uh-huh.
FADE OUT: So, did you tell them anything?
FADE OUT: I didn't tell them about you or Maddy.
FADE OUT: Do they think Leo killed Laura?
FADE OUT: I don't know what they think. How's Maddy?
FADE OUT: She's all right. She hasn't said anything either. I heard
FADE OUT: them say Jacoby's conscious, they're going to question
FADE OUT: him.
FADE OUT: Great.
FADE OUT: Donna stubs the cigarette out on a bar, peeks at him over the dark glasses.
FADE OUT: So ... don't you want to kiss me?
FADE OUT: They look at each other. James leans forward and kisses her tenderly through the bars; she
FADE OUT: responds agressively, grabs him, hot. He pulls back and looks at her, puzzled.
FADE OUT: What's wrong?
FADE OUT: Nothing's wrong.
FADE OUT: Or is it just not okay for me to want you?
FADE OUT: They look at each other, James a little uncertain. She smiles, pushes her dark glasses back up.
FADE OUT: 38. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: Get out soon, James.
FADE OUT: She bites his finger and leaves the room. James watches her go.
FADE TO BLACK: 
FADE TO BLACK: 39. INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY
FADE TO BLACK: BOBBY BRIGGS sneaks around a corner, avoids a nurse and waits outside the door to Shelly's
FADE TO BLACK: room. A DOCTOR exits the room. Bobby slips inside ...
FADE TO BLACK: 40. INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
FADE TO BLACK: Bobby kicks out the doorstop, closes the door, moves to Shelly's bed. She's lying asleep.
FADE TO BLACK: Bobby takes a small bouquet from under his jacket, holds it under her nose. She stirs.
FADE TO BLACK: Hey, Sleeping Beauty.
FADE TO BLACK: She opens her eyes, sees him.
FADE TO BLACK: Bobby?
FADE TO BLACK: He kisses her. She lets herself be swept up for a moment, then remembers ...
FADE TO BLACK: Bobby, what are you doing here? What if somebody sees
FADE TO BLACK: you?
FADE TO BLACK: I don't care. I don't care anymore.
FADE TO BLACK: Leo's in the hospital. Somebody shot him.
FADE TO BLACK: I know. I mean, I heard. What happened to you?
FADE TO BLACK: Bobby, he tried to kill me. He knew about us, he took
FADE TO BLACK: me to the mill. He tied me up and left me there and
FADE TO BLACK: started the fire - he said he was gonna kill you.
FADE TO BLACK: Far chance. Are you all right?
FADE TO BLACK: Doctors seem to think so.
FADE TO BLACK: 40. CONTINUED:
FADE TO BLACK: Shelly, the only way you're gonna get out of here pronto
FADE TO BLACK: is if you let Bobby be your doctor.
FADE TO BLACK: Now let's just have a look here, miss, shall we?
FADE TO BLACK: He lifts her bedclothes, separates her gown, looks down at her.
FADE TO BLACK: I think you're coming along splendidly.
FADE TO BLACK: He breathes once on the stethescope, erotically places it on her chest.
FADE TO BLACK: Deep breath ... that's a girl, deep breath ... that's fine ...
FADE TO BLACK: He swoops down for a kiss. She responds.
FADE TO BLACK: I'd say you're on your way to a complete recovery.
FADE TO BLACK: They kiss again. She laughs. They hear VOICES in the hallway outside.
FADE TO BLACK: You'd better go.
FADE TO BLACK: You're my girl.
FADE TO BLACK: I love you, Bobby.
FADE TO BLACK: He pauses,
FADE TO BLACK: I guess I love you, too.
FADE TO BLACK: He puts the flowers in a medical jar by her bedside and quickly splits to the hallway.
FADE TO BLACK: 41. INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY
FADE TO BLACK: Bobby slips away as Cooper  and Truman come around the corner. Cooper
FADE TO BLACK: catches a glimpse of Bobby.
FADE TO BLACK: 41. CONTINUED:
FADE TO BLACK: Bobby Briggs.
FADE TO BLACK: What's he doing here?
FADE TO BLACK: He didn't look sick.
FADE TO BLACK: They look at each other. They move on, find Doc Hayward at the coffee bar.
FADE TO BLACK: Doc, who was Bobby Briggs visiting?
FADE TO BLACK: I didn't even know he was here.
FADE TO BLACK: How's it going, Doc?
FADE TO BLACK: Thank god for the coffee bean.
FADE TO BLACK: Doc, you said a mouthful.
FADE TO BLACK: I still think you ought to be resting.
FADE TO BLACK: How does that saying go, is it no rest for the weary?
FADE TO BLACK: I thought it was no rest for the wicked.
FADE TO BLACK: I never could get that straight.
FADE TO BLACK: Cooper looks in the room across the hall at intensive care, at Ed Hurley, sitting by Nadine's
FADE TO BLACK: bedside.
FADE TO BLACK: Excuse me for a moment...
FADE TO BLACK: Cooper moves stiffly into the room across the hall.
FADE TO BLACK: 42. INT. INTENSIVE HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
FADE TO BLACK: Cooper knocks gently on the doorframe. Ed, seated by the bed, holding Nadine's hand. Ed
FADE TO BLACK: glances back at him.
FADE TO BLACK: Agent Cooper ...
FADE TO BLACK: Ed ... how is she ?
FADE TO BLACK: She's in a coma. They say there's nothing else we can
FADE TO BLACK: do. She has to want to come back.
FADE TO BLACK: Cooper puts a hand on Ed's shoulder.
FADE TO BLACK: I don't know why I'm whispering ...
FADE TO BLACK: How are you?
FADE TO BLACK: All I can do is think about the things I should have said
FADE TO BLACK: or done.
FADE TO BLACK: Don't be too hard to yourself
FADE TO BLACK: I never believed in fate. I always thought you make
FADE TO BLACK: your own way, you take care of your own and you clean
FADE TO BLACK: up after yourself.
FADE TO BLACK: Sound advice.
FADE TO BLACK: .
FADE TO BLACK: So you see, for me to say to myself now that Nadine's
FADE TO BLACK: had an appointment with those pills from the get-go ...
FADE TO BLACK: just to make myself feel better ... that's about as low
FADE TO BLACK: as a man can sink. I saw this coming and didn't want to
FADE TO BLACK: believe it. What's worse is, I'm sitting here thinking
FADE TO BLACK: maybe there's some part of me that didn't want to stop
FADE TO BLACK: 42. CONTINUED:
FADE TO BLACK: her. That's a full load.
FADE TO BLACK: When did you get married, Ed?
FADE TO BLACK: Right out of high school. See, Norma and I'd been together
FADE TO BLACK: all through school . Everybody figured we'd get
FADE TO BLACK: hitched, that'd be that, I barely knew Nadine to say hello
FADE TO BLACK: to. That spring, one bad weekend, Norma ran off with Hank.
FADE TO BLACK: I was so twisted up inside I couldn't see straight. When I
FADE TO BLACK: opened my eyes there was Nadine right in front of me.
FADE TO BLACK: There was something so ... sweet and helpless about her.
FADE TO BLACK: We drove all night. Ended up in some little town in
FADE TO BLACK: Montana, out past Great Falls ... I asked her to marry
FADE TO BLACK: me, half-joking, half-drunk, half-crazy. It was getting
FADE TO BLACK: light when we found a Justice of the Peace.
FADE TO BLACK: Norma, she ... she hadn't even slept with Hank. The
FADE TO BLACK: look on her face when she found out ...
FADE TO BLACK: Nadine and I, we went up to my Dad's old cabin, up in
FADE TO BLACK: Eagle Pass. Honeymoon. I was hoping maybe we'd get
FADE TO BLACK: around to talking about an anullment, a divorce,
FADE TO BLACK: anything. But Nadine was so happy.
FADE TO BLACK: The first day we went hunting pheasant. Wanted to bag our
FADE TO BLACK: own dinner. Nadine was a crack shot. We had two birds
FADE TO BLACK: already, but I felt good shooting, liked the way the sound
FADE TO BLACK: echoed and rolled down those hills. I fired. A piece of
FADE TO BLACK: buckshot skipped off a rock and caught her square in the eye.
FADE TO BLACK: She laid across my lap as I drove us back to town. She
FADE TO BLACK: never cried, never blamed me, never hated me for it.
FADE TO BLACK: 'Couple months later, Norma married Hank.
FADE TO BLACK: I don't believe in fate. You make your bed. You sleep in it.
FADE TO BLACK: Cooper's moved. Ed strokes Nadine's cheek, moves a strand of hair. A soft knock on the
FADE TO BLACK: door.
FADE TO BLACK: Ed? Someone here to see you.
FADE TO BLACK: 42. CONTINUED:
FADE TO BLACK: He turns. James steps into the doorway. We see Hawk in background. Ed rises. He and
FADE TO BLACK: James embrace. Cooper withdraws from the room.
FADE TO BLACK: 43. INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY
FADE TO BLACK: Cooper  and Truman walk slowly away. Cooper shakes his head.
FADE TO BLACK: Take James back when they're done.
FADE TO BLACK: Hawk nods. Cooper and Truman continue on.
FADE TO BLACK: Poor Ed. Poor Nadine.
FADE TO BLACK: Yeah.
FADE TO BLACK: They move around the corner.
FADE TO BLACK: 44. INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
FADE TO BLACK: Cooper and Truman enter. DR. JACOBY is lying in bed, hooked up to various monitors, but
FADE TO BLACK: sitting up, rested, alert. Doc Hayward is seated by his bedside. He rises, Cooper takes his
FADE TO BLACK: seat.
FADE TO BLACK: What happened to you?
FADE TO BLACK: I'll see about some coffee.
FADE TO BLACK: Thanks, Doc.
FADE TO BLACK: Cooper and Truman take seats beside Jacboy's bed.
FADE TO BLACK: Dr. Jacoby, I know you've been through quite a bit in the
FADE TO BLACK: last twenty-four hours. So have I. I don't want to
FADE TO BLACK: pussyfoot around with you anymore or see any more
FADE TO BLACK: 44. CONTINUED:
FADE TO BLACK: magic tricks or hear anymore psychological mumbo-
FADE TO BLACK: jumbo. I want you to tell us how you came into
FADE TO BLACK: possession of this
FADE TO BLACK: Cooper reveals the half-a-heart necklace. Jacoby is saddened seeing it, holds it gently in his
FADE TO BLACK: hands.
FADE TO BLACK: Shall I start at the beginning?
FADE TO BLACK: That's as good a place as any.
FADE TO BLACK: Laura started coming to see me nine months ago. On her
FADE TO BLACK: own. Picked my name out of the phone book. I thought,
FADE TO BLACK: what in the world could be troubling such a bright,
FADE TO BLACK: pretty girl?
FADE TO BLACK: And?
FADE TO BLACK: Laura was, in essence, living a double life; two people,
FADE TO BLACK: self-divided, and those two selves were literally at war.
FADE TO BLACK: A war of attrition. And the part of her that was good
FADE TO BLACK: and loving was gradually losing ground.
FADE TO BLACK: Why?
FADE TO BLACK: Because the other self was stronger. The last time I saw
FADE TO BLACK: her, two days before her death, it seemed to me she had
FADE TO BLACK: reached a kind of peace with herself. I now believe that
FADE TO BLACK: what she had in fact arrived at was a decision to end her
FADE TO BLACK: life.
FADE TO BLACK: Suicide?
FADE TO BLACK: She didn't kill herself.
FADE TO BLACK: No. She allowed herself to be killed.
FADE TO BLACK: 44. CONTINUED:
FADE TO BLACK: I don't understand.
FADE TO BLACK: She had reached a point where her good self believed
FADE TO BLACK: that death was the only way to prevent the other side
FADE TO BLACK: from complete domination. Death, in this sense,
FADE TO BLACK: represented a kind of victory.
FADE TO BLACK: Good Lord ...
FADE TO BLACK: The necklace ...
FADE TO BLACK: As I told you,the night after she died, I followed a man
FADE TO BLACK: in a red corvette.
FADE TO BLACK: Leo Johnson.
FADE TO BLACK: Correct. He eluded me near the Old Sawmill Road.
FADE TO BLACK: As I sat there cursing my lack of horsepower, a
FADE TO BLACK: motorcycle drove by -
FADE TO BLACK: James and Donna.
FADE TO BLACK: Which I discovered after following them, on foot, into
FADE TO BLACK: the woods. They spoke intently for a while, I couldn't
FADE TO BLACK: hear them, then they buried something in the ground and
FADE TO BLACK: drove away.
FADE TO BLACK: 45. EXT. WOODS - NIGHT
FADE TO BLACK: MOVING POV, a flashlight beam travels along the ground, finds the white rock. A gloved
FADE TO BLACK: hand reaches down and takes the necklace.
FADE TO BLACK: JACOBY'S VOICE
FADE TO BLACK: Unable to quench my curiosity, I dug down and found
FADE TO BLACK: the necklace. I had seen it around Laura's neck many
FADE TO BLACK: 45. CONTINUED:
FADE TO BLACK: JACOBY'S VOICE
FADE TO BLACK: times. Perhaps ill-advisedly, I took it as a keepsake.
FADE TO BLACK: 46. DR. JACOBY
FADE TO BLACK: Tears in his eyes, looking at the necklace in his hand.
FADE TO BLACK: This was her, you see. The necklace. A divided heart.
FADE TO BLACK: Pause. Cooper gently takes it from him.
FADE TO BLACK: One more thing. You were in this room with Jacques
FADE TO BLACK: when he was killed.
FADE TO BLACK: Yes. Heavily sedated.
FADE TO BLACK: Did you see or hear anything?
FADE TO BLACK: I can remember hearing the fire alarm go off.
FADE TO BLACK: That's all, I ... it's all like a dream, I'm sorry. Wait, I
FADE TO BLACK: ... there was a smell, a peculiar smell.
FADE TO BLACK: When he died, Jacques voided his bowels.
FADE TO BLACK: No. This was like oil. Like scorched engine oil.
FADE TO BLACK: Truman and Cooper look at each other.
FADE TO BLACK: 47. INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY
FADE TO BLACK: Cooper and Truman walk.
FADE TO BLACK: Harry, let's get a hold of Albert. We'll meet back at
FADE TO BLACK: the station. I'm ready to lay the whole thing out.
FADE TO BLACK: 47. CONTINUED:
FADE TO BLACK: Rocks and bottles?
FADE TO BLACK: Chalk and the blackboard will be just fine.
FADE TO BLACK: They move around the corner out of sight.
FADE TO BLACK: TRUMAN'S VOICE
FADE TO BLACK: Maybe some doughnuts.
FADE TO BLACK: COOPER'S VOICE
FADE TO BLACK: That goes without saying.
FADE TO BLACK: We PICK UP and STAY WITH Norma, just leaving Shelly's room, calling back to her.
FADE TO BLACK: I'll come back later and bring you some soup. The food
FADE TO BLACK: in this place'll kill you quicker than most diseases.
FADE TO BLACK: You know, I got a real sweet tooth, too.
FADE TO BLACK: I've got some fresh choclate/peanut butter pie.
FADE TO BLACK: Norma, I'm serious: bring the whole pie.
FADE TO BLACK: Feel better, sweetie.
FADE TO BLACK: I do already.
FADE TO BLACK: Bye-bye.
FADE TO BLACK: Norma moves down the corridor. She stops outside Nadine's room, sees Ed at her bedside,
FADE TO BLACK: holding Nadine's hand. She watches them for a moment, then slowly pulls away from the
FADE TO BLACK: door.
FADE TO BLACK: 
FADE TO BLACK: 48. EXT. DINER - DAY
FADE TO BLACK: Bobby Briggs enters the diner, looks around, moves to the counter and hears ...
FADE TO BLACK: MAJOR BRIGGS' VOICE
FADE TO BLACK: Son?
FADE TO BLACK: Bobby turns. The Major is sitting in a booth, enjoying a cup of coffee and some pie, a napkin
FADE TO BLACK: in his shirt front.
FADE TO BLACK: Dad?
FADE TO BLACK: An awkward moment.
FADE TO BLACK: Would you ... care to join me?
FADE TO BLACK: Bobby looks around. No escape.
FADE TO BLACK: Yeah, okay.
FADE TO BLACK: Bobby slumps into the booth across from his father.
FADE TO BLACK: How was school today?
FADE TO BLACK: School? Oh. Fine.
FADE TO BLACK: That's good.
FADE TO BLACK: The Major takes another bite of pie. A brief lull.
FADE TO BLACK: How was work?
FADE TO BLACK: Work? Work was good.
FADE TO BLACK: Another hiatus. More pie.
FADE TO BLACK: 48. CONTINUED:
FADE TO BLACK: Dad?
FADE TO BLACK: Yes, son.
FADE TO BLACK: What is it that you do, exactly?
FADE TO BLACK: That's classified.
FADE TO BLACK: Oh.
FADE TO BLACK: Bobby, would you care for a piece of pie? The huckleberries are
FADE TO BLACK: particularly delicious today.
FADE TO BLACK: No, thanks.
FADE TO BLACK: Particularly fresh and delicious.
FADE TO BLACK: More pie and a pause.
FADE TO BLACK: This is so weird.
FADE TO BLACK: Oh, I've been coming here for Norma's pie and coffee
FADE TO BLACK: for many years. It's a short drive from the base, roughly
FADE TO BLACK: twelve minutes if the lights are with you. At one time, I
FADE TO BLACK: was nearly what you might call a habitue.
FADE TO BLACK: You don't say.
FADE TO BLACK: Finishing his pie, Major Briggs tidily wipes the corners of his mouth, pushes his plate away
FADE TO BLACK: and folds his napkin.
FADE TO BLACK: The gospel truth. Son, may I share something with you?
FADE TO BLACK: Not the pie.
FADE TO BLACK: 48. CONTINUED:
FADE TO BLACK: A vision I had in my sleep last night. As distinguished
FADE TO BLACK: from a dream, which is a mere sorting and cataloguing
FADE TO BLACK: of the day's events by the subconscious; a vision, fresh
FADE TO BLACK: and clear as a mountain stream, the mind revealing itself
FADE TO BLACK: to itself.
FADE TO BLACK: Uh-huh.
FADE TO BLACK: In my vision I was on the verandah of a vast estate, a
FADE TO BLACK: palazzo of some fantastic proportion. There seemed to
FADE TO BLACK: emanate from it, a light from within this gleaming,
FADE TO BLACK: radiant marble. I ha known this place. I had, in fact,
FADE TO BLACK: been born and raised there and this was my first return, a
FADE TO BLACK: reunion with the deepest wellsprings of my being. As I
FADE TO BLACK: wandered about I noticed happily that the house had
FADE TO BLACK: been immaculately maintained and there had been
FADE TO BLACK: added to it a number of additional rooms but in a way
FADE TO BLACK: that blended in so seamlessly with the original
FADE TO BLACK: construction one would never detect any difference.
FADE TO BLACK: Returning to the house's grand foyer, there came a knock
FADE TO BLACK: at the door. I opened it. My son was standing there. It
FADE TO BLACK: wasn't you, but in a way it was. He was happy and
FADE TO BLACK: carefree, clearly living a life of deep harmony and joy.
FADE TO BLACK: We embraced, a warm and loving embrace, nothing
FADE TO BLACK: witheld. We were, in this moment, one. My vision
FADE TO BLACK: ended and I awoke with an overwhelming feeling of
FADE TO BLACK: optimism and confidence about you and your future.
FADE TO BLACK: That was my vision of you.
FADE TO BLACK: Really.
FADE TO BLACK: I'm so glad I've had this opporunity to share it with
FADE TO BLACK: you.
FADE TO BLACK: Major Briggs rises and extends a hand. He and Bobby shakes hands.
FADE TO BLACK: I wish you nothing but the very best in all things.
FADE TO BLACK: Thank you.
FADE TO BLACK: 48. CONTINUED:
FADE TO BLACK: I'll see you later at home.
FADE TO BLACK: Okay.
FADE TO BLACK: Major Briggs moves off to pay his bill. Hank mans the register.
FADE TO BLACK: How was everything?
FADE TO BLACK: Exceptional, as always.
FADE TO BLACK: Great.
FADE TO BLACK: Major Briggs tips his hat, gives Bobby a happy wave and exits. Bobby waves back, sits in the
FADE TO BLACK: booth, trying to add this up to a round figure.
FADE TO BLACK: Norma enters the diner, clearly upset. She moves behind the counter, starts towards the
FADE TO BLACK: back.
FADE TO BLACK: How was she? ... Norma?
FADE TO BLACK: I can't talk right now.
FADE TO BLACK: She disappears into the kitchen. Hank gives a look to Bobby, a conspiritorial shrug
FADE TO BLACK: before moving off. Bobby returns it, before remembering where he last saw
FADE TO BLACK: Hank.
FADE TO BLACK: 49. BOBBY'S MEMORY - POV
FADE TO BLACK: Looking out the window of Leo Johnson's house at Hank, just after he shot Leo.
FADE TO BLACK: 50. BOBBY
FADE TO BLACK: Adding up another equation.
FADE TO BLACK: 51. EXT. SHERIFF'S STATION - DAY
FADE TO BLACK: 52. INT. SHERIFF'S STATION CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
FADE TO BLACK: The blackboard is set up at one end of the room. Truman,
FADE TO BLACK: Hawk and Andy enter and take seats at the opposite end of the table. A tearful Lucy enters
FADE TO BLACK: with a platter of doughnuts which she sets down on the table. Everyone takes one.
FADE TO BLACK: Cooper looks at his watch. Albert enters the room, sets down his briefcase.
FADE TO BLACK: Oh. Was I late?
FADE TO BLACK: Have a seat, Albert. Albert, Harry, jump in any time;
FADE TO BLACK: we're going to reconstruct the last hours of Laura Palmer.
FADE TO BLACK: Cooper flips over the squeaky blackboard. A map of the town featuring a number of
FADE TO BLACK: symbols, houses, etc. have been drawn on the board.
FADE TO BLACK: Lucy, if you could man the pointer, I need to sit down.
FADE TO BLACK: He takes out his collapsible pointer, telescopes it to full length, hands it to Lucy and sits.
FADE TO BLACK: Lucy stands in front of the board, blows her nose.
FADE TO BLACK: We'll keep this simple, Lucy. When I say something,
FADE TO BLACK: you point to it.
FADE TO BLACK: I'll try my best.
FADE TO BLACK: Andy looks pained.
FADE TO BLACK: On the afternoon of February 23, Laura left school at
FADE TO BLACK: approximately 2:30 in the afternoon ...
FADE TO BLACK: Lucy points to a drawing of a building with "HIGH SCHOOL" printed beneath it.
FADE TO BLACK: She proceeded by family car to the Double R Diner.
FADE TO BLACK: Lucy points, etc.
FADE TO BLACK: 53. INT. DOUBLE R DINER - DAY
FADE TO BLACK: MOS flashback. Laura picks up two large paper bags from Norma at the counter.
FADE TO BLACK: COOPER'S VOICE
FADE TO BLACK: ... where she picked up nine hot meals and distributed
FADE TO BLACK: them to nine shut-ins around town as part of the Meals on
FADE TO BLACK: Wheels program.
FADE TO BLACK: 54. INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
FADE TO BLACK: Lucy points to six small "buildings" scattered around the map.
FADE TO BLACK: At the conclusion of which she drove to the Blue Pine
FADE TO BLACK: Lodge ... where she gave Josie Packard an English lesson.
FADE TO BLACK: You might consider making them manditory for all the
FADE TO BLACK: townsfolk.
FADE TO BLACK: Just a suggestion.
FADE TO BLACK: Laura then returned home ... she dined with her parents.
FADE TO BLACK: At 7:00 that evening she drove to Bobby Briggs' house.
FADE TO BLACK: She and Bobby did homework together until 9:00.
FADE TO BLACK: What do you think, Sheriff: trigonometry?
FADE TO BLACK: Bobby claims it was civics.
FADE TO BLACK: That seems much more likely.
FADE TO BLACK: At which Laura drove home.
FADE TO BLACK: 55. INT. PALMER LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
FADE TO BLACK: MOS flashback. Laura walks through the room, says good night to Sarah, and starts up the
FADE TO BLACK: 55. CONTINUED:
FADE TO BLACK: stairs.
FADE TO BLACK: COOPER'S VOICE
FADE TO BLACK: She said goodnight to her mother and went upstairs. A
FADE TO BLACK: few minutes later she received a phone call.
FADE TO BLACK: Sarah looks at the phone.
FADE TO BLACK: COOPER'S VOICE
FADE TO BLACK: Mrs. Palmer did not see her leave, but according to
FADE TO BLACK: James Hurley she snuck out of the house on foot and met
FADE TO BLACK: him here near the Roadhouse on Highway 21 ...
FADE TO BLACK: 56. EXT. ROAD - NIGHT
FADE TO BLACK: MOS flashback. Laura hops on the back of James bike and they ride off.
FADE TO BLACK: 57. INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
FADE TO BLACK: Cooper holds up Laura's diary.
FADE TO BLACK: In her diary, Laura had written "nervous about meeting
FADE TO BLACK: "J" tonite." I now believe this was a reference to James
FADE TO BLACK: Hurley, she was nervous because she planned to tell him
FADE TO BLACK: she didn't want to see him anymore.
FADE TO BLACK: They drove up into the woods near the Old Sawmill
FADE TO BLACK: road ... their conversation lasted approximately two
FADE TO BLACK: hours. James drove them back down the hill.
FADE TO BLACK: 58. EXT. ROAD - NIGHT
FADE TO BLACK: MOS flashblack. James stops the bike. Laura screams something at him and jumps off. He
FADE TO BLACK: tries to pursue her and she runs away.
FADE TO BLACK: COOPER'S VOICE
FADE TO BLACK: At 12:30, at the intersection of Sparkwood and 21,
FADE TO BLACK: Laura jumped off the bike and ran away.
FADE TO BLACK: 59. INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
FADE TO BLACK: This much we know as fact. What follows now is our
FADE TO BLACK: best reconstruction.
FADE TO BLACK: Nods to Albert.
FADE TO BLACK: Laura left Sparkwood and 21 on foot, to an unspecified
FADE TO BLACK: location, where, as prearranged ...
FADE TO BLACK: 60. EXT. ROAD - NIGHT
FADE TO BLACK: MOS flashback. Laura moves around a dark corner, comes upon Leo Johnson standing next
FADE TO BLACK: to his Corvette, smoking cigarette. He grabs her, roughs her up a little, indicates she's late.
FADE TO BLACK: She kisses him. He puts her in the car and they drive off.
FADE TO BLACK: ALBERT'S VOICE
FADE TO BLACK: ... she met Leo Johnson, the person who called her earlier.
FADE TO BLACK: They drove off together.
FADE TO BLACK: 61. INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
FADE TO BLACK: Do you still want me to point?
FADE TO BLACK: I so wish you would.
FADE TO BLACK: Yes, Lucy.
FADE TO BLACK: Leo Johnson was Laura's source for cocaine. He was also
FADE TO BLACK: involved in Laura's bunco scheme, come-ins for cash in
FADE TO BLACK: "Flesh World" magazine, with ads featuring pictures of
FADE TO BLACK: both Laura and Ronette Pulaski.
FADE TO BLACK: He holds up an order edition of "Flesh World" pointing out the item in question.
FADE TO BLACK: And thanks to Deputy Andy Brennan's fine eye for
FADE TO BLACK: detail, we now know that an ad featuring a picture of
FADE TO BLACK: 61. CONTINUED:
FADE TO BLACK: Theresa Banks, the killer's first victim ran in the six
FADE TO BLACK: editions of "Flesh World" before her death a year ago.
FADE TO BLACK: Under Laura's ring fingernail we found the letter "r".
FADE TO BLACK: Lucy points to the letter "r" written on the board, then the letter "t."
FADE TO BLACK: Under Theresa's ring fingernail was found the letter "t."
FADE TO BLACK: Positive triangulate linkage.
FADE TO BLACK: Andy beams. Lucy sniffles again.
FADE TO BLACK: Good work, Andy. Woof.
FADE TO BLACK: Leo drove Laura to a location somewhere near the Pearl
FADE TO BLACK: Lakes off Highway J, at the foot of the trail leading to
FADE TO BLACK: Jacques Renault's cabin.
FADE TO BLACK: Lucy points again.
FADE TO BLACK: ... they met Jacques and Ronnette Pulaski here and
FADE TO BLACK: climbed the trail to Jacques' cabin, where they were
FADE TO BLACK: heard passing by the cabin of Margaret the Log Lady.
FADE TO BLACK: They reached the cabin at approximately one a.m. They
FADE TO BLACK: partied; drugs and liquor were consumed. Laura was
FADE TO BLACK: tied up and had sexual relations with both Leo and
FADE TO BLACK: Jacques. Waldo, Jacques's bird, was let out of his cage
FADE TO BLACK: and attacked Laura. Leo and Jacques fought. Jacques
FADE TO BLACK: went outside and passed out. When he came to, Leo and
FADE TO BLACK: the girls were gone.
FADE TO BLACK: Cooper rises stiffly.
FADE TO BLACK: The Log Lady heard a Third Man pass by her cabin,
FADE TO BLACK: go up the hill. This Third Man witnessed the events
FADE TO BLACK: in the cabin, watching through a window.
FADE TO BLACK: There were footprints outside the one window with a
FADE TO BLACK: clear view of the room.
FADE TO BLACK: I believe that after his fight with Jacques, Leo left the
FADE TO BLACK: 61. CONTINUED:
FADE TO BLACK: cabin, alone, walked back to his car and drove off.
FADE TO BLACK: Laura was still tied up when the Third Man entered the
FADE TO BLACK: cabin.
FADE TO BLACK: It wasn't Jacques or Leo?
FADE TO BLACK: Laura had ten thousand dollars in her safe deposit box. I
FADE TO BLACK: believe that was drug money she owed to Leo. Leo
FADE TO BLACK: wouldn't have killed her without first collecting that
FADE TO BLACK: money. Leo also has an ironclad alibi for the night
FADE TO BLACK: Theresa Banks was murdered. He was in jail, in Twin
FADE TO BLACK: Peaks, on an assault charge.
FADE TO BLACK: The Third Man took Laura and Ronette to the train car,
FADE TO BLACK: here, on foot, a mile and half away.
FADE TO BLACK: Lucy points.
FADE TO BLACK: He wore surgical gloves, he was thorough, he was careful.
FADE TO BLACK: The girls did not struggle until they were inside.
FADE TO BLACK: Suggesting they knew the man.
FADE TO BLACK: They were tied up again at the train car; Laura for the
FADE TO BLACK: second time, Ronette for the first.
FADE TO BLACK: Finley's fine twine.
FADE TO BLACK: A generic household brand, available in most stores. He
FADE TO BLACK: was also smart.
FADE TO BLACK: 62. INT. TRAIN CAR - NIGHT
FADE TO BLACK: MOS flashback. Lit by a candle. We see a SHADOWY FIGURE strike Ronette. She falls
FADE TO BLACK: to the ground. We see the figure advance on Laura. A knife gleams.
FADE TO BLACK: 62. CONTINUED:
FADE TO BLACK: ALBERT'S VOICE
FADE TO BLACK: The Man struck Ronette once with a blunt object,
FADE TO BLACK: knocking her unconscious. Then he killed Laura. He
FADE TO BLACK: took his time; over an hour.
FADE TO BLACK: 63. INT. CONFERENCE ROOM
FADE TO BLACK: During the course of which, Ronette came to, managed
FADE TO BLACK: to crawl out of the cabin into the woods and eventually
FADE TO BLACK: to safety. The Man didn't know or didn't care that
FADE TO BLACK: Ronette was gone.
FADE TO BLACK: He cleaned up. He built a mound of dirt, just as he had
FADE TO BLACK: with Theresa Banks. He left a note written in Laura's
FADE TO BLACK: blood. Washed his hands in the rainwater pooled
FADE TO BLACK: outside. My men also found these outside ...
FADE TO BLACK: Holds up an evidence bag containing water damaged scraps of paper.
FADE TO BLACK: Scraps of paper. Hand torn, scattered around the area.
FADE TO BLACK: Ink washed away by the rain. Commercial quality.
FADE TO BLACK: From what?
FADE TO BLACK: Letters? Personal papers?
FADE TO BLACK: Attempting to implicate Leo Johnson, he wrapped
FADE TO BLACK: Laura's body in plastic that was taken from Leo's house
FADE TO BLACK: or car. He carried the body to Elk River a quarter
FADE TO BLACK: of a mile away and threw her in.
FADE TO BLACK: Lucy is too saddened to point. Cooper points.
FADE TO BLACK: The body floated downriver into Black Lake and
FADE TO BLACK: washed up outside the Blue Pine Lodge.
FADE TO BLACK: 64. EXT. BLACK LAKE - DAWN
FADE TO BLACK: The body lying on the rocky shore.
FADE TO BLACK: 65. INT. CONFERENCE- ROOM.
FADE TO BLACK: Harry, Lucy and the deputies are speechless. Andy starts to cry. Lucy wants to embrace him,
FADE TO BLACK: realizes she can't and has to leave the room.
FADE TO BLACK: ... I'm sorry.
FADE TO BLACK: Harry pats him gently on the back.
FADE TO BLACK: It's what we call a three-hankie crime.
FADE TO BLACK: You think you're so smart - why don't you just shut up!
FADE TO BLACK: Everyone's surprised by Andy's outburst, no one more so than Andy. Andy exits. Albert
FADE TO BLACK: smiles.
FADE TO BLACK: Who's the Third Man?
FADE TO BLACK: That's the next thing we have to find out.
FADE TO BLACK: 
FADE TO BLACK: 66. EXT. BLUE PINE LODGE - NIGHT
FADE TO BLACK: Truman's cruiser pulls up outside.
FADE TO BLACK: 67. INT. BLUE. LODGE - NIGHT
FADE TO BLACK: Pete and Harry Truman enter. Pete's had better days.
FADE TO BLACK: I sure appreciate the ride, Harry.
FADE TO BLACK: No problem.
FADE TO BLACK: Smoke inhalation's a nasty business; I feel like
FADE TO BLACK: somebody taped my lips to the tailpipe of a bus.
FADE TO BLACK: Pete sits wearily down at the kitchen counter, wipes his brow.
FADE TO BLACK: Can I get you something to wet your whistle?
FADE TO BLACK: I'm feeling a little reckless; there's be a couple 'a ginger
FADE TO BLACK: beers in the fridge.
FADE TO BLACK: Truman gets the drinks. Pete finds a note the counter, in an envelope addressed to him.
FADE TO BLACK: So Pete ... where the hell is Josie?
FADE TO BLACK: Truman sets down the drink on the counter. Pete opens the envelope.
FADE TO BLACK: Maybe this'll tell you.
FADE TO BLACK: "Dear Pete, I had to leave the town on an emergency of
FADE TO BLACK: business to Seattle. I will phone you when I arrive.
FADE TO BLACK: Hope you did a good day at the mill; there is ginger
FADE TO BLACK: beer in the refridge ... love, Josie." There you go.
FADE TO BLACK: When did you see her last?
FADE TO BLACK: I didn't see her at all yesterday. 'Note's dated
FADE TO BLACK: yesterday afternoon.
FADE TO BLACK: No forwarding number? No way to tell her about the
FADE TO BLACK: mill?
FADE TO BLACK: No. She heads over to Seattle once every three months
FADE TO BLACK: or so. Want my opinion she goes there to indulge a
FADE TO BLACK: secret vice.
FADE TO BLACK: What is it?
FADE TO BLACK: Shopping. Comes back with half a department store.
FADE TO BLACK: He chuckles. Sees Truman hasn't moved off his concern.
FADE TO BLACK: Guess we're both a little sweet on her.
FADE TO BLACK: Truman nods. Next piece of business.
FADE TO BLACK: Pete. We haven't found Catherine.
FADE TO BLACK: Yeah. 'Figured.
FADE TO BLACK: The last place anybody saw her's under fifty tons of
FADE TO BLACK: twisted steel. It could take weeks to sift through. You
FADE TO BLACK: can hope for the best, but you ought to prepare or the
FADE TO BLACK: worst.
FADE TO BLACK: Pete nods. It hits him.
FADE TO BLACK: Oh dear...
FADE TO BLACK: 67. CONTINUED:
FADE TO BLACK: If there's anything I can do to help ...
FADE TO BLACK: Pause.
FADE TO BLACK: Always thought I'd be the first to go. If you'd laid
FADE TO BLACK: odds on the last person standing in a nuclear war I
FADE TO BLACK: would'a bet on her.
FADE TO BLACK: I'm so sorry.
FADE TO BLACK: No point in mincing words. She was hell to live with.
FADE TO BLACK: But once there was a little bit of heaven there, too.
FADE TO BLACK: She was tough.
FADE TO BLACK: Oh God. This'll take a while to sink in, I suppose.
FADE TO BLACK: Suppose it will.
FADE TO BLACK: Oh God. I loved her. God help her miserable soul, I
FADE TO BLACK: loved her.
FADE TO BLACK: He breaks down. Truman tries to comfort him. The phone rings. Truman answers it.
FADE TO BLACK: Packard residence.
INTERCUT: 
INTERCUT: 68. INT. GREAT NORTHERN HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT
INTERCUT: The ASIAN MAN we saw checking into the hotel in episode 006 is on a phone in the lobby.
INTERCUT: Could I speak to Josie Packard please?
INTERCUT: I'm sorry, she's not here right now -
INTERCUT: 68. CONTINUED:
INTERCUT: Can you tell me when she'll be back?
INTERCUT: She's out of town. I can try and get a message to her;
INTERCUT: who should I say is calling?
INTERCUT: The Asian Man hangs up. We stay with him. He thinks. He picks up the phone and dials.
INTERCUT: I'd like to place an international call please ... collect to
INTERCUT: Hong Kong.
INTERCUT: Behind him, elevator doors open; Ben and Jerry emerge. Jerry's carrying a small box. We
INTERCUT: stay with them.
INTERCUT: - I read all about it in this French magazine they take
INTERCUT: the entire head, they dip it in this kind of blancmange
INTERCUT: pudding, roll it in oats, stuff it full of walnuts, hot rocks
INTERCUT: and a spice bouquet, wrap it in a papilliote, seal the
INTERCUT: edges with a sugar glaze and bake it under glass.
INTERCUT: Sounds incredible.
INTERCUT: It is to die for.
INTERCUT: Have you seen Audrey today?
INTERCUT: No, I haven't.
INTERCUT: They head down the corridor.
INTERCUT: 69. INT. BEN HORNE'S OFFICE - NIGHT
INTERCUT: Someone's waiting in the office. As Ben and Jerry enter, the figure turns; Hank Jennings.
INTERCUT: - open a separate offshore account, see if the sons of
INTERCUT: Odin will go for a wire transfer directly to Grand
INTERCUT: Cayman -
INTERCUT: No paper trail.
INTERCUT: Jerry sets his box down and starts to carefully open it.
INTERCUT: Not even a ripple; we run the cash through a quick spin
INTERCUT: and rinse, convert it to bearer bonds which we are
INTERCUT: prepared to hand over to her as soon Josie gives us a John
INTERCUT: Hancock -
INTERCUT: - and where exactly is the fragrant pearl of the East?
INTERCUT: She took a powder last night.
INTERCUT: Prearranged?
INTERCUT: She wanted a little distance between her and the smell of
INTERCUT: smoke. She'll be back as soon as it blows over.
INTERCUT: Sound strategy. You're keeping a tight leash?
INTERCUT: I gave her something to think about.
INTERCUT: Your other business with her is satisfactorily concluded?
INTERCUT: The short answer is yes.
INTERCUT: Jerry offers the contents of his box: candied apples.
INTERCUT: Boys, a local work of genius: tree-ripened Granny
INTERCUT: Smith's, dipped in hot, hand-pulled creme caramel,
INTERCUT: dusted with crushed nuts and a dark coco powder.
INTERCUT: Enjoy.
INTERCUT: They each eagerly take one and bite in. The caramel slows down their speech.
INTERCUT: 69. CONTINUED:
INTERCUT: A phenomenal taste sensation.
INTERCUT: Huh? Huh?
INTERCUT: Very good.
INTERCUT: Next business: Leo Johnson.
INTERCUT: He's in a coma. Looks like brain damage.
INTERCUT: With Leo, how could they tell?
INTERCUT: Why isn't he on the last train to the Elysian Fields?
INTERCUT: I caught him center-shot with a .44. Couldn't risk going
INTERCUT: inside. The neighborhood was hot, I had to sneak past
INTERCUT: patrols as it was.
INTERCUT: Did he see you?
INTERCUT: Negative. He was chopping wood.
INTERCUT: Inside?
INTERCUT: Hey. You know Leo.
INTERCUT: What else? Catherine Packard: dead?
INTERCUT: My call put her in the drying shed when it went up.
INTERCUT: Sounds like she's buried in the wreckage.
INTERCUT: 69. CONTINUED:
INTERCUT: Heat like that they'll be lucky to find teeth.
INTERCUT: Marvelous. If they don't hang the arson on the late,
INTERCUT: lamented Catherine and her "co-conspirator" Leo I'll
INTERCUT: give up sex.
INTERCUT: That's ... confidence.
INTERCUT: Hank lifts Catherine's illicit mill ledger off the desk.
INTERCUT: What do we do with the ledger?
INTERCUT: Hank ... leave the creative thinking to the brothers Horne.
INTERCUT: You're a bicep; relax until we say flex ...
INTERCUT: Jerry feels Hank's muscle; impressive.
INTERCUT: You guys.
INTERCUT: 70. EXT. PALMER HOUSE - NIGHT
INTERCUT: 71. INT. PALMER HOUSE - NIGHT
INTERCUT: Sarah and Leland are dressed for an evening out. Leland is deftly spinning Sarah around the
INTERCUT: room with a few light dance steps, humming some public domain tune. Sarah is smiling and
INTERCUT: enjoying it in spite of herself.
INTERCUT: Maddy and Donna watch from the doorway to the room. Leland finishes the dance.
INTERCUT: Come on, doll, let's paint the town.
INTERCUT: Leland, I don't know what's gotten in to you.
INTERCUT: That old black magic's got me in its spell.
INTERCUT: Something has, that much is for sure.
INTERCUT: Girls, you should have seen Sarah dance. We used to win
INTERCUT: all the dance contests down at the Grange Hall; the other
INTERCUT: couples would see us coming and just walk off the floor.
INTERCUT: Leland ...
INTERCUT: It's true - isn't it true?
INTERCUT: We won't be late.
INTERCUT: Say hi to the Haywards for me.
INTERCUT: I'll probably see you over there.
INTERCUT: Leland gives Maddy a kiss, dances Sarah through the archway towards the front door,
INTERCUT: humming another tune.
INTERCUT: I half expected him to start dancing up the walls like
INTERCUT: Fred Astaire.
INTERCUT: It's nice to see them enjoying themselves.
INTERCUT: Donna pulls out a list; they sit on the sofa.
INTERCUT: So listen, I got hold of the list of Meals on Wheels
INTERCUT: clients that Laura used to visit. It used to be nine, now
INTERCUT: it's eight since old Mr. Pendergast died.
INTERCUT: 71. CONTINUED:
INTERCUT: What are you gonna do?
INTERCUT: I told Norma I'd take over the deliveries tomorrow,
INTERCUT: I'll spend some time with everybody on her route ...
INTERCUT: She unfolds a small town map.
INTERCUT: I put x's on all the addresses. One of these eight
INTERCUT: people must have sent me that note; that means they
INTERCUT: know something. We just have to figure out who it was.
INTERCUT: As Donna concentrates over her map, Maddy feels an odd, disquieting feeling come over her.
INTERCUT: She tries to shake it off, can't. SOUND of Donna's voice grows fainter.
INTERCUT: Laura never talked much about them. Guess we know by
INTERCUT: now that doesn't necessarily mean there wasn't anything
INTERCUT: weird about them ...
INTERCUT: Maddy turns slowly and looks into the alcove of the living room. Standing there, stock still,
INTERCUT: is BOB, the grey-haired man we've seen in Cooper's dream and Mrs. Palmer's vision.
INTERCUT: Maddy's frozen with fear. Donna doesn't immediately notice. Maddy starts to tremble,
INTERCUT: unable to speak. Bob doesn't move. He just looks at her.
INTERCUT: Donna finally notices her distress.
INTERCUT: Maddy? ... Maddy?
INTERCUT: Huh?
INTERCUT: What is it? What's wrong?
INTERCUT: Maddy just looks at her, looks back. Bob is gone.

FADE TO BLACK: 72. EXT. HAYWARD'S HOUSE - NIGHT
FADE TO BLACK: 73. INT. HAYWARD'S HOUSE - NIGHT
FADE TO BLACK: Dinner is just breaking up in the dining room. Sarah Palmer is helping EILEEN HAYWARD
FADE TO BLACK: clear the table.
FADE TO BLACK: Here, you can just put some of the dishes in my lap.
FADE TO BLACK: Oh, no, I don't mind, it's no trouble.
FADE TO BLACK: Now Eileen, I've been looking forward to one of your
FADE TO BLACK: deserts all day; I hope you won't disappoint me.
FADE TO BLACK: Leland, you know me better than that.
FADE TO BLACK: I'll give you a hand.
FADE TO BLACK: Eileen wheels towards the kitchen; Sarah follows.
FADE TO BLACK: Let's put on a pot of decaf.
FADE TO BLACK: I've got both if you want regular.
FADE TO BLACK: They're gone. Leland looks over at Doc. Doc's got an elbow on the table, propping up his
FADE TO BLACK: chin. He's sound asleep. His chin slips, he wakes with a start.
FADE TO BLACK: Long day, Will?
FADE TO BLACK: I feel like I've sat through back to back operas.
FADE TO BLACK: Terrible about the mill.
FADE TO BLACK: 73. CONTINUED:
FADE TO BLACK: They say over a hundred and fifty jobs may be lost.
FADE TO BLACK: Awful.
FADE TO BLACK: I suppose that opens the door for Ben Horne and his big
FADE TO BLACK: development plans.
FADE TO BLACK: As his lawyer, and yours, of course I can't comment.
FADE TO BLACK: As your doctor, Leland, what the hell happened to your
FADE TO BLACK: hair?
FADE TO BLACK: Isn't it strange? I woke up this morning, looked in the
FADE TO BLACK: mirror and there it was, literally changed overnight.
FADE TO BLACK: Considering all you've been through ...
FADE TO BLACK: It's a funny thing, though. Seeing it I seemed to realize
FADE TO BLACK: I'd turned a corner somehow. I felt a great deal of
FADE TO BLACK: sadness still, yes, but it wasn't as overwhelming; I
FADE TO BLACK: actual physcially felt as if a large weight had been
FADE TO BLACK: lifted from my heart.
FADE TO BLACK: Perhaps it has.
FADE TO BLACK: Perhaps it has. God, I feel like singing.
FADE TO BLACK: That would be very nice. We always enjoy hearing you
FADE TO BLACK: sing, Leland.
FADE TO BLACK: You know me, Will; it was either law school or
FADE TO BLACK: Broadway.
FADE TO BLACK: Eileen and Sarah return from the kitchen, bearing coffee and desert.
FADE TO BLACK: Eileen, Leland would like to favor us with a song.
FADE TO BLACK: Oh, I'd really enjoy that.
FADE TO BLACK: Sarah?
FADE TO BLACK: Of course, dear.
FADE TO BLACK: Let's move into the living room, shall we?
FADE TO BLACK: They do. Doc sits facing the piano. Eileen beside him. Sarah sits down at the piano. Leland
FADE TO BLACK: whispers something to her, she nods.
FADE TO BLACK: Excuse me just one second.
FADE TO BLACK: Leland disappears into the foyer for a moment. Sarah gets a signal from him and starts to
FADE TO BLACK: play the intro to "Get Happy."
FADE TO BLACK: Leland enters with a hat and cane. He sings "Get Happy," hoofs a little, not inexpertly. Doc
FADE TO BLACK: and Eileen seem to enoy it a great deal. As he enters the second verse Leland's tempo picks
FADE TO BLACK: up and accelerates, heading towards manic. Sarah has trouble keeping up.
FADE TO BLACK: Doc and Eileen try to smile through it. At the end of the second verse, at fever pitch, Leland
FADE TO BLACK: keels over and passes out on the floor. Doc and Sarah rush to him.
FADE TO BLACK: Oh dear ...
FADE TO BLACK: Doc loosens Leland's collar, slaps his checks.
FADE TO BLACK: Sarah, if you could just get me my bag.
FADE TO BLACK: Eileen is alreay wheeling her way to them with it.
FADE TO BLACK: Got it right here.
FADE TO BLACK: I'm sure it's nothing serious ...
FADE TO BLACK: 73. CONTINUED:
FADE TO BLACK: Doc rummages through his bag for some smelling salts.
FADE TO BLACK: He's been singing all day. Mostly old songs.
FADE TO BLACK: Doc waves some of the salts in front of Leland's nose. He immediately revives, looks up at
FADE TO BLACK: them all and smiles.
FADE TO BLACK: I feel fine. I feel fine.
FADE TO BLACK: They look at him.
FADE TO BLACK: 74. EXT. ONE-EYED JACK'S - NIGHT
FADE TO BLACK: 75. INT. ONE-EYED JACK'S BEDROOM NIGHT
FADE TO BLACK: A frightened and bewildered, and slightly brusied, Audrey lies on her bed.
FADE TO BLACK: Agent Cooper ... are you there? ... I left you a note,
FADE TO BLACK: didn't you read my note? ... I slipped it under your
FADE TO BLACK: door, you must have seen it ... well, I'm up here at One-
FADE TO BLACK: Eyed Jack's, and to be perfectly honest, I think I'm in a
FADE TO BLACK: little over my head ...
FADE TO BLACK: Not that I can't handle it. I mean, if I'm going to help
FADE TO BLACK: you with your investigations, I'm sure I'll be put into
FADE TO BLACK: situations a lot dangerous than this on a fairly
FADE TO BLACK: regular basis. It's just, you know, the first time out I
FADE TO BLACK: wouldn't mind a little expert guidance ...
FADE TO BLACK: Just so you know, there is a connection between Horne's
FADE TO BLACK: department store and One-Eyed Jack; it's my father. He
FADE TO BLACK: owns the place. A little ball of sleeze named Battis
FADE TO BLACK: recruits some of the girls at the perfume counter.
FADE TO BLACK: Tomorrow I'm going to try to find out if Laura and
FADE TO BLACK: Ronette came up here ...
FADE TO BLACK: I hope you won't think any less of me for trying to help
FADE TO BLACK: 75. CONTINUED:
FADE TO BLACK: you. I promise I only did it with the best intentions.
FADE TO BLACK: And if there's anyway in the world you can hear me
FADE TO BLACK: tonight ... please help me ...
FADE TO BLACK: 76. INT. COOPER'S ROOM - NIGHT
FADE TO BLACK: Cooper exits his bathroom, moving very stiffly. He sits painfully on the side of the bed and
FADE TO BLACK: takes a handful of aspirins with his glass of warm milk. He picks up his tape recorder.
FADE TO BLACK: Diane, it's 11:55 p.m., approximately nineteen hours
FADE TO BLACK: since the shooting incident that nearly caused me to
FADE TO BLACK: make a premature purchase of the proverbial farm.
FADE TO BLACK: There's every reason to think I'll make a complete
FADE TO BLACK: recovery, which I would like to get a good jump out of
FADE TO BLACK: the blocks on by sleeping solidly for at least eight or
FADE TO BLACK: nine hours ... a man can only go so long without
FADE TO BLACK: submitting to a period of rest ...
FADE TO BLACK: As he speaks, he puts in his ear plugs.
FADE TO BLACK: ... for as we know from experiments performed on
FADE TO BLACK: American GI's during the Korean War, sleep deprivation
FADE TO BLACK: is a one-way ticket to temporary psychosis and I'm
FADE TO BLACK: working on a three day jag. I got so goofy last night as I
FADE TO BLACK: was lying here wondering whether I was going to live or
FADE TO BLACK: die that I thought I saw a giant in my room, but perhaps
FADE TO BLACK: I'll save that story for another time.
FADE TO BLACK: This is me, room 315 of the Great Northern Hotel,
FADE TO BLACK: signing off.
FADE TO BLACK: Cooper puts a sleep mask and turns off the lamp. He lies still for a moment. He thinks he
FADE TO BLACK: feels a weight settle on the end of the bed. He turns, senses sometrhing. He lifts the corner of
FADE TO BLACK: the sleep mask and sees ...
FADE TO BLACK: ... the Giant is back. Sitting at the end of the bed.
FADE TO BLACK: Sorry to wake you.
FADE TO BLACK: I wasn't asleep. I'm not asleep. Then I'm not dreaming.
FADE TO BLACK: 76. CONTINUED:
FADE TO BLACK: I forgot to tell you something.
FADE TO BLACK: You were right about Jacques. The big rubber bag.
FADE TO BLACK: The things I tell you will not be wrong.
FADE TO BLACK: Cooper's about to ask another question. The Giant raises his huge hand to still him.
FADE TO BLACK: Better to listen than to talk.
FADE TO BLACK: I believe you.
FADE TO BLACK: Don't search for all the answers at once. A path is
FADE TO BLACK: formed by laying one stone at a time.
FADE TO BLACK: Coopers nods.
FADE TO BLACK: One person saw the Third Man. Three have seen him,
FADE TO BLACK: yes, but not his body. One only. Known to you. Ready
FADE TO BLACK: now to speak.
FADE TO BLACK: Coopers wants to speak, bites his tongue. Nods.
FADE TO BLACK: One more thing. You forgot something.
FADE TO BLACK: What?
FADE TO BLACK: The Giant waves goodbye to him.
FADE TO BLACK: Cooper leans over to turn on the lamp. The Giant is gone.

FLASHBACK: A hand ripping the half-heart necklace from around Laura's neck.
FLASHBACK: A finger dipped in blood, writing the note.
FLASHBACK: A hand picking up a heavy wrench and advancing towards us.
FLASHBACK: And the wrench is raised threateningly above us.
FLASHBACK: And we see him. Bob, the grey-haired man. He swings the wrench down at us.
FLASHBACK: 80. INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT
FLASHBACK: Ronette's eyes open and dart around wildly. She makes a horrible sound. She's out of the
FLASHBACK: coma.
