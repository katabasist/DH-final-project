REVISED: 1. EXT. TWIN PEAKS HOSPITAL - DAWN
REVISED: 2. INT. RONETTE PULASKI'S HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
REVISED: SHERIFF TRUMAN is turning off the alarm on the INTRAVENOUS feeding monitor,
REVISED: the pole holding the intravenous bag is lying on the floor, the bag still connected to it. A
REVISED: screaming RONETTE is being restrained by two NURSES, as DALE COOPER and
REVISED: ALBERT ROSENFIELD arrive in the doorway.
REVISED: Ronette got out of bed a while ago, pulled out her IV -
REVISED: Cooper moves to her. Albert examines the IV bag. The contents are tinted blue.
REVISED: Looks like dye.
REVISED: Cooper takes out a pair of tweezers.
REVISED: Hold her down, Harry. Albert, get your microscope.
REVISED: Albert opens his case, takes out a FIELD MICROSCOPE. Cooper takes out a pair of
REVISED: tweezers, lifts Ronette's left hand. Her ring finger is bruised and bloodied under the nail.
REVISED: Hold on, Ronette. Hold on.
REVISED: Cooper goes in with the tweezers. She screams.
REVISED: 3. ALBERT'S MICROSCOPE: A SMALL LETTER
REVISED: A piece of paper with the letter "B" on it.
REVISED: He's been here.
REVISED: 2.003 Revised 8-1-90, CHERRY
REVISED: 3. CONTINUED:
REVISED: We had a 24 hour guard.
REVISED: Nevertheless, he did this and he tried to taint her IV.
REVISED: Maybe her screams scared him away.
REVISED: Maybe she heard a Sousa March and was looking for her
REVISED: baton. I'll do a work-up on the IV.
REVISED: It was our man. The letters were never made public.
REVISED: Fellas ... let's stand together for a moment ... it's time I
REVISED: mentioned something to you I'm not sure ...
REVISED: but I believe I was visited by a Giant.
REVISED: In my room. Twice. He gave me three clues; the first
REVISED: had to do with Jacques in his body bag and came true
REVISED: almost immediately. The second was "the owls are not
REVISED: what they seem," and the third was about a man who
REVISED: points without chemicals.
REVISED: They look at him.
REVISED: Any relation to the dwarf?
REVISED: You were visited by a giant?
REVISED: 4. EXT. HAROLD SMITH'S APARTMENT - DAY 4.
REVISED: DONNA HAYWARD stands nervously outside the door. From inside we can hear a piano
REVISED: concerto. Chopin. Before Donna can knock, HAROLD SMITH opens the door. He is
REVISED: handsome, late 20's, dressed comfortably. Smith seems to be inspecting her in a gentle,
REVISED: caressing way.
REVISED: You're wearing a different dress than yesterday. A better
REVISED: color for you.
REVISED: I've forgotten my manners. I'm Harold Smith.
REVISED: 4. CONTINUED:
REVISED: I guess you know who I am.
REVISED: Smith nods, swings the door open wider. Donna walks into his apartment.
REVISED: 5. INT. SMITH'S APARTMENT - DAY
REVISED: The front room of Smith's apartment. Neurotically neat, but comfortable. An interior
REVISED: window looks in on an inner room, obscured by curtains.
REVISED: Please, sit down. Would you like some lemonade? I
REVISED: also have a little apple butter and some saltines.
REVISED: No thanks.
REVISED: Smith sits. She sits across from him.
REVISED: Don't be nervous, Donna.
REVISED: I'm not nervous. I'm curious.
REVISED: Curious about my relationship with Laura.
REVISED: Why did you send me that letter?
REVISED: Laura wanted me to get in touch with you if anything
REVISED: ever happened to her.
REVISED: Why?
REVISED: She said you would ask a lot of questions.
REVISED: A Chesire cat smile. Donna decides to slow down.
REVISED: 5. CONTINUED:
REVISED: You don't seem much like a shut in.
REVISED: You mean, politely, what's the matter with me?
REVISED: Okay.
REVISED: I don't like to go outside. I ... can't. Do you have a
REVISED: judgement about that you'd like to express?
REVISED: No.
REVISED: Donna notices a piece of paper sticking out from under what appears to be the solid edge of a
REVISED: bookshelf
REVISED: Laura said you were very fair-minded.
REVISED: If you knew her so well, why didn't she ever mention you
REVISED: to me?
REVISED: She liked to think of me ... as a mystery in her life.
REVISED: Then why did you call me?
REVISED: I am ... I used to be a horticulturist. I raise orchids.
REVISED: That's why it's so warm. in here. Laura always admired
REVISED: them. I wrote you because I wanted to know if you'd be
REVISED: kind enough to place one of them on her grave.
REVISED: Of course.
REVISED: Excuse me just a moment.
REVISED: He goes into an adjoining room. The door is heavy, with a substantial lock. Donna rises
REVISED: quickly, goes to the bookshelf, tugs on the piece of paper. It won't budge. She notices a gap
REVISED: between the shelf and the wall, moves closer to take a look, then turns abruptly as the heavy
REVISED: door opens behind her and Smith re-enters, carrying, a beautiful orchid plant. He conceals
REVISED: any concern about her movements.
REVISED: 5. CONTINUED:
REVISED: This is a hybrid; a lady-slipper.
REVISED: It's beautiful.
REVISED: Take it, please.
REVISED: My last gift to Laura.
REVISED: That's very kind of you, Mr. Smith.
REVISED: Harold. Laura was very kind to me.
REVISED: Why don't you like to go outside?
REVISED: If I knew the answer to that ...
REVISED: (looks at her, a sweet, aching look of longing;
REVISED: then has to look away)
REVISED: Forgive me ...
REVISED: What?
REVISED: You're every bit as lovely as Laura said you were
REVISED: I'll be back.
REVISED: I'll be here.
REVISED: He smiles. She smiles, exits.
REVISED: 6. SHERIFF'S STATION - DAY
REVISED: 2.003 Revised 7-27-90, GREEN
REVISED: 7. INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
REVISED: Cooper is taping the poster of the LONG HAIRED MAN on to the blackboard. Below the
REVISED: poster he writes the letters B, R, and T. Truman and Rosenfield watch.
REVISED: R-B-T: I believe these letters and the giant's clues are in
REVISED: some way connected to the long haired man.
REVISED: Mrs. Palmer saw him in a vision. She called this
REVISED: morning to say Laura's cousin, Maddy Ferguson, has seen
REVISED: the man twice in the last three days, also in a vision. I
REVISED: saw him in my dream.
REVISED: And Ronnette -
REVISED: - saw him physically in the train car. Four of us have
REVISED: seen this man in different forms.
REVISED: The path is a psychic link that will lead us to this man.
REVISED: So what did the giant sound like? Kind of a big
REVISED: booming voice?
REVISED: No. He spoke very softly, directly and distinctly.
REVISED: And you gave him the beans you were supposed to use to
REVISED: buy a cow.
REVISED: No, I gave him my ring.
REVISED: Albert deadpans, opens his briefcase on the table and goes to work.
REVISED: Confining my conclusions to the planet Earth ...
REVISED: 2.003 Revised 8-1-90, CHERRY
REVISED: 7. CONTINUED:
REVISED: Albert takes out THREE SMALL PACKETS OF COCAINE.
REVISED: The cocaine you found in James Hurley's gas tank is a
REVISED: match to what we found in Jacques' car and at Leo
REVISED: Johnson's house. Get the picture?
REVISED: I've even got the frame.
REVISED: The handywork of Leo Johnson, currently appearing at
REVISED: Calhoun Memorial Hospital as Mr. Potato Head.
REVISED: The boots are a CircleBrand rare work boot. The ones
REVISED: we found haven't been worn or tampered with. The
REVISED: letter "B" from Ronette's finger was cut from a copy of
REVISED: Fleshworld. A perfect match. This edition features a
REVISED: swingers club for double amputees. No comment.
REVISED: Albert points to the poster of the long-haired man.
REVISED: We sent the portrait of our long haired man to every
REVISED: agency from NASA to DEA and came up empty. This
REVISED: cat is in nobody's data base.
REVISED: A man four of us have seen here in Twin Peaks.
REVISED: By the way, you were shot with a Walther PPK. James
REVISED: Bond's gun.
REVISED: The trail of who shot you is cold, Coop, but I hoovered
REVISED: some fibers from the corridor outside your room. My
REVISED: ticket out of Trolleyville. I'm headed back to the lab.
REVISED: Albert snaps his briefcase closed.
REVISED: Anything we should be working on?
REVISED: Practice walking without dragging your knuckles on the
REVISED: 2.003 Revised 8-3-90, GOLDENROD
REVISED: 7. CONTINUED:
REVISED: floor.
REVISED: He moves to leave, but Truman blocks his path.
REVISED: Albert, you make fun of everyone and everything and
REVISED: then act like you deserve an award for it. That's just not
REVISED: right. Get out of here before I do something I won't
REVISED: regret. Again.
REVISED: While I will admit to a certain cynicism, the fact of the
REVISED: matter is I'm merely a naysayer and hatchet man in the
REVISED: fight against violence. I pride myself in taking a punch
REVISED: and would gladly take another because I choose to live
REVISED: my life in the company of Ghandi and King. My
REVISED: concerns are global. I reject absolutely revenge,
REVISED: aggression, and retaliation. The foundation of such a
REVISED: method is love. I love you, Sheriff Truman.
REVISED: Albert leaves. Truman turns to Cooper. A beat.
REVISED: Albert's path is a strange and difficult one.
REVISED: 8. OMITTED
REVISED: 9. INT. RECEPTION WAITING AREA - DAY
REVISED: Albert exits past reception where LUCY MORAN labors over the letters on the scrabble
REVISED: board in airing area. Cooper exits the room, finds HAWK with JAMES HURLEY,
REVISED: who's just up from lock-up. Cooper nods to Hawk, Hawk moves off.
REVISED: James, you aren't going to be charged. The cocaine in
REVISED: your bike did not belong to you -
REVISED: That's what I was trying to tell you -
REVISED: James, I don't want to see you down here again.
REVISED: Yes sir.
REVISED: You're a Bookhouse Boy. You have an obligation to obey
REVISED: 2.003 Revised 8-1-90, CHERRY
REVISED: 9. CONTINUED:
REVISED: the law. And you have people around you to turn to when
REVISED: you're in trouble; that's an obligation, too. Stop trying
REVISED: to figure it all out by yourself. Find somebody to talk
REVISED: to. Talk to me if you want.
REVISED: Go home, James.
REVISED: James nods and slowly exits. Cooper moves off.
REVISED: How's it going, Lucy?
REVISED: 75 words, wait a minute, 76 words ... 77. Oh, oh, that's 78.
REVISED: ... going good.
REVISED: A thumbs up and Cooper's down the corridor. Hawk wanders over to see what Lucy's up to.
REVISED: Agent Cooper has asked me to find as many words as I
REVISED: can that contain the letters B, T, and R.
REVISED: Let's see, I used to be pretty good at this.
REVISED: RICHARD TREMAYNE thirties, stuffy, in an ascot and tweed jacket, enters the station. He
REVISED: stops to look at the poster of the LONG HAIRED MAN, next to a NO SMOKING sign.
REVISED: My lunch date is here.
REVISED: This is the date that made Andy phone in sick?
REVISED: Lucy nods. Tremayne inserts a cigarette into a holder, turns, sees Lucy, moves to them.
REVISED: Ah, Lucy, there you are.
REVISED: Hello, Dick.
REVISED: Lucy, I have always considered you a woman of letters.
REVISED: 2.003 Revised 7-31-90, YELLOW
REVISED: 9A.
REVISED: 9. CONTINUED:
REVISED: Tremayne enjoys his own wit, lights up. Hawk looks at Lucy's letters. Makes a suggestion.
REVISED: "Prohibited."
REVISED: Hawk takes Tremayne's cigarette holder and snaps it in half.
REVISED: I say ...
REVISED: I don't believe we've met. Richard Tremayne, Horne's
REVISED: Department Store, designer men's wear?
REVISED: "Robot."
REVISED: Hawk goes to the conference room. Tremayne focuses on Lucy.
REVISED: Did I do something to anger him? Not that native
REVISED: people don't have enough reason to be angry per se -
REVISED: 2.003 Revised 8-1-90, CHERRY
REVISED: Let's go to lunch.
REVISED: Capital. I'm famished. We'll go dutch.
REVISED: On their way out, LELAND PALMER hurries in, carrying a rolled-up wanted poster.
REVISED: Lucy, is Agent Cooper here?
REVISED: Conference room.
REVISED: 10. INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
REVISED: Truman and Cooper are back on the giant. Hawk listens.
REVISED: So how tall was he exactly? Did his head hit the ceiling?
REVISED: Almost.
REVISED: I believe they have ten foot ceilings at the Great
REVISED: Northern.
REVISED: Leland hurries into the room.
REVISED: I'm sorry I hope I'm not interrupting -
REVISED: What is it, Leland?
REVISED: This man. I know him.
REVISED: How?
REVISED: 10. CONTINUED:
REVISED: When I was a boy my Grandfather had a summer house
REVISED: up at Pearl Lakes, we went there every year -
REVISED: You knew him there.
REVISED: Yes. Now, I know he wasn't a Chalbert. They were our
REVISED: neighbors on one side. On the other side was a vacant
REVISED: lot, then there was a white house. That's where he lived.
REVISED: Can you remember a name?
REVISED: I think ... I think it was Robertson.
REVISED: Cooper looks at the letters on the blackboard, then back at Leland.
REVISED: Robert. Robertson. That's what the letters are spelling,
REVISED: Hawk, get up to Pearl Lakes, find out who was in that
REVISED: other house -
REVISED: Not many folks up there this time of year.
REVISED: I'll do what I can.
REVISED: Hawk exits. Leland takes out a match book.
REVISED: Something else. He used to shoot matches at me. He'd
REVISED: say, "Do you want to play with fire, little boy?"
REVISED: He takes a match out of the book and puts it into his hand so that as he lights the march it
REVISED: will shoot out of his hand. He shoots a match that hits the window.
REVISED: That's our man.
FADE OUT: 
FADE OUT: 11. INT. GREAT NORTHERN LOBBY - DAY
FADE OUT: Cooper walks thru the busy lobby heading towards Ben Horn's office. The ASIAN MAN
FADE OUT: watches Cooper move thru the Lobby. As Cooper gets closer the man slowly pulls a
FADE OUT: newspaper up to cover his face.
FADE OUT: From the other direction, BEN HORNE enters, talking on a cellular phone.
FADE OUT: I can't hear you, Jerry, turn the radio down, Jerry ... well,
FADE OUT: then go to a room that doesn't have a live orchestra.
FADE OUT: Much better. Listen, can you hold off Einer and the boys
FADE OUT: till the documents on the mill are executed? Maybe a
FADE OUT: twenty four hour troll hunt, a big circle, can you do that
FADE OUT: for me, Little Brother? ...
FADE OUT: Mr. Home?
FADE OUT: Fiske, fiske. Gotta go, Jer.
FADE OUT: Ben hangs up. They speak quietly in a corner of the lobby.
FADE OUT: Sir, have you seen or heard anything from your daughter?
FADE OUT: Not since I spoke to you yesterday.
FADE OUT: She called me late last night.
FADE OUT: From where?
FADE OUT: She didn't say. She referenced seeing me in a tuxedo. I
FADE OUT: Was wearing a tux here at the hotel the night I was shot.
FADE OUT: 2.003 Revised 7-27-90, GREEN
FADE OUT: 11. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: Mr. Cooper, as I told you, Audrey's gone missing
FADE OUT: before on a semi-regular basis -
FADE OUT: Mr. Horne, let's speak frankly. Is there trouble at home?
FADE OUT: Do I detect a note of something outside the scope of
FADE OUT: professional concern?
FADE OUT: Audrey and I have struck up an acquaintance.
FADE OUT: Acquaintance. Cooper, here's the best advice you're
FADE OUT: going to get all week. Men fall under the spell of
FADE OUT: Audrey's charms like ducks in a shooting gallery. It's
FADE OUT: not pretty. If you don't want a load of buckshot in your
FADE OUT: tailfeathers, park your jalopy outside somebody else's
FADE OUT: window.
FADE OUT: If I've overstepped my bounds, I apologize. I assure
FADE OUT: you I'm here with nothing but the best intentions.
FADE OUT: That much is achingly clear and not unappreciated. I'll
FADE OUT: leave a lamp in the window and you're my first call
FADE OUT: when she comes home to roost.
FADE OUT: Thank you.
FADE OUT: No, thank you.
FADE OUT: Horne moves on. Cooper exits, biting his tongue in self-reproachment. The Asian Man puts
FADE OUT: down his newspaper and follows Cooper out of the hotel.
FADE OUT: 2.003 Revised 8-3-90, GOLDENROD
FADE OUT: 12. INT. ROOM AT ONE-EYED JACKS - DAY
FADE OUT: A 52 PICK-UP wraps a rubber tube around the arm of AUDREY HORNE who is gagged and
FADE OUT: tied into a chair. EMORY BATTIS operates a video camera focused on Audrey. A black
FADE OUT: sheet hangs behind so that it is impossible to tell where she is. BLACKIE O'REILLY tests a
FADE OUT: syringe, while watching the video feed on a monitor.
FADE OUT: That's good, Emory. She's ready for her close-up now.
FADE OUT: Battis zooms in as Blackie injects Audrey with the syringe, she jerks in her chair. The Pick-up
FADE OUT: unties the tube, Audrey fights the drug, then relaxes with a moan.
FADE OUT: Blackie moves away. A nervous Battis moves to her, speaks quietly.
FADE OUT: We should get rid of her. She knows I sent Laura up
FADE OUT: here, she knows her father owns the place -
FADE OUT: With what Ben Home will pay to have his funked-up
FADE OUT: little daughter back, I'll buy the bastard out.
FADE OUT: Look, I don't want to lose my job.
FADE OUT: Honey, if this doesn't work, you'll lose a lot more than
FADE OUT: your job.
FADE OUT: We can't do this ourselves. Ben Home is dangerous.
FADE OUT: She grabs him, holds the syringe to his throat.
FADE OUT: Listen, you spineless gasbag, you're in it, up to your
FADE OUT: shiny pate. Stop whining and do what I tell you. We'll
FADE OUT: have all the help we need.
FADE OUT: He nods. She disposes of the syringe. On the tv Audrey's eyes roll back into her head as the
FADE OUT: heroin takes over.
FADE OUT: 2.003 Revised 7-27-90, GREEN
FADE OUT: Look at her. Riding the white tiger. In a few days she
FADE OUT: won't want to come down. Just like her father did to
FADE OUT: me.
FADE OUT: 13. EXT. DOUBLE R DINER - DAY
FADE OUT: 14. INT. DOUBLE R DINER - DAY
FADE OUT: Tremayne wolfes down his meatloaf. Lucy nibbles.
FADE OUT: - of course, most of the time I keep my department
FADE OUT: running like a top, but last Christmas was such a
FADE OUT: madhouse, absolutely no time for paper work, I had to
FADE OUT: literally invent a system for memorizing customer
FADE OUT: orders using mnemonic triggers. For instance you've got
FADE OUT: someone looking for argyle socks; that would be file"s"
FADE OUT: for sock, subheading "a" for argyle. Now it gets tricky;
FADE OUT: a request for a vulcanized macintosh , for instance, is it
FADE OUT: heading "r" for raingear or "w" for waterproof? My
FADE OUT: familiarity with inventory has me leaning towards "r" -
FADE OUT: 2.003 Revised 7-27-90, GREEN
FADE OUT: 14. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: Richard happily digs into his meatloaf.
FADE OUT: Lucy, may I ask you something? Do you find it odd
FADE OUT: that I don't switch my fork when I eat, that I bring it to
FADE OUT: my mouth with my left hand?
FADE OUT: My mother called it "piling."
FADE OUT: Actually, it's not odd at all, it's the European way.
FADE OUT: He demonstrates and smiles. Pause.
FADE OUT: It's been six weeks, Dick. You said you were going to
FADE OUT: call.
FADE OUT: I know, I ... lost your number.
FADE OUT: I work for the Sheriff. You could dial 911.
FADE OUT: Lucy, I do apologize. I've been so busy, honestly, I've
FADE OUT: hardly had time to feed my cat.
FADE OUT: We went out every Thursday for three months. You made
FADE OUT: promises. You said you were going to take me to dinner
FADE OUT: at the Space Needle in Seattle. And even though you
FADE OUT: took me to Family Night at the Pancake Plantation
FADE OUT: instead, I still couldn't help but think it would mean
FADE OUT: something special, when in fact the only thing special we
FADE OUT: 2.003 Revised 7-27-90, GREEN
FADE OUT: 14. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: did that night was drink two bottles of champagne and
FADE OUT: end up on a display bed in Horne's home furnishings. I
FADE OUT: admit it was daring and that made it exciting, still I
FADE OUT: thought it would lead to more. Like a phone call.
FADE OUT: Lucy, I feel terrible that you're upset. Really I do. Let
FADE OUT: me make it up to you.
FADE OUT: For starters, I know I promised you a new dress at my
FADE OUT: 20% employee discount and I am going right back after
FADE OUT: lunch to arrange something with Ms. Bolbo in women's
FADE OUT: wear. Very special indeed.
FADE OUT: Oh yeah? How about a maternity dress?
FADE OUT: Pardon?
FADE OUT: I am pregnant, Richard. Pregnant.
FADE OUT: Preggers?
FADE OUT: 15. INT. DINER BOOTH - DAY
FADE OUT: James enters the diner and slides into a booth where MADDY FERGUSON waits. She looks
FADE OUT: different; a more attractive dress, and her hair seems softer with more of a sheen.
FADE OUT: You look great. Cool dress.
FADE OUT: It's one of Laura's. It was just hanging there in her room.
FADE OUT: Funny, I hardly remember putting, it on.
FADE OUT: It looks good on you. It looks, I don't know ... right.
FADE OUT: 2.003 Revised 7-27-90, GREEN
FADE OUT: She blushes. Looks away.
FADE OUT: Where's Donna?
FADE OUT: I don't know. She said she'd be here. Maddy, can I ask
FADE OUT: you something? Does Donna seem different to you?
FADE OUT: What do you mean?
FADE OUT: Like, doesn't her smoking and stuff bother you? Trying
FADE OUT: to act, I don't know, tough all of a sudden.
FADE OUT: James, you know her better than I do -
FADE OUT: She came to visit when I was in jail and ... I don't know.
FADE OUT: What?
FADE OUT: She acted like she wanted to do it with me thru the bars.
FADE OUT: She didn't care if anybody saw us. It was weird.
FADE OUT: Different. It wasn't like her.
FADE OUT: I don't know, Maddy. I don't know anything anymore.
FADE OUT: Sometimes I feel like I should just take off. Just get on
FADE OUT: my bike and ride.
FADE OUT: She takes his hand.
FADE OUT: Running away won't solve anything.
FADE OUT: Sometimes the only person who seems real in a way I
FADE OUT: can trust is you.
FADE OUT: Donna enters the diner. Notices James and Maddy holding hands. Moves to them. They see
FADE OUT: her and let go.
FADE OUT: 2.003 Revised 7-27-90, GREEN
FADE OUT: 15. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: Donna, where've you been? You're late.
FADE OUT: I met someone from Meals on Wheels.
FADE OUT: Did you find out anything?
FADE OUT: Someone real interesting.
FADE OUT: Those old folks must have some pretty great stories.
FADE OUT: This was a young man.
FADE OUT: Oh yeah? What's wrong with him?
FADE OUT: Hard to say. Other than that he's intelligent and
FADE OUT: charming and completely different from any one I
FADE OUT: know.
FADE OUT: What's that supposed to mean?
FADE OUT: Why don't you sit here and hold hands and try and figure
FADE OUT: it out?
FADE OUT: Donna leaves quickly. James and Maddy look at each other.
FADE OUT: 16. INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
FADE OUT: PHILLIP MICHAEL GERARD, the one armed man, is trying to sell shoes to Truman.
FADE OUT: Sitting on the table is a stack of posters of the Iong haired man. Gerard holds
FADE OUT: 2.003 Revised 7-24-90, PINK
FADE OUT: 16. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: Now these babies are perfect for heavy field work, and
FADE OUT: extremely versatile. Durable with a steel reinforced toe.
FADE OUT: They're not quite right.
FADE OUT: Gerard replaces the work boot and moves to a shiny CREPE SOLED SHOE.
FADE OUT: Now, if the department does any parading, on the
FADE OUT: Fourth, Veteran's day, these are your best bet. Add
FADE OUT: some silver trimmed laces, it's an eye-catcher.
FADE OUT: Little outside my budget, Mr. Gerard.
FADE OUT: I understand completely. You need something practical.
FADE OUT: A shoe for all seasons.
FADE OUT: Gerard places the shoe on the stack of posters of the LONG HAIRED MAN. He notices
FADE OUT: Bob's picture. Truman picks out a sensible work-boor from the rack.
FADE OUT: These are more what I had in mind.
FADE OUT: Very popular. The lovely thing about ... lovely thing
FADE OUT: about ...
FADE OUT: The shoe falls our of Gerard's hand. He weaves a bit, obviously faint.
FADE OUT: You all right?
FADE OUT: I'm sorry, sometimes I get a bit disoriented ...
FADE OUT: Can I get you something? Water?
FADE OUT: If there's a bathroom, I have a medication.
FADE OUT: Let me give you a hand.
FADE OUT: Truman helps him to the door.

FADE OUT: Hi, Shelly, be right with you.
FADE OUT: Mr. Gerard, it 's around the corner, second door on your

FADE OUT: Thank you so much.

FADE OUT: Thanks for coming down, Shelly -
FADE OUT: Sheriff, I'm just going to say this. I know I don't have
FADE OUT: to so I'm not going to say anything against Leo.
FADE OUT: We're not asking you to -
FADE OUT: He's my husband. I don't have to testify against my
FADE OUT: husband.
FADE OUT: You're not testifying, you're just giving us a statement.
FADE OUT: Doc Hayward says he's too sick, what difference does it
FADE OUT: make?
FADE OUT: Shelly, we know Leo started the fire and we know you
FADE OUT: were there
FADE OUT: 2.003 Revised 8-3-90, GOLDENROD

FADE OUT: I'm not going to say anything against him ... I love him.
FADE OUT: Okay fine, Shelly, thanks for coming in.
FADE OUT: Excuse me?
FADE OUT: You've obviously thought long and hard about this.

FADE OUT: his name?
FADE OUT: He presses Battis' nose up against the screen next to Cooper's image.
FADE OUT: Cooper.
FADE OUT: And all you have to do is give him to me.

FADE OUT: Okay, Agent Cooper. I'm ready.
FADE OUT: You are standing on a smooth green carpet of grass. Your
FADE OUT: ball is fifteen feet from hole. Beyond the green, two
FADE OUT: pristine white sandtraps and a lily filled pond yawn out
FADE OUT: towards the emerald fairway. A warm whisper of a
FADE OUT: breeze moves the flowers on the water ever so slightly.
FADE OUT: Jacoby's eyes slowly close.
FADE OUT: The hole seems to slowly drift away across the green
FADE OUT: towards the pond, carried by the summer wind. The
FADE OUT: green grows larger and larger ... the green engulfs you,
FADE OUT: enveloping you in a soft blanket of peace ... you stroke
FADE OUT: the ball, it drifts towards the hole and gently drops in
FADE OUT: its center ...
FADE OUT: Jacoby is under.
FADE OUT: Can you hear me, Dr. Jacoby?
FADE OUT: Yes.
FADE OUT: Raise your right arm.
FADE OUT: Jacoby does.

FADE OUT: Did anyone else come into the room?
FADE OUT: Yes.
FADE OUT: Can you tell me about it?
FADE OUT: The sound of tape ripping wakes me up. I see tape going
FADE OUT: around Jacques wrists. Now there's a pillow on his

FADE OUT: Sorry I haven't been out since the funeral. Things are
FADE OUT: pretty strange. So, anyway, were you sleeping with this
FADE OUT: guy Harold or what?
FADE OUT: He seems pretty nice. Kind of an oddball. I guess
FADE OUT: anybody can start to seem that way when you look close
FADE OUT: enough.
FADE OUT: We have to talk. Maybe you already know about me and
FADE OUT: James, but anyway after you died we kind of got
FADE OUT: together. This is not something I feel like I'd have to
FADE OUT: explain to you because you probably knew how we felt
FADE OUT: before we did. How could you be so smart about stuff
FADE OUT: like that and so stupid about so much else?
FADE OUT: I'm mad at you; when it was you and me and James it
FADE OUT: kind of worked. Now you're one, I love James and
FADE OUT: it's a mess. Your cousin Maddy's here and something's
FADE OUT: going on with them maybe and I think I'm going to end
FADE OUT: up losing both of you.
FADE OUT: I wanted so much to be like you. To have your strength
FADE OUT: and your courage, but look what it did, look what it
FADE OUT: did to you, Laura
FADE OUT: As much as I loved you, Laura, most of the time we
FADE OUT: were trying to solve your problems, and you know what,
FADE OUT: we still are. Not James' or mine, or Maddy's, yours.
FADE OUT: You're dead, but your problems are still hanging around.
FADE OUT: It's like they didn't bury you deep enough.

FADE OUT: anything. God I hate her.
FADE OUT: Who, James?
FADE OUT: James is pulling himself apart. He tries to talk but nothing comes out. She holds him.
FADE OUT: God, you're on fire.
FADE OUT: James pulls back a little. Their faces are close. They kiss. Gently at first and then with

FADE OUT: You care because you care for him. Don't you?
FADE OUT: I wish I didn't. I just want it to stop.
FADE OUT: First, you have to stop.
FADE OUT: What was it she always used to say to you? "Donna
