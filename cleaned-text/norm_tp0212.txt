REVISED: Pardon?
REVISED: #2.012.1
REVISED: 1. CONTINUED:
REVISED: The first thing you ask is "What's on the top floor?"

REVISED: bridal nightgown, rushes by him. Bobby smiles helplessly slowly closing the door on the strap of

REVISED: #2.012.1
REVISED: 3. CONTINUED:

REVISED: Very good. Which would you like to see first?
REVISED: Cooper smiles. Takes a coin from his pocket. Flips it onto the table. It rolls and stops on a
REVISED: picture of yet another property.
REVISED: What is this?
REVISED: I thought I'd take that out. This property is called
REVISED: "Dead Dog Farm." And it's worse than it sounds.
REVISED: "Dead Dog Farm." What is it?
REVISED: A puzzle. No one ever stays there long Dreamer after
REVISED: dreamer has worked that patch of land.
REVISED: "A parcel of vain strivings tied by a chance bond
REVISED: together."
REVISED: Littlehorse smiles at Cooper.

REVISED: Harry?
REVISED: Cooper, this is Colonel Reilly. He's heading up the Air

REVISED: No visual contact?
REVISED: Look, Colonel, Garland Briggs is a good friend of mine
REVISED: and this has us more than a little spooked. I really wish
REVISED: you'd just level with us.
REVISED: #2.012.1
REVISED: 4. CONTINUED:
REVISED: Can you clarify that?
REVISED: We know about your monitors and the messages you
REVISED: received from deep space that pertain to me.
REVISED: You may know something but you'd best get your facts
REVISED: straight: our "monitors" are pointed at deep space, but
REVISED: the messages we intercepted that Briggs showed you
REVISED: were sent from right here in these woods. Where they
REVISED: were being sent to is another question.
REVISED: He points to the map again, near the disappearance site. A stunned moment as this sinks in.
REVISED: Colonel, does this have anything to do with a place
REVISED: called the White Lodge?
REVISED: That's classified.
REVISED: Look, Colonel, we'd like to help you but you're not
REVISED: making it any easier.
REVISED: Garland Briggs is the best pilot I've ever known. He was
REVISED: born with hardware most of us only dream of having.
REVISED: He's been walking point on this operation for three years,
REVISED: carrying a full pack. I'll tell you this: his disappearance

REVISED: #2.012.1
REVISED: 5. CONTINUED:
REVISED: As I was about to tell your friends, the number one thing
REVISED: to know about Nicky is that throughout his brief life he
REVISED: has been confused, and perhaps traumatized, by a
REVISED: persistent random misfortune.
REVISED: Looks like he's bounced around quite a bit.
REVISED: The poor child.
REVISED: Yes. An orphan, you know.
REVISED: Really? What happened? Did his parents die?
REVISED: Nicely deduced, Andrew. Persistent random
REVISED: misfortune.
REVISED: They were killed.
REVISED: How were they killed, Miss Swain?
REVISED: Mysterious circumstances. I'm afraid the orphanage has
REVISED: never provided us with that information.
REVISED: Sheriff Truman hustles out of his office to announce ...

REVISED: Can I help you?
REVISED: I'm heading up the local serf rebellion. Wondering if

REVISED: Malcolm. Malcom Sloan.
REVISED: As in "Brother to Evelyn." I'm Mr. Marsh's driver ... as
REVISED: in "Bring the car around, James."
REVISED: I spend a lot of time waiting at airports, happily
REVISED: basking in the glow of cocktail lounge flourescents.
REVISED: How badly did she damage the Jag?
REVISED: It's repairable.
REVISED: That's the nice thing about things. When she and Jeffrey
REVISED: fell In love, he gave her a new life. I got a nice uniform
REVISED: and the keys to the liquor cabinet.
REVISED: Hope I don't sound ungrateful. Compared to the life I
REVISED: was living wanton dissipation is a step up - and Evelyn,
REVISED: well, she's learned a lot herself. Defensive postures.
REVISED: Masking bruises. Vicious cycles.
REVISED: What are you talking about?
REVISED: I'm sorry, am I being obscure? Once a fortnight, Jeffrey
REVISED: pounds her mercilessly and she tries to get even by
REVISED: breaking one of his things, which perpetuates the cycle.
REVISED: She's your sister, why don't you stop him?
REVISED: Sonny boy, nobody stops Mr. Marsh. That's the golden
REVISED: rule around here. Jot it down and put it under your
REVISED: pillow.

REVISED: The corpse of DOUGIE MILFORD lies in the bed. A frozen grin is plastered on his face as
REVISED: DOC HAYWARD finishes a cursory exam and pulls a sheet over his head.
REVISED: Looks like a heart attack.
REVISED: Andy and Truman stand by. Dougie's dead hand clasping an open book falls out from below
REVISED: the sheet. Andy leans over and reads.
REVISED: "Once stimulated the female will respond in such a way
REVISED: that the skin around the ..." oh my God ...
REVISED: Guess Dougie went out with his boots on.
REVISED: "My Secret Life."
REVISED: I'll say ...
REVISED: "Kama Sutra," "Collected Poems of Byron," "Hookers
REVISED: and Handmaidens."
REVISED: Andy discovers an ornate, purple wooden BOX on a luggage stand.
REVISED: Sheriff? Look at this.
REVISED: The three gather around it and slowly, silently take out it's contents: two red clown noses,
REVISED: monk's robe and cowl, large rubber bands, lotions, an eggbeater, and, finally, a lifelike mask
REVISED: that bears an eerie resemblance to Gary Crosby. They stand there in awe of this discovery
REVISED: until their focus is broken by shouting at the door. Mayor DWAYNE MILFORD, Dougie's
REVISED: brother, walks into the room swelling with emotion.
REVISED: What a falling off was here ... Dougie. Lord, I hate to
REVISED: say I told you so.
REVISED: Here it is, Sheriff. The murder weapon. She might as
REVISED: well have blown his brains out with a rifle. He never
REVISED: could say no to a woman ... the old fool.
REVISED: He begins to weep. Truman gestures to Andy who gently leads the Mayor to the door. Andy
REVISED: opens the door and hands the mayor over to two DEPUTIES standing outside.

REVISED: As the deputies take Dwayne out he spots Lana, giving her statement to Hawk.
REVISED: You sexual Howitzer. You'll burn in hell for this.
REVISED: Take it easy, Mr. Milford -
REVISED: I'm going to shout to wake the dead! She murdered my
REVISED: brother, she's a witch!
REVISED: He makes a pathetic attempt to get to her, forcing the deputies to lead him away. Lana begins
REVISED: to weep. Hawk tries to comfort her.
REVISED: He's right. I'm cursed.
REVISED: Don't be silly.
REVISED: No, it's true. It started in high school. Prom night.
REVISED: My date went to kiss me ... it was his first day with
REVISED: braces. They gleamed in the moonlight ... and his jaw
REVISED: locked open.
REVISED: We ended up in the emergency room. The doctors had
REVISED: to break his jaw in three places to get it to shut. It's
REVISED: gotten worse ever since.
REVISED: A curse needs a cure. I know a bit about these things.
REVISED: Are you the sheriff?
REVISED: Hawk idly leans his chair back against the door to Dougie's room. Puffing up.
REVISED: Let's just say that when something big goes down, I just
REVISED: happen to be the man who's -
REVISED: Andy opens the door behind him. Hawk goes over. On his back he looks up to see Andy
REVISED: beaming stupidly at the bride, caught in her spell, as he steps on Hawk's hand.

FADE OUT: Wrestling coach, BUCK WINGATE, lectures his assembled squad who stare at NADINE
FADE OUT: HURLEY and MIKE NELSON standing next to one another in wrestling gear on the mat.
FADE OUT: Boys, there's a story about a great football coach whose
FADE OUT: name escapes me at the time who was dead set against
FADE OUT: having black players on his team until the day they
FADE OUT: brought him the most fantastic black halfback anyone
FADE OUT: had ever seen. When what's his name watched him run
FADE OUT: fifty yards and no one laid a hand on him, he shouted,
FADE OUT: "Look at that Indian go!"
FADE OUT: That coach accepted that athlete's desire to compete.
FADE OUT: Today that same story applies to this woman's ... young
FADE OUT: girl's right to compete as well. In addition to which,
FADE OUT: it's her moral and constitutional right.

FADE OUT: Ready to wrestle at the sound of the whistle ...
FADE OUT: Wingate blows his whistle. Nadine and Mike circle each other looking for the take down.
FADE OUT: Hesitatingly, Mike makes a move for Nadine's legs, she takes him by the shoulders and lifts
FADE OUT: him above her head. She carries on a conversation only she and Mike can hear.
FADE OUT: Hi, Mike.
FADE OUT: What are you doing?
FADE OUT: Mike looks down at Nadine helplessly. She lowers him to the mat. Whispering to him.
FADE OUT: Isn't it fun we get to be so close in public?

FADE OUT: Want to go do something tonight? I don't have a curfew
FADE OUT: ... hint, hint.
FADE OUT: The rest of the team is yelling: "Pin ... Pin ..." Mike lets out a groan. To Nadine it is an
FADE OUT: answer she can't hear. She flips him over to his back.
FADE OUT: What'd you say Mike?
FADE OUT: Yes. Yes.
FADE OUT: He's pinned. Coach Wingate holds up Nadine's arm.
FADE OUT: Welcome aboard, Nadine Too bad you're a senior.
FADE OUT: Nadine beams at Mike who returns her look with terror.
FADE OUT: 10. EXT. DEAD DOG
FADE OUT: Cooper and Littlehorse stare at the house on Dead Dog Farms. An abandoned building on a
FADE OUT: derelict farm. FADED SHUTTERS guard the window.
FADE OUT: Still standing almost by force of habit.
FADE OUT: Habit can provide a strong foundation. Why is it called
FADE OUT: Dead Dog Farm?
FADE OUT: An old legend. Of all the people in the world the worst
FADE OUT: and the best are drawn to a dead dog.
FADE OUT: Most turn away; those with the purest of hearts feel its
FADE OUT: pain. Somewhere in between the rest of us struggle.
FADE OUT: Cooper nods, walks up the muddy driveway. He stops when he sees TIRE TRACKS.
FADE OUT: Have you showed the property to anyone else recently?

FADE OUT: Three cars. One a jeep, one a four-wheeler. Third's a
FADE OUT: domestic sedan ... boot prints.
FADE OUT: Cooper follows them towards the door. Irene follows.
FADE OUT: 11. INT. KITCHEN, DEAD DOG FARM HOUSE - DAY
FADE OUT: Littlehorse follows Cooper into the room. The place is a mess with the exception of a table
FADE OUT: and chairs set upright. Cooper sits in a chair and then sits in one opposite it, studies the angles.
FADE OUT: Examines some ashes on the floor.
FADE OUT: What are you seeing?
FADE OUT: There's been a meeting here. Within the last few hours.
FADE OUT: He hunts around for something else. Sticks his hand into the drain in the sink.
FADE OUT: They forgot there was no running water.
FADE OUT: (brings out a bit of fine white powder; holds it
FADE OUT: to the realtor's nose)
FADE OUT: Smell anything?
FADE OUT: No.
FADE OUT: Baby laxative.
FADE OUT: Cooper lies on the floor under the table with his head flat against it. A bird's eye view. He
FADE OUT: slides his head along the floor. Finds what he is looking for. He licks his finger, runs it along
FADE OUT: the floor and brings it up covered with white powder. He shows it to Littlehorse.
FADE OUT: More white powder.
FADE OUT: Cooper holds the hand with the powder from the drain in the sink up to Littlehorse.

FADE OUT: 12. EXT. ROAD IN THE WOODS - DAY
FADE OUT: Tremayne's car is pulled to the side of the road with a flat tire. Tremayne has managed to get
FADE OUT: the car up on a jack. The lug nuts, the spare wheel, and the flat tire lie before him. He's trying
FADE OUT: to read the jack's directions, leaning against the hood.
FADE OUT: I don't understand this at all. I just had the car checked
FADE OUT: at the Gas Farm and they assured me everything was in
FADE OUT: perfect working order. This all seems so ... technical.
FADE OUT: (his concentration is broken by a piercing blast
FADE OUT: from the car's horn)
FADE OUT: Please, Nicky, Uncle Dick is trying to read -
FADE OUT: (drowned out by more blasts from the horn.
FADE OUT: Tremayne snaps)
FADE OUT: Get out of the car, Nicholas. Nicholas, get out of the
FADE OUT: car! Right now, out of the car! Out of the CAR!
FADE OUT: The horn stops. Pause. Nicky exits the car and moves sheepishly to Tremayne.
FADE OUT: Are you mad at me, Uncle Dick?
FADE OUT: No, no, of course, not. Why should I be mad?
FADE OUT: I scared you, didn't I? You jumped around like a do- do
FADE OUT: bird.
FADE OUT: He laughs. Tremayne goes back to work. Nicky wanders away.
QUICK DISSOLVE: 
QUICK DISSOLVE: Tremayne brings the tire up to put it on the axle, he leans into the wheel well. As he does this
QUICK DISSOLVE: the car slowly begins to rock off it's jack ... about to come down on Tremayne's neck and
QUICK DISSOLVE: shoulder. Tremayne realizes this just in time and pulls away. His glove is caught in the wheel
QUICK DISSOLVE: well. He watches as the fingers of the glove are torn off and crushed. A very close call. From
QUICK DISSOLVE: behind him, Nicky appears crying his eyes out.
QUICK DISSOLVE: Uncle Dick, Uncle Dick.
QUICK DISSOLVE: He rushes into Tremayne's embrace.
QUICK DISSOLVE: I'm alright. Don't worry.
QUICK DISSOLVE: What? What is it, Little Nicky?
QUICK DISSOLVE: #2.012.1
QUICK DISSOLVE: 12. CONTINUED:
QUICK DISSOLVE: What if you died? You're aren't going to die, are you?
QUICK DISSOLVE: Of course not, Nicky. Don't be silly.
QUICK DISSOLVE: As he comforts Nicky, Tremayne studies the overturned jack and the car sitting on absolutely
QUICK DISSOLVE: flat land. His smile fades.

QUICK DISSOLVE: James works below the Dusenberg on a sled. EVELYN MARSH moves into the room. James
QUICK DISSOLVE: sneaks a look as she walks towards the car; she wears an opened blouse and cut off jeans. She
QUICK DISSOLVE: carries a six pack of beer and limes. James slides the sled out.
QUICK DISSOLVE: Coffe break?
QUICK DISSOLVE: Sounds great. Give me just a second.
QUICK DISSOLVE: James slides back under for a moment. Evelyn drifts to the window, stands in the sunlight.
QUICK DISSOLVE: It's so hot today. Feels like Indian summer. Can you
QUICK DISSOLVE: have Indian summer in the spring?
QUICK DISSOLVE: I don't know why not.
QUICK DISSOLVE: She turns back, as James comes out from under the car.
QUICK DISSOLVE: I love the sun. Feels like it could just burn away all your
QUICK DISSOLVE: troubles. Wouldn't that be nice?
QUICK DISSOLVE: I guess.
QUICK DISSOLVE: You've got troubles, don't you? Maybe someday we
QUICK DISSOLVE: should tell each other all our sad stories.
QUICK DISSOLVE: That could take a while.
QUICK DISSOLVE: #2.012.1
QUICK DISSOLVE: 13. CONTINUED:
QUICK DISSOLVE: You must be absolutely fried working under there.
QUICK DISSOLVE: Not so bad. Here, look.
QUICK DISSOLVE: He enthusiastically slides behind the wheel of the car. Turns the key and the car's engine
QUICK DISSOLVE: ignites and purrs.
QUICK DISSOLVE: Engine's fine. Think the axle'll be okay, too.
QUICK DISSOLVE: How'd you get so good at this?
QUICK DISSOLVE: My Uncle Ed. You think I'm good you should see him.
QUICK DISSOLVE: He can fix anything.
QUICK DISSOLVE: Anything?
QUICK DISSOLVE: Evelyn is lost in a sad thought. James snuggles with her gloom.
QUICK DISSOLVE: Met your brother today. We were talking. About your
QUICK DISSOLVE: situation and everything -
QUICK DISSOLVE: Mind your own business, James.
QUICK DISSOLVE: A guy like me, I look at you, you've got this house, all
QUICK DISSOLVE: these things, you're young and beautiful, maybe I'm
QUICK DISSOLVE: dumb but I don't get it. Why are you so sad?
QUICK DISSOLVE: Am I so easy to read?
QUICK DISSOLVE: You afraid of something? Afraid of your husband?
QUICK DISSOLVE: Are you?
QUICK DISSOLVE: Do you know what it's like ... to be so alone and so
QUICK DISSOLVE: scared that all you can think about is the wrong thing?

QUICK DISSOLVE: 13. CONTINUED:
QUICK DISSOLVE: I know what it's like to be alone.
QUICK DISSOLVE: James. James. You're so sweet.
QUICK DISSOLVE: He wipes the tears off her cheek. They stare at each other for a moment. Then slowly they kiss.
QUICK DISSOLVE: ... I feel like he's stealing my life away.
QUICK DISSOLVE: Why don't you leave?
QUICK DISSOLVE: It's ... complicated.
QUICK DISSOLVE: Evelyn clings to James. They kiss again. The tender kiss melts into passion. Only to be
QUICK DISSOLVE: interrupted by the a CAR HORN.
QUICK DISSOLVE: My God, it's him.
QUICK DISSOLVE: A car pulls up into the courtyard. She pulls away from him.
QUICK DISSOLVE: I've got to go. Don't worry about it. It's not as bad as
QUICK DISSOLVE: all that. Please don't worry about me. Promise.
QUICK DISSOLVE: JEFFREY'S VOICE
QUICK DISSOLVE: Evelyn, where are you, dear?
QUICK DISSOLVE: Evelyn kisses him again, lightly, then hurries to the door. James goes to the window. He

FADE OUT: looks at it, puzzled. Ben steps into the room , unshaven, wearing a grey civil war tunic, carrying
FADE OUT: a large Confederate flag. Bobby leaps to his feet, brimming with newfound confidence.
FADE OUT: Hey, Ben, how's it going?
FADE OUT: Why is God punishing me?
FADE OUT: I followed Hank. Got the pictures. Just like you
FADE OUT: wanted. Ben, what is this you're doing here?
FADE OUT: Gettysburg. Day One. The South is winning.

FADE OUT: He's meeting guys I've never seen before, and these boys
FADE OUT: ain't exactly from the Rotary, if you know what I mean.
FADE OUT: Ben holds up a hand to stop his babbling. Bobby stops immediately. Ben peers long and hard
FADE OUT: at the photographs. A beat. Ben smiles.
FADE OUT: Bobby. I like you. How much am I paying, you,
FADE OUT: We haven't actually discussed -
FADE OUT: Ben reaches into his wallet, extracts a new bill. Hands it to Bobby.
FADE OUT: Consider this your first raise. Come back tomorrow
FADE OUT: and we'll discuss a full-time position.
FADE OUT: Thank you, Ben. I won't let you down.

FADE OUT: The trick is to open the damn bottle before the vintage
FADE OUT: expires.
FADE OUT: Pete and CATHERINE MARTELL in the Blue Pine dining room. A celebratory meal

FADE OUT: Champagne bubbles forth, spilling upon the table. Catherine holds out her goblet.
FADE OUT: Nectar of the Gods, Catherine. It's the bubbles.
FADE OUT: Pete manages to move some of the froth inside her glass, then his own. Pete smiles, holds his
FADE OUT: glass into the air. He means to propose a roast. Catherine grudgingly follows suit.
FADE OUT: "Wine comes in at the mouth, love comes in at the eye; I
FADE OUT: hold my glass to my lips, I look at you and sigh ..."
FADE OUT: Thank you, Pete. That's very lyrical.
FADE OUT: It's Yeats. He's a poet.
FADE OUT: Yes, I know.
FADE OUT: The only other toast I know is a limerick. It didn't
FADE OUT: seem appropriate.
FADE OUT: Thank you, Pete. Really. I'm touched.
FADE OUT: "There once was a lady from Galway ..."
FADE OUT: JOSIE!!
FADE OUT: JOSIE PACKARD appears from the kitchen. She's wearing a serving apron.
FADE OUT: Josie, I want you to know that even though your station in

FADE OUT: watches Josie exit, then, quietly:
FADE OUT: Catherine? You think maybe you're being a little hard on
FADE OUT: her? I mean she's still part of the family and all.
FADE OUT: Peter, for your information, Josie had a hand in
FADE OUT: Andrew's death and did everything in her power to
FADE OUT: destroy me. She's lucky she's not swinging from a tree.
FADE OUT: I don't believe it. Not the Josie I know ...
FADE OUT: Oh, Pete. If gullibility was an aphrodisiac, you'd be a
FADE OUT: Harem King.
FADE OUT: Pete takes the latter as a compliment. Or maybe he's being sarcastic. It's hard to tell.
FADE OUT: You're too kind.
FADE OUT: Exasperated, Catherine finishes her second glass. Pours a third. She looks at Pete, considers
FADE OUT: their life together. And raises her own hand into the air, getting a little tipsy.
FADE OUT: I'd like to propose a toast.
FADE OUT: Pete hefts a glass of milk.

FADE OUT: START CLOSE on an advertisement in a newspaper personals column. Cooper's answer to
FADE OUT: Windom Earle's opening move. ANOTHER ANGLE reveals Cooper seated on his bed,
FADE OUT: holding the newspaper in one hand, his small tape recorder in the other.
FADE OUT: Diane, I am holding in my hand a nationally distributed
FADE OUT: newspaper. Plenty of color pictures. My opening move
FADE OUT: responding to Earle's opening move was printed per my
FADE OUT: instructions in the Personals column ... but I've already
FADE OUT: received his response to this ... yesterday. He
FADE OUT: anticipated my opening move perfectly. I wonder where
FADE OUT: he is. I wonder what he's planning.
FADE OUT: In the meantime, I have spent my first full day without
FADE OUT: badge and gun the best way I know how: occupying both
FADE OUT: body and spirit. Real estate, Diane what the local agent
FADE OUT: charitably describes as a Fixer-Upper. Nonetheless, it's
FADE OUT: the sort of where a man might build a home, raise
FADE OUT: a family, I which in spite of my past, I still hope to do
FADE OUT: both someday. However, as is so often the case, even this
FADE OUT: bucolic hideway is filled with secrets. Secrets that
FADE OUT: may be connected to my troubles with the Bureau. Not
FADE OUT: to mention the cocaine found in my automobile.
FADE OUT: Agent Hardy's deliberations will soon be completed. If
FADE OUT: I can't adequately defend myself there is the very real
FADE OUT: possibility of imprisonment. Other innocent men have
FADE OUT: served there, apparently with no great detriment to the
FADE OUT: development of their character. If I must go, I hope I
FADE OUT: can uphold the tradition established by Doestoyevsky,
FADE OUT: Solzhinytsen and many other great Russian authors.
FADE OUT: Cooper pauses, sad, uncertain. He pulls the Bookhouse Boy patch out of his pocket, just holds
FADE OUT: it for a moment. As if to consider his future. Suddenly: a knock at the door. Cooper turns off
FADE OUT: the recorder, steps carefully to answer it. Out of habit, he reaches toward his shoulder holster,
FADE OUT: reacts. He has no gun to protect himself. A beat. More knocking. Cooper answers and reveals
FADE OUT: Audrey Horne holding the manila envelope last seen in her father's office.

FADE OUT: Audrey.
FADE OUT: Hello, Agent Cooper.
FADE OUT: This is for you. I stole it.
FADE OUT: Then I suggest you give it back.
FADE OUT: Not until you look inside.
FADE OUT: What will I find there?
FADE OUT: Pictures my father paid for.
FADE OUT: A beat. Cooper takes the envelope, steps from the door. Audrey follows. Cooper removes the
FADE OUT: photographs, produces a magnifying glass. And examines them: black and white snaps taken
FADE OUT: at Dead Dog Farm. The weatherbeaten house, its distinctive shutters, visible in the
FADE OUT: background. But, more importantly: Hank Jennings meeting with several men: Ernie Niles,
FADE OUT: Jean Renault and the Mountie, Preston King.
FADE OUT: I did good, didn't I?
FADE OUT: You did better than good. You may have saved my life.
FADE OUT: Good. So now we're even.
FADE OUT: Another knock at the door.
FADE OUT: Excuse me.
FADE OUT: Cooper steps to the door, opens it a second time.
FADE OUT: Denise.
FADE OUT: DENISE BRYSON steps into the room. Audrey reacts, disappointment turns to jealousy.
FADE OUT: #2.012.1
FADE OUT: 23. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: Sorry. I didn't know I was interrupting -
FADE OUT: Business, Audrey. This is Agent Denise Bryson, Drug
FADE OUT: Enforcement Agency. Denise, I'd like you to meet a
FADE OUT: very good friend of mine. Audrey Horne.
FADE OUT: They have girl agents?
FADE OUT: More or less.
FADE OUT: Audrey, would you excuse, us please? Agency business.
FADE OUT: I thought you were grounded.
FADE OUT: Not for long. Goodnight. Thank you again.
FADE OUT: Goodnight. You're welcome.
FADE OUT: Audrey pauses. Then, quite suddenly, she raises up and kisses Cooper on the mouth. Audrey
FADE OUT: takes a proud look at Denise, and steps out the door. A beat. Both ignoring the stolen kiss.
FADE OUT: Cooper hands the photographs to Denise.
FADE OUT: I spent the late morning looking at an abandoned
FADE OUT: property on the outskirts of town. Tire tracks indicated
FADE OUT: recent activity. In the kitchen, I found traces of cocaine
FADE OUT: and the baby laxitive used to step it out. These pictures
FADE OUT: place Jean Renault, Hank Jennings, Norma Jennings'
FADE OUT: father-in-law, and Preston King, Mountie, at the same
FADE OUT: scene earlier today.
FADE OUT: I wonder who brought the coffee cake.
FADE OUT: Cooper reaches into his bag, reveals the envelope of cocaine he took from the farm.
FADE OUT: Check this sample I took from the farmhouse with the

FADE OUT: it's a match. I was set up and I can prove it.
FADE OUT: Denise takes the envelope.
FADE OUT: Let's talk about something more important: exactly how
FADE OUT: old is that girl?
FADE OUT: I would have assumed you were no longer interested in
FADE OUT: women.
FADE OUT: Hey, I may be wearing a dress but I still put my panties

FADE OUT: Yes?
