REVISED: 1. INT. SHERIFF TRUMAN'S OFFICE - NIGHT
REVISED: Close on the fibers of a fabric tape. We slowly pull back revealing that it is the tape covering
REVISED: the mouth of the DEAD MAN. A surgical gloved hand reaches into the frame and slowly
REVISED: pulls the tape off the mouth, inside the mouth attached to the tape is a black chess piece - a
REVISED: pawn. We pull back to DOC HAYWARD, AGENT COOPER.
REVISED: Good Lord.
REVISED: Cooper reaches in, removes the chess piece and examines it: it's a match to the pieces on the
REVISED: chess board set up on the table. HARRY enters the room.
REVISED: No one saw a thing. The blackout and fire drew
REVISED: everyone out of the building.
REVISED: Andy, we'll need this dusted for prints ...
REVISED: Cooper drops the chess piece in a bag and hands it to ANDY standing inside the door with his
REVISED: eyes closed so he won't see the body and cry. He reaches out for the bag, misses it. Truman
REVISED: puts it in Andy's hand. Andy turns to leave and walks into to the wall with a thud. Andy peeks,
REVISED: adjusts his trajectory and makes it.
REVISED: How long has he been dead, Doc?
REVISED: Hard to tell; we'll need an autopsy.
REVISED: Doc, open the victim's shirt. I believe you will find an
REVISED: incision, a stab wound one inch beneath the sternum,
REVISED: penetrating upwards, severing the aorta.
REVISED: Hayward and Truman exchange a look then Doc opens the shirt. Cooper was right.
REVISED: You've seen this before.
REVISED: No blood stains.
REVISED: 2.014 Revised 11-28-90, YELLOW
REVISED: 1. CONTINUED:
REVISED: Cooper picks a pine needle up off the floor. Then walks to the middle windowsill, examines
REVISED: with magnifier. HAWK comes in the door.
REVISED: Hawk, footprints?
REVISED: Two sets, same boots; one coming, one leaving. Heavier
REVISED: impressions on the way down.
REVISED: Carrying the body.
REVISED: We should get molds made of those before it rains.
REVISED: He'll have been wearing the wrong size shoe, untraceable
REVISED: and already destroyed.
REVISED: I followed them to the granite stream up the ridge, lost
REVISED: them on the rocks.
REVISED: He knows how to mask a trail ... any cars stolen in town
REVISED: recently?
REVISED: There was one a couple of days ago, from the Cash and
REVISED: Carry on Sparkwood. No witnesses. Cooper, you're
REVISED: sure Windom Earle's behind this?
REVISED: Cooper nods, steps to the window, looks into the darkness.
REVISED: A short time ago, a vagrant ... our victim was befriended
REVISED: and offered a lift. He was given some cheap wine and a
REVISED: cigarette. The victim was then driven to a location up
REVISED: behind the ridge, you'll find the car still up there. He
REVISED: was stabbed, once, managed to run at least fifty yards,
REVISED: cutting his hands and face on brush before collapsing.
REVISED: Earle engineered the explosion that caused the power
REVISED: failure, created the diversionary fire that drew everyone
REVISED: outside the station, then brought the body in through this
REVISED: window.
REVISED: Windom Earle has been in this room. I can still feel his
REVISED: presence. There aren't going to be any fingerprints in
REVISED: 2.014 Revised 11-27-90, GREEN
REVISED: 1. CONTINUED:
REVISED: here, Harry. No slip-ups, oversights, no mistakes.
REVISED: Everything he does has its own rationale, precision and
REVISED: intelligence. Windom Earle is a genius. And he's taken
REVISED: his first pawn. In a very sick game.
REVISED: 2. EXT. GREAT NORTHERN - NIGHT
REVISED: 3. INT. GREAT NORTHERN LOBBY - NIGHT
REVISED: AUDREY and BOBBY sit at a small round table. The power is out. Candlelight illuminates
REVISED: the scene. They have drinks between them. Plus a bucket of ice. Audrey drops a few cubes
REVISED: into Bobby's glass and a few into hers.
REVISED: Listen carefully, Bobby Briggs, here's what we're gonna
REVISED: do. If I have learned anything from my father before he
REVISED: flipped his wig it's that a business relationship is a
REVISED: sacred pact, equaled only by the closest of personal
REVISED: relationships ... where nothing is held back.
REVISED: Right.
REVISED: Do you want to get rich, Bobby?
REVISED: Immediately.
REVISED: Maybe I can help. This is the last of the ice cubes till the
REVISED: power comes back on.
REVISED: She reaches over and picks an ice cube out of Bobby's drink.
REVISED: Now, pretend this is my father.
REVISED: She closes her hand around it.
REVISED: An ice cube?
REVISED: 2.014 Revised 11-27-90, GREEN
REVISED: 3. CONTINUED:
REVISED: Right. And our job now is to help my father find his
REVISED: way back from Limbo-Land so he doesn't melt away and
REVISED: leave me with a handful of nothing.
REVISED: She reopens her hand, the cube is melted.
REVISED: We wouldn't want that to happen, would we?
REVISED: No.
REVISED: From now on Bobby I'm the one you suck up to.
REVISED: She licks up the melted water.
REVISED: What about Shelly?
REVISED: What about Shelly?
REVISED: Bobby's eyes grow stalks. He finishes his drink.
REVISED: 4. EXT. LEO JOHNSON'S HOUSE - NIGHT
REVISED: Establish, not a light on.
REVISED: 5. INT. LEO JOHNSON'S HOUSE - NIGHT
REVISED: POV, moving frantically through the darkened kitchen into the living room and to the door.
REVISED: We pull back, SHELLY desperately tries to open the door but it's been locked from the out
REVISED: side.
REVISED: No!
REVISED: She looks back into the kitchen, it's pitch black, she can't see a thing.
REVISED: 2.014 Revised 11-26-90, PINK
REVISED: 5. CONTINUED:
REVISED: Oh, God ... please no.
REVISED: The sound of a creaking wheel on the wheelchair is heard.
REVISED: Leo?
REVISED: Out of the darkness comes Leo's wheelchair directly toward her, it knocks over a lamp, comes
REVISED: closer and closer. She jumps out of the way as it crashes into the door. Shelly starts for a
REVISED: window, something flies through the air and lands at her feet. She freezes; a bar of soap in a
REVISED: sock lays on the floor. A guttural laugh rises out of the darkness.
REVISED: Don't do this, Leo.
REVISED: From the darkness comes.
REVISED: Le...O. Le...O.
REVISED: The refrigerator door swings open. The light from inside illuminates a grinning crazed-
REVISED: looking LEO.
REVISED: F-u-n-s o-v-e-r.
REVISED: Leo laughs again. The refrigerator slowly closes. From the darkness comes the sound of a foot
REVISED: dragging across the floor. Shelly makes a break for it, out of the darkness Leo's hand grabs
REVISED: Shelly by the neck, pulls her close to him.
REVISED: Le-o go-od.
REVISED: He smiles, then throws her across the table, sending her and everything on the table crashing
REVISED: into the corner.
REVISED: Fu-n.
REVISED: Leo shuffles toward Shelly, his left leg and arm not quite up to snuff. He stops, reaches up and
REVISED: turns on the radio.
REVISED: Le-o like mu-sic.
REVISED: 2.014
REVISED: 5. CONTINUED:
REVISED: Shelly picks up a toaster and hurls it at him, bouncing it off his chest. Leo looks at the
REVISED: toaster, then down at his chest.
REVISED: Ow.
REVISED: Shelly tries to run again, no luck, Leo has her, grabs her by the throat. He starts to spin her
REVISED: around, his grip tightening on her throat as he does. Shelly tries to pull away, but even with
REVISED: only one good arm Leo it too much, desperately close to passing out she strikes, gouging at his
REVISED: eyes. Leo erupts in a rage, throws her into the living room where she crashes against the wall.
REVISED: Leo then flips the kitchen table over and lets out an animal like howl.
REVISED: 6. EXT. LEO'S BACK DOOR - NIGHT
REVISED: Bobby steps up to the door, still buzzed from the evening with Audrey, takes in a deep breath
REVISED: of the fresh night air, and hears Leo's howl.
REVISED: 7. INT. LEO'S
REVISED: A bruised and battered Shelly cowers in the corner as Leo slowly approaches, a silent monster.
REVISED: 8. EXT. LEO'S - NIGHT
REVISED: Bobby tries the door but it won't open, then bangs on it.
REVISED: Shelly? Shelly?
REVISED: Bobby walks over to the window and looks in, rubs on the glass to get a clearer view. Shelly
REVISED: pulls herself up to the glass, bruised and crying.
REVISED: Shelly?
REVISED: We hear the howl again, then Leo's fist comes crashing through the window. Bobby tumbles
REVISED: away from the window in terror.
REVISED: Leo?
REVISED: From inside we hear Shelly scream, as Leo grabs her.
REVISED: 2.014
REVISED: 8. CONTINUED:
REVISED: Bobby!
REVISED: Bobby races to the door and tries to break it in, no luck.
REVISED: 9. INT. LEO'S - NIGHT
REVISED: Leo has Shelly by the hair and is dragging her toward the living room. Off screen we can hear
REVISED: the frantic pounding and shouts of Bobby. They reach the kitchen and Leo drops her onto the
REVISED: floor. Stands over her for a long moment.
REVISED: Good-bye wi-fe.
REVISED: He raises up his big boot above her face, a tear falls from his eye, he's going to crush her.
REVISED: Shelly screams. Bobby bursts through the back door and is on Leo before he can react. They
REVISED: tumble to the floor, for a moment Bobby has an advantage.
REVISED: You bastard!
REVISED: Leo suddenly reaches up with tremendous strength, grabs a surprised Bobby by the neck and
REVISED: flips him on to the floor, then is on top of him. Leo smiles.
REVISED: Hell-o Bob-by.
REVISED: Leo begins to laugh, then tightens his grip. Bobby gags, the throat is beginning to go. Bobby
REVISED: manages to reach into a pocket and pull out his lighter, flicks it on. Leo stares at the flame,
REVISED: transfixed. Bobby moves the lighter close to Leo's face. Leo smiles, transfixed. Bobby then
REVISED: adjusts the flame and it shoots up into Leo's face, he erupts in a scream and covers his face with
REVISED: his hands.
REVISED: Ahhhh!
REVISED: He stands, bounces off the walls knocking things down, then runs out into the darkness. Bobby
REVISED: crawls over to Shelly, takes her in his arms, a tear falls from her eyes.
REVISED: Bobby.
REVISED: It's okay now, he's gone.
REVISED: 2.014
REVISED: 9. CONTINUED:
REVISED: Don't leave me again, please, Bobby, please.
REVISED: I'm here, baby, everything's all right now.
REVISED: From out of the darkness we hear another one of Leo's howls. We move in on the open door,
REVISED: creaking on it's hinges.

FADE OUT: A flashbulb whites out the scene. When it clears, we are on a white sheet being draped over the
FADE OUT: dead man laying on a stretcher. We pull back to Cooper looking tired from a long night of
FADE OUT: forensic work which is winding up.
FADE OUT: No prints, no fibers. You were right. If it's Earle, he
FADE OUT: didn't miss a beat.
FADE OUT: Did you hear from Denise, uh, Agent Bryson?
FADE OUT: The DEA and the Bureau have cleared me of all criminal
FADE OUT: charges. But the suspension stands. I'm waiting to hear
FADE OUT: from Gordon
FADE OUT: In the meantime you're still my deputy. This case is
FADE OUT: your's if you want it.
FADE OUT: Cooper looks at the body as it's carried out.
FADE OUT: I want it, Harry.
FADE OUT: Hawk enters.
FADE OUT: Found that stolen car on a logging road just as you said
FADE OUT: ... no prints. And just so you know, Hank Jennings
FADE OUT: missed the buy at Dead Dog because he was in the
FADE OUT: hospital. Claims he was hit by a bus. I cuffed him to
FADE OUT: the bed and booked him for parole violation. One more
FADE OUT: thing: Shelly Johnson just called. She says Leo Johnson
FADE OUT: came to last night, attacked her and ran off into the
FADE OUT: woods.
FADE OUT: Harry and Cooper react. Another flashbulb goes off.
FADE OUT: 11. INT. SHERIFF'S STATION, RECEPTION AREA - MORNING
FADE OUT: Close on Andy trying desperately to pull off the surgical gloves he is wearing. He yanks, he
FADE OUT: pulls, one last try and it shoots off across the room, sticking to the sliding window of
FADE OUT: Lucy's office. Lucy looks up as Andy peels it off the glass.

FADE OUT: Little Nicky?
FADE OUT: Dick and I have been doing some thinking and some
FADE OUT: looking and we think he's a ... he's a ...
FADE OUT: A what?
FADE OUT: The stretcher with the body is slowly wheeled out by TWO ATTENDANTS. One of the
FADE OUT: wheels squeaks incredibly loudly. Both Andy and Lucy's eyes are glued to the body as it
FADE OUT: slowly passes and exits.
FADE OUT: We think he murdered his parents.
FADE OUT: He's nine years old.
FADE OUT: I know. We think he was six at the time of the crime -
FADE OUT: I met little Nicky. I talked to little Nicky. If you two
FADE OUT: think, for one second that I'll believe a little defenseless
FADE OUT: orphan is a murderer ... the both of you aren't fit to be
FADE OUT: fathers to a chimp!
FADE OUT: Lucy reaches out, grabs one of the fingers on the glove Andy has on, stretches it out several feet
FADE OUT: and lets go... wap!
FADE OUT: I'm going to get to the bottom of this, right now.

POV: Looking under the hood of the Jaguar.
POV: JAMES moves out from under the hood, finds a smiling Jeffrey and EVELYN.
POV: I'm Jeffrey Marsh, James. I've been hearing very good
POV: things about your work from Evelyn.
POV: See how you feel when you drive it.
POV: I'm sure it will be fine. Sounds like it's lucky we found
POV: you.
POV: James can't place this pleasant man with the one who beats his wife. He feels like hell.
POV: Lucky for me too.
POV: I hear you're on the road.
POV: Yeah. Will be again soon, I guess.
POV: No itinerary, no deadlines ... I'm envious. Wish I was
POV: going with you.
POV: Evelyn locks her eyes on James who can feel the heat. Jeffrey opens the door to the car.
POV: Maybe after I take her out for a spin we'll talk shop.
POV: Sounds like we have a mutual love.
POV: Cars?
POV: 2.014 Revised 11-27-90, GREEN
POV: 14. CONTINUED:
POV: Yeah, I don't know, I'm kind of overdue already...
POV: Of course he'll stay. There are plenty of things I can
POV: find for him to do... right James?
POV: Yeah, maybe.
POV: Excuse me.
POV: James leaves, heads for his room.
POV: Nice kid.
POV: He looks at Evelyn.
POV: He's done a fine job on the car.
POV: Jeffrey slides into the car and ignites the engine. Races the motor.
POV: Let's see what it will do on the open road.
POV: Evelyn kisses him through the car window.
POV: Bye... Jeffrey.
POV: 15. INT. BEN'S OFFICE GREAT NORTHERN - DAY
POV: Close on the flames in the fireplace. We pull back. BEN HORNE, dressed as General Lee,
POV: puffs on a cigar as he sights a small cannon. On the floor of the office are toy soldiers in
POV: marching columns and an elaborate train set. DOCTOR JACOBY sits across the battle field,
POV: pencil and note pad in hand. The office doors swing open, Audrey enters with JERRY.
POV: Ben?
POV: He prefers General.
POV: He's marching on Washington. We think he's getting
POV: close.
POV: 2.014 Revised 11-27-90, GREEN
POV: 15. CONTINUED:
POV: Jeb!
POV: Jerry looks at Audrey.
POV: He thinks you're General Jeb Stuart.
POV: You're with the cavalry.
POV: Jeb, a great day is upon us. By dawn our troops will be
POV: on the outskirts of Washington. By mid-day it will fall,
POV: and we will once again walk on my cherished fields in
POV: Arlington.
POV: Only God can stop us now. And it is my firm belief,
POV: Jeb, that the almighty is a Southerner.
POV: Ben moves back to his soldiers. Jerry looks at Audrey, then back at his brother, tries to smile.
POV: Hallelujah ...
POV: Jerry glances over to Jacoby, motions him over to join Audrey and himself
POV: You think it's a good idea for Ben to be carrying a
POV: sword?
POV: Your brother is suffering from delusions brought about
POV: by emotional collapse. He thinks he's on a forced march
POV: to Washington. He's crossing the Maryland border as we
POV: speak.
POV: He's nuts.
POV: Why don't you let your uncle Jer decide that for himself.
POV: Ben picks up the flag and waves it.
POV: Oh, Ben.
POV: 2.014 Revised 11-26-90, PINK
POV: 15. CONTINUED:
POV: Actually what he is doing is quite healthy. By reversing the South's
POV: defeat in the civil war he will in turn reverse his own setbacks. What he
POV: needs now is both your understanding, a confederate victory, and a good
POV: price for his cotton. Metaphorically speaking.
POV: Jacoby smiles. Jerry looks over at Ben.
POV: Men of the South, from this day to the ending of the earth we who fight
POV: shall be remembered. For our bravery. For the battle scars we bear.
POV: We few. We happy few. We band of brothers. Onwards... to
POV: Washington.
POV: 16. INT. TRUMAN'S OFFICE - DAY
POV: Close on the chess board set found with the body. We slowly circle it, coming to Cooper,
POV: intently staring at it. Coffee cup in hand. Harry joins him.
POV: How does chess figure into all this?
POV: Cooper studies the board for a moment, then looks at Harry.
POV: Because we played a game every day for three years. Windom felt all
POV: of life could be found in the patterns and conflicts created on the board.
POV: And because I never beat him, and we both know it. Now I have to
POV: make my next move. I'll publish it in the Twin Peaks Chronicle
POV: tomorrow. That should do it. He's close.
POV: Coop, I think I need some more information here.
POV: Harry, I've brought some baggage to town with me I haven't told
POV: you about.
POV: Well, as your superior -
POV: Cooper turns to Harry. The coffee cup shakes in his hand. Both notice. For the first time
POV: Truman sees fear in Cooper's eyes.
POV: Windom Earle was my first partner. Everything I know about the law
POV: and the bureau I owe to him. Four years ago we drew the assignment of
POV: protecting a material witness in a federal crime. She was a very gentle,
POV: very beautiful woman. Her name was Caroline. She and I ... fell in love.
POV: 2.014 Revised 11-27-90, GREEN
POV: 16. CONTINUED:
POV: What happened?
POV: One night, I failed in my vigilance. An attack was
POV: made. I was wounded, stabbed, lost consciousness.
POV: When I awoke, Caroline was in my arms. She was dead.
POV: She had also been stabbed.
POV: The wounds on the vagrant?
POV: Identical. The killer was never caught. My wounds
POV: healed. Windom Earle ... went mad. Institutionalized,
POV: until his recent escape.
POV: So why is he after you now?
POV: Harry, Caroline was Windom Earle's wife.
POV: Harry takes a seat.
POV: So he blames you for her death.
POV: No. It's worse than that - much worse. I think he killed
POV: her. And I think he also committed the murder that she
POV: originally witnessed. He used to beat her, Harry, that's
POV: what I found out when I ...
POV: Windom's mind is ... like a diamond. It's cold and
POV: hard and brilliant and at some point he stopped caring
POV: about right and wrong. I also believe Windom feigned
POV: the insanity that sent him away. You don't know what
POV: he's capable of. You don't know.

POV: Wind whips thru the trees. MOVE DOWN to discover the Marsh House.
POV: 17. INT. JAMES ROOM, MARSH ESTATE - DAY
POV: CLOSE ON James' saddlebags, his things laying next to them on the bed, ready to be
POV: packed. Evelyn stands looking over them, fingering the clothes as James walks out of the
POV: bathroom. He stops when he sees her.
POV: Don't you knock?
POV: I'm sorry. Are you leaving?
POV: Yeah.
POV: He walks over to his bags.
POV: You were good with Jeffrey.
POV: It didn't feel like good.
POV: I can change that.
POV: 2.014
POV: 17. CONTINUED:
POV: She kisses him passionately, then begins to pull his shirt off. James pulls back.
POV: Look, I can't do this, it's wrong.
POV: Love isn't wrong, James, it's just complicated ...
POV: James walks over to the window, then turns and looks at her. The look melts her, and she
POV: realizes it.
POV: Please ... don't leave me. Don't leave me alone with
POV: him.
POV: They stare for a moment.
POV: I have to check my bike.
POV: James walks out. We move in on Evelyn as she turns and looks at James' saddlebags.
POV: 18. EXT. GARAGE - DAY
POV: James walks over to his bike, tries to gather himself. Then picks up a wrench. He wants to
POV: throw it but doesn't.
POV: 18A. JAGUAR WHEEL:
POV: The wheel fills the frame, slowly begins to spin faster and faster until it reaches a blur.
POV: 18B.THE WRENCH:

FADE TO BLACK: Close on a jukebox as a record is lowered onto the turntable. We pull back as DONNA
FADE TO BLACK: stands at the door. She moves to the bar.
FADE TO BLACK: Coffee, please.
FADE TO BLACK: The BARTENDER goes for the coffee. Donna takes in the scene. Sitting at the other end of
FADE TO BLACK: the bar is Evelyn. The bartender returns.
FADE TO BLACK: I'm looking for a biker. His name is James. James
FADE TO BLACK: Hurley. He's expecting me. He's expecting this.
FADE TO BLACK: She holds up an envelope. The Bartender looks her over, then glances at Evelyn and nods.
FADE TO BLACK: Donna takes out a cigarette. She strikes a match, we follow it up to the cigarette.
FADE TO BLACK: You look like someone in need of help.
FADE TO BLACK: Donna studies her for a moment.
FADE TO BLACK: Do I?
FADE TO BLACK: How old are you?
FADE TO BLACK: Eighteen.
FADE TO BLACK: Maybe I can help.
FADE TO BLACK: I can take care of myself
FADE TO BLACK: You on the road by yourself?

FADE TO BLACK: What's his name?
FADE TO BLACK: James.
FADE TO BLACK: James. James Hurley?
FADE TO BLACK: Yes, do you know him? Know where he is?
FADE TO BLACK: He did some work for me recently.
FADE TO BLACK: What kind of work?
FADE TO BLACK: He fixed my husband's car.
FADE TO BLACK: Donna tries to decide if this woman is a threat.
FADE TO BLACK: Where is he?
FADE TO BLACK: He left, yesterday. On his bike.
FADE TO BLACK: Where'd he go?
FADE TO BLACK: He said something about the ocean. Mexico. I'm not
FADE TO BLACK: sure.
FADE TO BLACK: That's all?
FADE TO BLACK: Evelyn shakes her head. Seems to really feel for Donna.
FADE TO BLACK: 2.014
FADE TO BLACK: 20. CONTINUED:
FADE TO BLACK: Are you what he's running away from?
FADE TO BLACK: Donna doesn't say anything, holds onto her coffee. Evelyn finishes her drink.
FADE TO BLACK: Why don't you go home, dear ... a girl like you ... he'll
FADE TO BLACK: be back.
FADE TO BLACK: Coffee's on me.
FADE TO BLACK: Evelyn walks away, Donna looks at the dollar bill, then turns as the bar doors swing shut. We

FADE TO BLACK: We follow NORMA taking a huge plate of potatoes and roast beef over to BIG ED, who's
FADE TO BLACK: seated with DOC HAYWARD.
FADE TO BLACK: Extra potatoes.
FADE TO BLACK: Norma smiles, she and Ed hold the look for a long moment.
FADE TO BLACK: Thanks.
FADE TO BLACK: She leaves. Doc notices the look between them.
FADE TO BLACK: Where's Nadine, Ed?
FADE TO BLACK: She's got a wrestling match up at Knife River. Doc,
FADE TO BLACK: Nadine's what I wanted to talk to you about. You're a
FADE TO BLACK: father, girl in high school ...
FADE TO BLACK: Doc, Nadine wants to start dating other boys, and I,
FADE TO BLACK: well, I don't know what to say.
FADE TO BLACK: Is she sexually active?
FADE TO BLACK: 2.014
FADE TO BLACK: 22. CONTINUED:
FADE TO BLACK: Active? I wake up every morning feeling like I've been
FADE TO BLACK: run over by a lumber truck.
FADE TO BLACK: The extra adrenaline.
FADE TO BLACK: It's downright dangerous. She's liable to kill a young
FADE TO BLACK: kid. I don't know what to do.
FADE TO BLACK: Be patient. And tell her to be home by nine o'clock on
FADE TO BLACK: school nights.
FADE TO BLACK: Ed, Donna took the van this morning, said something
FADE TO BLACK: about going to look for James. Is there anything I need
FADE TO BLACK: to be worried about?
FADE TO BLACK: He's out west a couple of hours, just trying to clear his head,
FADE TO BLACK: I think. Donna's taking him some money.
FADE TO BLACK: It's not easy being a parent is it?
FADE TO BLACK: It sure ain't.
FADE TO BLACK: Doc leaves, Norma walks over with a piece of pie. Slides in across from Ed.
FADE TO BLACK: Hank's in the hospital. He says a tree fell on him.
FADE TO BLACK: Doesn't have anything to do with this, does it?
FADE TO BLACK: The tree was a redwood named Nadine.
FADE TO BLACK: Honey, after you left yesterday, Hank jumped me, right
FADE TO BLACK: in my own living room. The truth is, if Nadine hadn't
FADE TO BLACK: walked in when she did, it'd be me in the hospital or
FADE TO BLACK: someplace worse.
FADE TO BLACK: Nadine took out Hank?
FADE TO BLACK: Yep. And it wasn't pretty.
FADE TO BLACK: 2.014
FADE TO BLACK: 22. CONTINUED:
FADE TO BLACK: Norma sits back, they study each other.
FADE TO BLACK: Harry called, they're arresting Hank for a parole
FADE TO BLACK: violation. When he's well, he could be going back to
FADE TO BLACK: prison. I think it's time I start correcting a few of the
FADE TO BLACK: mistakes I've made.
FADE TO BLACK: He reaches out, takes her hand.
FADE TO BLACK: We could start by getting a cabin, a bottle of sparkling
FADE TO BLACK: wine and some venison steaks.
FADE TO BLACK: People will find out.
FADE TO BLACK: Ed grips her hand.
FADE TO BLACK: Let'em.
FADE TO BLACK: Norma smiles, we move in on their fingers lacing around each other's.
FADE TO BLACK: 23. INT. SHERIFF STATION - DAY
FADE TO BLACK: CLOSE ON the the face of an exhausted MAJOR BRIGGS, standing at the front door, we
FADE TO BLACK: pull back. The Major is a wreck, barely makes it to Lucy's desk.
FADE TO BLACK: Major Briggs?
FADE TO BLACK: I need to see the Sheriff.
FADE TO BLACK: He looks at her, and slowly sinks to the floor.
FADE TO BLACK: 24. INT. TRUMAN'S OFFICE - DAY
FADE TO BLACK: The Major, Harry and Cooper all gulp very large glasses of water. Lucy stands by with a large
FADE TO BLACK: pitcher for refills. They all finish at the same time.
FADE TO BLACK: More?
FADE TO BLACK: I'm fine.
FADE TO BLACK: 2.014 Revised 11-26-90, PINK
FADE TO BLACK: 24. CONTINUED:
FADE TO BLACK: Fine.
FADE TO BLACK: Fine.
FADE TO BLACK: Lucy leaves. Truman and Cooper turn their attention to Briggs.
FADE TO BLACK: Major, what happened?
FADE TO BLACK: As men who have dedicated their lives to service, I know
FADE TO BLACK: you are able to understand how sacred I hold a pledge of
FADE TO BLACK: allegiance. And the cost one must pay when breaking a
FADE TO BLACK: pledge.
FADE TO BLACK: It can be very great.
FADE TO BLACK: The Air Force, I thought was not unlike other societies
FADE TO BLACK: of men, dedicated to the fight for good.
FADE TO BLACK: Harry and Cooper look at each other wondering. Briggs gets up from his chair.
FADE TO BLACK: Gentlemen, frankly I'm worried. When my superiors
FADE TO BLACK: questioned me about my disappearance they exhibited a
FADE TO BLACK: degree of suspicion and intolerance bordering on the
FADE TO BLACK: paranoic. I must now admit that their motivation in the
FADE TO BLACK: search for the White Lodge is not ideologically pure.
FADE TO BLACK: I believe that during my disappearance I was taken to
FADE TO BLACK: the White Lodge. I remember virtually nothing, but I
FADE TO BLACK: have the clear intuitive sense that there is much trouble
FADE TO BLACK: ahead.
FADE TO BLACK: What kind of trouble?
FADE TO BLACK: I am not aware of the form it will take.
FADE TO BLACK: I will return. Until that time, I will be in the shadows if
FADE TO BLACK: you need me. Good day, gentlemen.
FADE TO BLACK: 2.014 Revised 11-27-90, GREEN
FADE TO BLACK: 24. CONTINUED:
FADE TO BLACK: On that note he leaves. Harry and Cooper are left a little dumbstruck.
FADE TO BLACK: The shadows?... Can you beat that.
FADE TO BLACK: Nope.
FADE TO BLACK: Andy knocks and enters.
FADE TO BLACK: Excuse me, Sheriff, Agent Cooper, may I show you
FADE TO BLACK: something?
FADE TO BLACK: He leaves, Truman and Cooper follow.
FADE TO BLACK: 25. INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
FADE TO BLACK: Truman and Cooper enter, join Hawk and Andy. At the other end of the room stand Jacoby
FADE TO BLACK: and LANA.
FADE TO BLACK: Good, I wanted everyone to hear this. I have just spent
FADE TO BLACK: most of the last twenty four hours with this charming
FADE TO BLACK: young lady. And as you can see, I have no bruises, no
FADE TO BLACK: broken bones. Any claims by her deceased husband's
FADE TO BLACK: brother that she is cursed and somehow responsible for a
FADE TO BLACK: death is nonsense. What she does possess is a heightened
FADE TO BLACK: sexual drive and a working knowledge of technique,
FADE TO BLACK: anatomy, and touch, few men have ever had the pleasure
FADE TO BLACK: of experiencing, or the skill to match.
FADE TO BLACK: Lana blushes, smiles. Looks them all over. Pause.
FADE TO BLACK: Is it warm in here?
FADE TO BLACK: Yes.
FADE TO BLACK: Cooper steps forward, extends his hand.
FADE TO BLACK: Lana, let me be the first to congratulate you.
FADE TO BLACK: Thank you. I could never have done it without Dr.
FADE TO BLACK: Jacoby.
FADE TO BLACK: 2.014 Revised 11-27-90, GREEN
FADE TO BLACK: 25. CONTINUED:
FADE TO BLACK: Okay. Well, then, we're going bowling.
FADE TO BLACK: Jacoby and Lana walk out. They all look at each other for a moment. Cooper whistles, as in
FADE TO BLACK: "Put your lips together and blow."
FADE TO BLACK: Amen.
FADE TO BLACK: A moment later we HEAR a scream.
FADE TO BLACK: 26. INT. HALLWAY - DUSK
FADE TO BLACK: Jacoby and Lana are staring down the barrel of a huge shotgun, held by DWAYNE
FADE TO BLACK: MILFORD. Truman, Cooper, Hawk and Andy rush into the hall. Their guns drawn.
FADE TO BLACK: Don't anybody move. Shoot and I'll take'em both with
FADE TO BLACK: me.
FADE TO BLACK: Mr. Mayor, put the gun down.

POV: Anybody moves and I'll blast her to kingdom come.
POV: The gun swings back to Lana and Jacoby.
POV: And the hippie too.
POV: We pull back.
POV: Mr. Mayor, this is not going to solve anything.
POV: She killed my brother!
POV: Mr. Mayor, Lana has killed no one.
POV: Horse dung. Come over here, Lana. Come over here.
POV: No one moves. Cooper steps up.
POV: Fellas, why don't we let the Mayor and Lana talk this
POV: over alone.
POV: I don't want to talk, I want to shoot.
POV: You can always shoot later, Dwayne. Talk first.
POV: Right in here. Go ahead, Lana, it'll be fine.
POV: Dwayne backs into the conference room with a reluctant Lana and closes the door.

POV: Wait.
POV: Wait?
POV: Cooper nods. Pause.
POV: Are you sure?
POV: Nope.
POV: They wait; it's not as easy as it sounds. After several silent moments, Jacoby starts to chuckle,
POV: then stops. Several long moments pass. Everyone is getting fidgety.
POV: It's kind of hard ... waiting.
POV: Everyone nods. Several more moments pass. Jacoby chuckles again. More silence, then
POV: Cooper steps over to the door of the conference room and listens.
POV: OK.
POV: He motions Hawk to the other door, they all take out their guns, then burst in.
POV: 28. INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT
POV: All guns are trained on Dwayne ... with Lana sitting in his lap in the middle of a deep,
POV: passionate kiss. The guns are all holstered. Dwayne, covered in lipstick, finishes the kiss and
POV: looks up, beaming.
POV: We've decided to adopt a child.
POV: Lana kisses him again.
POV: He's so much like Dougie, I feel like my husband's been
POV: brought back to life.
POV: I've been lonely and selfish. I hope you'll all forgive
POV: my boorish behavior. Come along, dear.

POV: into a smile, and points at the sheet of paper.
POV: Hot dogs, we forgot hot dogs.
POV: CATHERINE enters, studies the scene for a moment.
POV: Did Josie go shopping yet?
POV: Yep, but we forgot the wienies. All beef, with the skin

POV: to show you.
POV: Catherine walks over to the office doors, Pete follows several feet behind. They stand at the
POV: closed doors for a moment.
POV: Have you asked yourself, Pete, how I survived after the
POV: fire? How I was able to effect my transformation into
POV: Tojamura and marshall the resources I needed to defeat
POV: Ben and win back the mill?
POV: Now that you mention it ... yeah.
POV: Catherine opens the doors, revealing ANDREW PACKARD. Pete is speechless.
POV: If it isn't sneaky Pete Martell.
POV: Andrew ... I saw the boat ... you ... you ...
POV: Take all the time you need. Good old Pete.
POV: As you can surmise, I had Andrew's help.
POV: So, let me get this straight, you didn't die in the boat
POV: accident.
POV: We didn't tell you, Pete, with apologies beforehand,
POV: because you didn't need to know. And frankly ... we
POV: didn't want you to.
POV: Okay. Well, if you're bringing anybody else back from
POV: the dead, I vote for Veronica Lake.

POV: Lord, who tried to push the button on you, Andy?
POV: Does the name Thomas Eckhardt mean anything to you?
POV: No.
POV: Eckhardt and I were business partners. I knew lumber, he
POV: knew Hong Kong. We made a lot of money, had some
POV: fun ... then I got the better of him in a piece of business
POV: and he tried to stab me in the back ...
POV: Really?
POV: In a manner of speaking. He's a very dangerous and
POV: powerful opponent.
POV: He plotted Andrew's death for six years. After he
POV: thought Andrew was dead he came after me.
POV: Does Josie know you're alive, Andy?
POV: Catherine and Andrew glance at each other. As if talking to a child.
POV: Pete, dear, Josie worked for Eckhardt.
POV: That's right. She did? My God ... is she still?
POV: We'll find out when Eckhardt arrives.
POV: He's coming here?

POV: The fax machine begins to beep. Truman steps behind the desk to retrieve the incoming
POV: message. We see concern on his face. Andy and Cooper sit behind him.
POV: Lucy walks in with Doc Hayward and DICK TREMAYNE. Everyone stops, sizes up the
POV: situation. A stern Doc zeros in on Andy.
POV: Andy, in here, we're going to talk.
POV: Andy dutifully follows Doc into Truman's office. Truman studies the fax. Troubled.
POV: Coop, we've got another problem. I need to ask you a
POV: favor.
POV: That brings him back.
POV: Harry, there's something we have to get straight. You're
POV: in charge, I work for you now. You say jump, I'll jump.
POV: Cooper smiles, so does Harry.
POV: This just came over the wire from Seattle.
POV: He shows him a clipping from a Seattle newspaper. MURDERED MAN FOUND IN
POV: ALLEY NEAR AIRPORT. And a picture of Jonathan, the Asian man. Murdered.
POV: She told me she got away from him.
POV: You think she is responsible for this?

POV: Close on Andy and Dick seated next to each other. Doc stands above them, his arms folded
POV: across his chest. Lucy vigorously paces the room.
POV: When Lucy told me about your "theory" I called the
POV: orphanage and cut through the red tape. I immediately
POV: got to the bottom of things because I was there when it
POV: all begin. Little Nicky is no more a murderer than
POV: Lucy or I.
POV: I believe pathological was the phrase we used, Doc -
POV: Dick, I didn't drop you on your head when I brought you
POV: into this world, don't give me cause to regret that.
POV: Doc, it's just -
POV: Shut up and listen, the both of you.
POV: Lucy smacks a bug with a flyswatter like it's a baseball.
POV: Little Nicky entered this world through the back door
POV: where hope and promise never saw the light. His mother
POV: was a poor immigrant chambermaid at the Great
POV: Northern. Nicky was conceived during an assault by a
POV: man in a back alley who fled across the border. She
POV: never reported it to the police, but when she started to
POV: show she reported it to me. But Nicky's mother had a
POV: dream for a better life, for herself and her child. It was
POV: the dream that brought her to this country. She decided
POV: to carry that child. The poor wretch never saw the boy.
POV: She died just as Nicky took his first breath. I delivered
POV: that woman's baby. We buried her in Potter's Field and
POV: sent the infant to the orphanage. For several years he was
POV: shuttled from one state home to another. Then one day,
POV: hope finally shined on little Nicky. A young childless
POV: couple brought him into their lives. They were loving,
POV: caring parents. It all collapsed in one terrible moment
POV: on an icy highway. There was a crash. Six year old
POV: Nicky managed to pull both his parents from the
POV: burning wreck, but it was too late, and Nicky was alone
POV: once again, as he is today.

POV: I have two suites reserved.
POV: Name?
POV: Eckhardt.
POV: Jones turns and looks across the lobby. Standing by the fireplace is Thomas Ekhardt,
POV: a mysterious, severe looking man, wearing sunglasses. The Clerk studies them for a
POV: moment, sensing something different about these two people.
POV: Welcome to Twin Peaks.
POV: Jones nods to Eckhardt. We move in on him as he turns toward the fireplace. The flames
POV: reflect in his glasses, we move in tight as the sound of the flames becomes louder and louder.

POV: I can't stay here anymore.
POV: I don't understand -
POV: It's wrong.
POV: She pulls away from him.
POV: Because ... because I'm married.
POV: Yes. Yes.
POV: She walks over to the window, looks out. A police car pulls up.
POV: I love you, James.
POV: Save it.
POV: I've never said that to anyone in my life, but I'm saying
POV: it to you now.
POV: ANGLE OUT WINDOW, as two OFFICERS exit the car. BACK ON EVELYN, she

POV: Someone moving clumsily through the trees, smashing and breaking branches. Heavy
POV: labored breathing can be heard. Then a wolf howls, we spin around looking for it. The gentle
POV: sounds of a flute become audible drifting through the forest. We pull back. It's Leo, he starts
POV: to follow the music.
POV: A CABIN, a candle in the window. The music drifts out. Leo crashes through some brush,
POV: and sees it. An owl hoots.
POV: 35. INT. CABIN - NIGHT
POV: The cabin is in shadow except for the candle by the window. We SEE a hand set down an
POV: ornate wooden flute, then pick up a gun. The door swings open. Leo stands there, panting,
POV: damaged.
POV: Bar ... bar of soap ... bad girl...
POV: Leo laughs, focuses on the figure in the doorway, the gun. He takes a step backward.
POV: No, no. Come in.
POV: It's all right, I'm a friend. Come in.
POV: Leo tentatively steps in.
POV: You look like you've had a very hard night.
