EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY
SHERIFF TRUMAN angry and frustrated, walks with AGENT COOPER, HAWK, and
ALBERT ROSENFIELD through the hospital/morgue parking lot. It's early. A thick fog,
hangs in the air.
The short answer is it's the work of the same ghoul who
killed Laura.
More fan mail. An "O" under Maddy's ring fingernail ...
She had strands of fur clutched in her right hand.
What kind of fur?
White fox. The strands are laced with formaldehyde.
A dead animal. Stuffed.
Truman's not listening. He's got the killer in custody, or so he thinks. Investigative details are
no longer his concern.
I should make the calls. Leland will know how to get a
hold of Maddy's family -
Don't. Don't call anybody. I need twenty-four hours.
For what?
To finish this.
It is finished.
Stalemate. Albert intervenes, takes Cooper aside.
#2.009.5d Revised 10-3-90, GREEN
Cooper ... an observation?
Yes, Albert.
I don't where this is headed, but the only one of us with
the coordinates for this destination in their hardware is
you. Lock in. Go on whatever Vision Quest you require,
stand on the rim of the volcano. Stand alone and do
your dance. Just find this beast before he takes another
bite.
And perhaps you could follow behind him with a
buglight attached to a pith helmet.
Albert offers a snide farewell wave to Truman, peels off to his automobile. Cooper steps back
to Truman and Hawk.
God help me, I don't know where to start.
Hawk puts a hand on his shoulder.
You're on the path. You don't need to know where it
leads. Just follow.
Cooper looks at him. Then to Truman.
Good luck.
INT. DOUBLER DINER - DAY
DONNA HAYWARD sits in a booth in the morning sun, sipping coffee and working on her
homework. A smiling JAMES HURLEY enters passing by ERNIE NILES who sits at the
counter reading the sports page. Donna beams at James.
I thought you'd never get here.
#2.009.1 Revised 10-3-90, PINK
James smiles and gives Donna a morning-after kiss. He slides in across from Donna. Takes a
sip of her coffee.
I went out for a ride this morning. Buried the needle.
The engine sounded like music, like hundreds of people
singing some huge song.
What were they singing about?
What do you think?
Last night. I could sing about last night.
James digs in his pocket and takes out a small gift-wrapped package.
This is for you.
Open it.
Donna opens the box. Takes out a beautiful, but simple ring with the smallest of diamonds.
Oh, James.
I wasn't sure what size to get. The girl at the jewelry
store has these big hands so I had to guess ...
But I bet ...
He slides the ring on her finger, where one would wear a wedding band.
Perfect.
James ... ?
#2.009.4d
I think we should always be together.
Really?
Yeah. That okay with you?
It's perfect.
James leans across the table, means to kiss her, the table and coffee between them. Donna
laughs, James grins. Then gathers her into his arms the best he can, offers a lasting kiss.
He slides up next to ERNIE who smiles watching Donna and James.
You ever in love in the joint, Ern?
Disgusted, Ernie goes back to his paper - the sports pages - trying to avoid Hank
Remember that fourth floor game room? Where the
boys did business? You played along or they tossed you
over the rail. Four floors down to the cement. Guy
landed it sounded like a cannon.
I'm not interested in whatever you're selling, Hank.
No, you got it backwards. You are interested, Ernie. I
got a piece of something North of the Border, little
gambling, some female company. Full service kind of
place. See, Ernie, the way I figure it, your speciality
being arithmatic -
I have an MBA from Wharton's -
Revised 10-3-90, PINK
#2009.1 5.
Excuse me. Here's the deal. I want this operation to
grow. You're a guy who knows how to grease it. I'll need
your help. And a good-sized chunk of Vivian's do-re-
me. Kind of an "Inlaw Thing."
You're confusing "In-law with Inmate."
Either way we're talking about prison, aren't we?
Our commonality of wrongdoing has nothing to do with
true bonding.
No, you see it's just like being back in the joint. 'Cause
we got a fourth floor on the outside, too.
Ernie tries to rise, Hank holds him firmly, moves closer, smiles.
Don't make me give you the rail, Ern.
Ernie is chilled by Hank's threat.
Norma watches Ernie move away. Vivian sits in front of an omelette.
They are up to something.
Norma, Norma, Norma ... darling, let the scales fall
from your eyes.
The men you and I fall for are boys. My legacy to you,
I'm afraid, dear; strutting, adorable juveniles. We wipe
their noses, wash their underwear, tie their shoes -
Hank was doing hard time, not juvenile detention.
That may be. But wherever they find themselves the men
we love spend their life in the dark. And in Ernie's case,
#2.009
he's very good in the dark.
Our job is to keep them there.
She takes bite of the omelette. Points to it.
Oh dear. Whatever fowl did you take these eggs from?
Are we saying we don't like it?
I'm afraid I'm going to hit a thumbtack.
Can't you say anything nice? Mother, I've tried so hard,
I try so hard and, and nothing's good enough for you; no,
let me correct that, nothing I do, I ever do is good
enough -
The menu's are very presentable -
I'm joking. Honestly, may I suggest something? If you
want to serve a truly memorable omelette, try some
white veal sausage with some morel mushrooms -
Thanks. I'll go pick the mushrooms.
4A. DEPUTY ANDY BRENNAN
Andy sits at the counter, feeling blue, ignoring the pie before him. He mutters a phrase to
himself, as if to test the words, perhaps commit them to memory.
J'ai une...J'ai une ame solitaire...
Big sigh. Somehow it makes Andy feel better. As Donna and James step toward the register,
he repeats, a little more confidentally:
#2.009
4A. CONTINUED:
J'ai une ame solitaire.
Donna reacts to the familiar phrase with a start.
What did you say?
Nothing. Hello, Donna and James.
Tell me what you said.
It's French.
I know what it is. Tell me.
Hey, it's no big deal.
J'ai une ame solitaire.
How do you know Mrs. Tremond?
Mrs. Who?
Mrs. Tremond. Her grandson does magic tricks. He
said this to me.
But it was Mr. Smith.
Harold ... ?
#2.009.1 Revised 10-3-90, PINK
4A. CONTINUED:(2)
Andy nods, leans closer to impart a confidence.
He left a suicide note. J'ai une, you know. It means I am
a lonely soul.
I have to find Agent Cooper.
Donna, what the hell is going on?
Donna turns for the door. James calls after, frustrated:
Donna!
5A. EXT. MRS. TREMOND'S HOUSE - DAY
Donna leads Cooper and Andy up the path to Mrs. Tremond's house, directly across from
Harold Smith's. In mid-speech:
Mrs. Tremond is the woman who told me about Harold
Smith. She has a grandson. And he said it to me. The
same words that were in Harold Smith's suicide note ...
Maybe the boy said the same thing to Harold.
Harold's world was in words. The suicide note was a
message, it has to be. And it leads back here ...
Donna knocks on Mrs. Tremond's door. A long beat.
She's pretty old. If her grandson isn't here to open it ...
There's someone inside.
#2.009.4d
5A. CONTINUED:
Just then: the door opens, revealing a WOMAN. Middle-aged. Pleasant in appearance. And
most decidedly not Mrs. Tremond.
May I help you ... ?
Is Mrs. Tremond here?
I'm Mrs. Tremond.
Maybe it was your mother I spoke to.
My mother passed away three years ago. I live alone.
No. I was here. I talked to her. And her grandson, he
was here too.
But I have no children.
But he was here. They were both here...
Donna, maybe we should go.
Donna? Donna Hayward?
Yes.
Just a moment ...
Mrs. Tremond goes back inside.
#2.009.4d
5A. CONTINUED:(2)
I've never seen her before in my life.
But you said you delivered meals here -
I only went inside once. The first time. When the old
woman told me about Harold. I'm supposed to leave
them on the steps ...
Mrs. Tremond returns holding an envelope.
The morning after poor Harold died, I found this with
my mail. I meant to turn it in ...
It's for you.
Mrs. Tremond holds the envelope toward Donna. Her name is written there.
It's Harold's handwriting.
Open it.
She does. Reveals a single page inside.
It's Laura's diary; A page from her diary.
Read it, Donna.
A long beat. Donna peering at the familiar handwriting. Finally, in a whisper.
February 21st. Last night I had the strangest dream. I
was in a red room with a small man dressed in red and
an old man, sitting in a chair.
Cooper reacts. He had the same dream. Laura, the midget, forgotten secrets whispered in his
ear.
#2.009.4d
5A. CONTINUED:(3)
I tried to talk to him. I wanted to tell him who Bob is
because I thought he could help me. But my words came
out slow and odd. It was so frustrating trying to talk. I
got up and walked over to the old man. Like I was
going to kiss him. Then I leaned over and whispered the
secret in his ear. I told him everything.
Somebody has to stop Bob. Bob's only afraid of one
man. He told me once. A man named Mike. I wonder
if this was Mike in my dream. Even if it was only a
dream, I hope he heard me. No one in the real world
would believe me.
Donna completes the page, now turns to the other side. She reads:
February 22nd. Tonight is the night that I die.
I know I have to because it is the only way to keep Bob
away from me. The only way to tear him out from
inside. I know he wants me. I can feel his fire. But if I
die he can't hurt me anymore.
I'm not afraid. I'll miss Donna and James. I'll miss my
home. But I'm tired and Bob won't let me rest. Death
will be like sleeping. I'm almost happy. And best of
all ... I'm free.
Donna looks up at Cooper, tears on her face. Andy's crying too. He puts his arm around her,
comforts her.
Laura and I had the same dream. But in her dream I was
Mike.
That's ... that's impossible.
Yes, it is. Andy, take Donna home. I've got to find
Gerard.
Cooper moves off.
#2.009.4d 12.
5C. INT. GREAT NORTHERN HOTEL ROOM - DAY
Cooper enters cautiously. PHILLIP GERARD, wheezing and barely conscious, lies without
bedclothes on a stripped mattress. DOC HAYWARD lays wet compresses on Gerard's
forehead. Cooper moves to Hayward.
He's completely dehydrated. Breathing getting more
difficult. He needs the drug.
Cooper moves to kneel beside Gerard.
"Mike?" Mike, I need to speak to you.
Any longer could kill him.
A terrifying groan from Gerard.
"Mike?"
Gerard opens his eyes, takes Cooper's hand, nods, weakly.
There isn't much time. Bob has killed again.
Gerard winces, pained, looks away. Cooper brings him back.
I'm close to knowing. But the last distance to close is
the most difficult. I need to know something. I need
you to help me.
Gerard nods, grasps his hand, eager to help.
Bob was in my dream. So was Laura Palmer. So were
you. And Laura dreamt about me the night before she
died. The same dream. I need to go back there and
unlock my dream. The answer is inside.
He leans over him to hear. Gerard struggles with every word. Fighting to stay Mike.
Bob is a fire spirit. So are we both, both creatures of
#2.009.4d
5C. CONTINUED:
fire. Bob and I ... when we were killing together ... there
was a perfect relationship; appetite and satisfaction. A
golden circle.
A golden circle ...
Gerard gives him the "OK" sign. Which triggers another thought for Cooper.
A ring. My ring. I gave my ring to someone. The
Giant.
He is known to us here.
The Giant. Is he real?
As real as I am. He can lead you to Bob.
How?
You have to ask him first.
I'm sorry, I don't understand -
You have all the clues you need. The answer's not here,
my friend.
The answer is here.
He touches Cooper's chest.
I don't understand, please -
So much responsibility.
Gerard goes slack in his arms. "Mike" is gone. Cooper holds Gerard's limp body. He looks
at Doc.
#2.009.4d
5D. INT. GREAT NORTHERN HALLWAY - DAY
Cooper exits Gerard's room. He stops to think. Behind him, around the corner comes the
world's oldest ROOM SERVICE WAITER. He's carrying a tray with a glass of milk. He
stops to look at Cooper. Cooper realizes he's being watch and turns.
I know about you.
The Waiter winks at him. Cooper looks at him puzzled.
That milk'll cool down on you, but it's getting warmer now.
The Waiter gives him a thumbs up and moves slowly along.
... getting warmer now.
The Waiter turns once, gives him another thumbs up and disappears around the corner.
INT. BEN HORNE'S OFFICE - DAY
Sound of DISTANT THUNDER outside. A storm is approaching. Truman and a team of
deputies are methodically searching the room. Truman going through records at the desk.
Box and tag everything in these drawers.
Cooper appears, pauses on the steps by the door.
Coop. We found Horne's phone records.
Here it is. The night Laura died. The phone call Leland
told us about. Ben called her number from this office.
Cooper spots the STUFFED FOX in the office, walks to it, as if he was the only person in
the room. Examines the fur.
White fox.
White, dead and stuffed.
#2.009.5d Revised 10-8-90, GREEN
Maddy was here. There was a struggle; she grabbed this
thing. Ben killed her in this office, then took her to the
waterfall. He killed Laura and he killed Maddy, too.
Albert stands in the doorway from the inner office. He steps through the deputies to Cooper.
Madelaine Ferguson died night before last between ten
p.m. and midnight.
Ben Horne was in custody by midnight.
That's as close as I can cut it.
Ben Horne's blood test.
Cooper glances at the information inside, hands paper to Albert. Albert peers at the results.
Then, gradually, hands them to Truman. HOLD ON Truman for a beat. His ambiguous
expression.
Cooper?
Cooper turns to Albert and Truman.
I'll need you both to do exactly as I say. I have a plan.
6A. OMITTED
INT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE, RECEPTION AREA - DAY
The now-familiar plumber, ZIPPER, stands on a ladder at reception, working on a sprinkler-
system nozzle in the ceiling. Lucy sits below the ladder at her desk
... 'nother couple minutes, I'll have this baby right up to
code. Tweaking the sensors mostly. Don't want your
sprinklers to be overly jumpy, you gotta set it just so ...
#2.009.4d
ANDY BRENNAN suddenly appears on the other side of the ladder.
I want to talk about my child.
Our baby, Lucy.
Maybe.
Maybe what?
Maybe it is our baby. Maybe it isn't.
Dick? Oh my Lord. Is he the father?
At first I thought you were the father. But then you said
you didn't have any sperms. Then I thought it was Dick.
But now you tell me your sperms are better so as far as I
can tell it's a fifty-fifty proposition.
Andy grabs the phone, begins to dial with grim determination.
Andy? What are you doing? Who are you calling?
I want to speak with Richard Tremayne, please. Men's
Fashions. Yes, I'll hold.
You won't hurt him, will you?
Andy flashes a look at Lucy worthy of John Wayne. I'll do what I have to do. Lucy melts just a
little. Andy takes a deep breath.
Tremayne? Brennan. Andy Brennan. We need to talk.
That is, if you're not too busy.
#2.009.4d
INT. SHERIFF'S STATION - DAY
Ben Horne aimlessly pitches pennies against his cell wall. A DEPUTY opens the door.
Tojomura steps into view, pauses. Ben smiles as if they were meeting at a Men's Club.
Tojomura-san. How nice of you to come calling.
You are in prison.
A momentary inconvenience, I assure you.
For whom?
Tojomura's sarcasm, however muted, takes Ben by surprise.
Only myself. Can I help you in any way?
We have papers to sign.
The Ghostwood contracts. Tojomura-san, I'm afraid
there's been a snag.
Snag?
The usual business disputes, delays. Unforeseen
difficulties, some legal in nature, others ... I'm not able
to sign the Ghostwood agreement at this time.
I gave you five million dollars.
Your check.
Yes. Pen?
#2.009.4d
But I cannot sign.
Then you will return my money?
Well, I want to return your money, I want to sign the
contracts for Chrissakes ...
Tojomura-san, as you can see, I am incarcerated.
Falsely accused. My brother the boy-genius is out
looking for a better lawyer. And until justice is done,
until I am able to breathe the air that free men breathe ...
I plead with you for understanding. This is the long
dark night of my soul. A time to seek that tiny
flickering flame within. Business my God, I can hardly
consider it, let alone competently proceed with our
negotiations
Forgive me I've been rather emotional lately ...
Ben pauses. He'd cry if he could force a few measly tears from his ducts. A beat. Faint noise
from outside the cell. And last is a naked foot comes INTO VIEW, placed gently between
the bars, toenails painted a bright cherry red. Ben, head hanging, stares down at them. His
brain reels. He'd know those toes anywhere.
Ca ... Ca ... Catherine?
Ben looks up, amazed. Tojomura speaks in the VOICE of CATHERINE MARTELL.
CATHERINE/TOJOMURA
Benjamin Home, you're a slimey rat bastard. And I
intend to make whatever remains of your pathetic
existance a living hell. Despite which, I can't help
admiring your style just the tiniest bit ...
"...that tiny flickering flame within."
Overcome, Ben takes Catherine's foot into his hands. As if to caress and kiss it.
Oh, Catherine. Oh thank God you've come. You're my
only chance. My salvation.
#2.009.4d
Why, Ben. You're groveling.
Yes I'm groveling. Dammit, I'm groveling for my life.
Tell Sheriff Truman about the night we spent together.
The night Laura was killed. Do you want me to beg?
Because I will.
Will you sign over Ghostwood and the mill to me?
In a heartbeat.
Catherine thrusts the contracts through the bars and smiles. Ben scribbles his signature upon
the contracts. Catherine slips her naked foot back into its shoe.
Clever disguise, Catherine. Brilliant really. Had me
completely snowed. I have to hand it to you. Signed,
sealed, delivered ...
And so you'Il tell the Sheriff ...?
I'll ... consider it.
Catherine slips the contract into her jacket pocket, steps away. Ben hisses after.
Catherine! Wait a minute! Catherine!! Wait!
My God, it's the truth after all!
Catherine pauses at the door, regards him with a wicked smile.
Why, Ben. We've been lying to each other all our adult
lives. Why let the truth spoil it now?
And with that, Catherine walks away.
Catherine?! Catherine!!

Establish. The sky dark and filled with angry storm clouds. Perhaps a lightning flash.
INT. PALMER HOUSE - DAY
Donna stands in the living room, wearing Laura's dark glasses. Leland beams.
Donna, I'm so happy you stopped by. We haven't really
had time to sit down and talk in so long, Can I offer
you a glass of lemonade?
No, thank you, Mr. Palmer. I only have a minute...
This is for Maddy. It's a tape of a song we did with
James. I wanted her to have a copy.
Of course. How sweet of you. Maddy told me all
about that. She said she really enjoyed the experience.
Well anyway. If you could mail it to her I'd really
appreciate it.
That won't be any trouble at all.
Donna notices Leland staring at her glasses.
Is something wrong?
No ... those glasses ...
They were Laura's. Maddy gave them to me.
I thought they looked familiar.
Donna takes out a cigarette. Lights it.
Mr. Palmer, did you know they found Laura's secret
#2.009.4d
diary?
Diary? Yes, they took it from her room.
Not the one the police took. She kept another diary.
She never even told me about it, did you know?
No.
She gave it to a man named Harold Smith. He killed
himself three days ago. The police found it in his
apartment.
My God. I had no idea.
I wish I knew, what was in it, don't you? I think about
her all the time. I must dream about Laura every night.
Just then: the phone RINGS.
Excuse me...
Leland moves into the alcove to answer the phone.
Hello ... Beth, how are you? ... No, not since yesterday ...
Of course, I put Maddy on the bus myself ... I'm sure
there's a perfectly reasonable explanation ... yes, I'll call
you immediately, within the hour. 'Bye.
Donna has taken tentative steps toward him during the latter. He hangs up and turns to her.
Maddy?
It's the strangest thing. She never made it home.
#2.009.4d
Oh, God ...
#2.009.4d
INT. PALMER HOUSE - DAY
I knew Maddy was expecting us the other night. But I
was selfish. I figured I could see her any time. I mean
Missoula's not that far away ...
Donna, you musn't take this to heart. I'm sure she's fine.
I've got the cure for what ails you. It's simple, really.
But it always improves my mood.
Leland scurries over to the stereo, sets needle to vinyl. An old thirties dance tune is HEARD.
He does a couple of soft shoe steps in Donna's direction. Then ... a KNOCK at the door.
Wait right here.
Leland steps off to answer. He opens the door, Sheriff Truman man enters, brushes rain from
his coat. They converse quietly in the alcove. Donna remains out of sight.
Harry.
Leland, we need your help.
What is it?
I'm afraid there's been another murder.
Oh my God. Oh my God, that's dreadful.
Leland, we're closing in on Laura's killer. I can't tell
you why or how but we need your help and we need it
now.
Of course. Certainly. Anything. Let me get my coat.
#2.009.4d
Leland grabs a jacket from a hanger nearby. He steps with Truman toward the door,
glancing briefly toward the living room, Donna left behind him.
Donna listens to the door slam. Her eyes bright with tears. There has been another murder.
EXT. HAYWARD HOUSE - DAY
Doc Hayward works in his yard. He sighs, full of sadness.
Dad?
Hayward looks up, sees Donna standing before him. Full of sorrow. And rage. Hayward gets
to his feet. A beat, then:
It's Maddy, isn't it? She's dead.
Let's not talk about it now.
Tell me the truth.
I'm so sorry. Yes, she's...
How?
Like Laura.
No ... no ...
Baby ...
Donna shudders with anger, overcome. Her father steps to her, tries to take Donna into his
arms. But Donna rips free from his grasp. She will not be comforted.
NO! I am sick and tired of all this pain. Sick in my
heart. Everything good turns to bad. No matter what
#2.009.5c Revised 10-8-90, GREEN
we say or do. No matter how hard we try. Someone has
to stop it. Someone has to ...
I love you, Donna.
I don't want to talk about love. I...
Donna can't stand it. She turns and runs.
EXT. THE ROADHOUSE - DAY
Establish. The storm now grips the region. Thunder and lightning in the dark sky.
INT. THE ROADHOUSE -DAY
Truman and Leland walk through the Roadhouse interior. Cooper and Albert are sitting at
the bar. The mood is dreamlike, eerie. And will remain so throughout the following,
punctuated by the sound of the storm outside.
Why are we here? Agent Cooper? Is someone meeting
us?
Yes.
The killer?
I don't know. Perhaps.
The main door opens. Big Ed Hurley enters; Ed looks about, a little confused.
What's going on here?
I want everyone to help me clear the floor. We're going
#2.009.5c Revised 10-8-90, GREEN
to need a large clear space in the center.
Of course.
Only too happy to help.
Cooper hefts a chair, moves it from the center of the room. Ed, Hawk, Albert and Leland
grab chairs, slide them toward the walls. Cooper returns to push at a table.
You need me, just give the word.
Ed gives the Bookhouse Boys sign.
SHELLY JOHNSON wheels LEO JOHNSON into the room. Muttering, Bobby Briggs is
led in by Hawk.
Give yourself a raise, Hawk.
Bobby, wheel Leo to the bar and be very, very quiet. Do
you read me?
Bobby sighs, wheels Leo as directed.
Cooper clears the last table to the side. There is now a large open space at the center of the
room. Cooper turns to regard it, checks his watch as if expecting someone else. All eyes are
upon him. Ed and the others watch Cooper with varying degrees of confusion.
The main door OPENS, Truman escorts Ben Horne inside. All turn to view him.
Hail, hail, the gang's all here.
Truman leads Ben to the others. Cooper turns to address the group.
#2.009.5d Revised 10-8-90, GREEN
Two days ago, another young woman was murdered by
the indivudual responsible for the death of Laura Palmer.
I have reason to believe the killer is inside this room.
Some react with looks of disbelief - followed by glances at the men next to them. BEN
keeps a cold eye on Cooper.
As a Federal Agent I spend most of my time seeking
simple answers to difficult questions. In pursuit of
Laura's killer, I have used Bureau guidelines, deductive
technique, Tibetan method, instinct and luck. But now I
find myself in need of something new. Which, for lack
of a better word, we will call magic.
Pause. Cooper looks at the door, at his watch. The suspects stand together, nervous,
uncertain.
Would you like us to hum? Perhaps some pagan chant ...
Truman and Albert move to Cooper.
I think it's going terrifically well, don't you?
Now what?
I'm not completely sure. Someone's missing.
Who?
Brian, the leprechaun king?
LIGHTNING AND THUNDER. Cooper looks at the suspects. He looks at his watch. He
peers at the large clock above the bar; it strikes three o'clock. Three soft resonant bongs.
A noise from the Roadhouse entrance, the door opens, light pours into the room. Cooper
pivots to see the familiar silhouette of MAJOR BRIGGS. Accompanied by the Room
Service Waiter.
Excuse us ...
#2.009.5d Revised 10-8-90, GREEN
Major, you're right on time.
I was on my way home. This kind gentleman flagged
me down, asked if I could drive him here.
Cooper and the Waiter look at each other. The Waiter winks at him. Gives him a thumbs up.
Takes out a pack of gum and extends the pack. Cooper takes out a stick. There's a lightning
bolt on the wrapper. Cooper puts the stick in his mouth. A FLASH OF LIGHTNING.
I know that gum. Thar's the kind I used to chew when I
was a kid. That's my favorite gum in the world.
That gum you like is going to come back in style.
Time stands still.
COOPER'S DREAM
Cooper is back in a dream. He looks down. On the roadhouse floor, a familiar mound of
dirt appears at his feet. Something gold gleams inside it: Laura's heart necklace. But the
heart is no longer halved, both pieces are joined. The heart shimmers, disappears:
Out of it the fabric of his vision tears, shifts. And Cooper finds himself back in a familiar red
room. The dream first seen in episode #1.002. Cooper sits in the armchair, mute. Laura leans
close to him, smiling. She whispers. But this time Cooper hears and comprehends ...
Ben Horne killed me.
A FLASH OF LIGHTNING.
We're back in the roadhouse. The GIANT appears holding Cooper's ring in the palm of his
hand. In the same brilliant flash of light, the Giant disappears and Cooper's ring falls out of
the air, bounces and rolls to a stop at Cooper's feet. He bends to pick it up. Slips it on his
finger. We MOVE in on him. A long beat. Then, quiet, stern, Cooper turns toward Ben
Horne.
Ben, I would like you to accompany me to the Sheriff's
station. You might want to bring Leland with you. As
your attorney.
Cooper nods to Truman. The Sheriff cuffs a stunned Ben Horne and leads him away. Deputy
Hawk steps to Cooper.
#2.009.5d Revised 10-8-90, GREEN
The quest is over?
One thing more.
Hawk leans to receive his whisper. Hawk walks to the door. Cooper follows at first and then
stops. He looks back towards the stage. He sees the Room Service Waiter wave at him and
smile.
EXT. GAZEBO - DAY
James rides up on his bike, hops off as Donna runs to him, hugs him, quietly hysterical.
Evidence recent rain all about them.
What is it? What's the matter?
Maddy ...
What about her?
She's dead. It was the killer. The one who killed
Laura. She's dead.
Stunned, he moves away. His legs give way near the shore. Donna watches him helplessly.
No ... no ...
I heard Mr. Palmer get a call from her, from her
mother, she said she hadn't gotten home, they came to
talk to him, Sheriff Truman and so I went home, my
father he was so upset he couldn't keep it from me ...
She starts to cry. They can't comfort each other.
We could've helped her.
How?
#2.009.4d
I don't know
(his anger startles them both; he suddenly sees a
gulf between them)
It's no good.
What do you mean?
You mean us?
We can't do this. It's no good.
What did we do? What did we do?
Pause.
I've got to go. I've got to go.
He starts for his bike.
James, don't leave ... it's not our fault!
It doesn't matter. Don't you see? Nothing we do
matters. Nothing's ever going to change. It doesn't
matter if we're happy when the rest of the world goes to
hell -
Don't leave - James - don't leave me alone!
He gets on his bike and rides. Anguished, Donna turns toward the lake, weeping, stepping
slowly into the water.

EXT. SHERIFF'S STATION - DAY
Establish.
INT. SHERIFF'S STATION - DAY
RICHARD TREMAYNE enters the station. Waiting by the door to the conference room,
Lucy spots him, directs him towards the conference room. She gestures silence, Tremayne
complies.
21A. INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
Tremayne enters to discover Andy sitting at one end of the table. Tremayne sits opposite
him. Lucy moves to a seat halfway between them. They all look at each other. High Noon.
21B. INT. SHERIFF'S STATION - DAY
Doors swing open. Hawk leads Ben in. Leland, Cooper, and Truman follow.
Let's take him back down to interrogation.
Hawk leads Ben off. Truman follows.
Is he going to be charged?
Yes.
I'd like to begin bail proceedings as soon as possible.
#2.009.5d Revised 10-8-90, GREEN
21B. CONTINUED:
He'll have his day in court.
Cooper moves off. Leland follows.
INT. DOWNSTAIRS CORRIDOR - DAY
In the basement, around the corner from interrogation. Hawk leads Ben towards the door, as
Truman moves ahead to unlock it. Cooper and Leland follow them around the corner.
Truman unlocks the door, swings it open. Hawk grabs Ben from behind, moves him
forcefully into interrogation.
The moment Ben realizes he is locked in, he begins to howl like a caged wolf. Truman slams
the door shut, Hawk locks it.
The howling continues, a rabid sound; Ben, or rather "Bob", careens around the room,
pounding on the walls, searching for an escape that doesn't exist, his incoherent cries echoing
like the tortures of the damned.
Leland stands by, stunned, speechless.
... Ben? ...
That's not Ben.
A gesture from Cooper and Hawk leads Leland back around the corner.
How did you know?
Laura told me. In my dream.
Coop, I'm going to need slightly stronger evidence -
#2.009.5d Revised 10-8-90, GREEN
How about a confession?
22A. INT. INTERROGATION - DAY
Truman, Hawk, Albert and Cooper face Ben, sitting in a chair, handcuffs in front of him..
- you have the right to an attorney. If you cannot afford
an attorney one will be appointed for you ...
Ben begins to laugh, a low, feral sound, snarling and contemptuous.
Do you understand your rights as we've explained them
to you?
Of course he does.
I suppose you want to ask him some questions.
Did you kill Laura Palmer?
Ben hoots and howls. Then ...
That's a yes.
Did you kill Madeleine Ferguson?
What do you think?
I'm asking you.
Yeah, well, I guess I sort'a did, kind'a. I have a thing
for knives ...
... kind of like that time in Pittsburgh, huh Cooper?
#2.009.5d Revised 10-8-90, GREEN
22A. CONTINUED:
Cooper pales.
Ben's been a good vehicle. I've enjoyed the ride. But
he's weak now and riddled with holes. It's nearly time
to shuffle off to Buffalo.
Does Ben know what you've done?
Ben's a babe in the woods. With a large hole where his
conscience used to be. And when I go, children, I'll pull
the ripcord and you watch Ben remember. But not for
long ...
He laughs again wildly then stops with a jerk. His eyes close. "Bob" seems to be resting or
waiting. Truman and Cooper look at each other.
That's good enough for me.
The group exits the room quietly.
INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
Lucy faces both Tremayne and Andy. Tremayne reaches nervously for a cigarette.
Here's how this is going to work. I'm going to keep my
baby.
Oh?
That's not open for discussion.
I see.
Be quiet. Let her talk.
'Got a light?
Andy fishes for a match, then realizes he doesn't carry them.
#2.009.5d
.
No.
Tremayne lights his cigarette with a lighter, speaks to Lucy.
You were saying ...
There's only one way to handle this. They have a test to
determine the blood type of the father. It could be you
or it could be you.
Tremayne looks Andy up and down.
They won't be doing that test until the baby is born.
During which time I expect complete cooperation from
you two "gentlemen."
Whatever you say, Lucy. I mean, it's your baby.
Thank you.
The smoke from Tremayne's cigarette drifts lazily up to the ceiling. Towards the newly
installed smoke detector.
23A. INT. CORRIDOR - DAY
Hawk continues to monitor Ben thru the window. Cooper speaks urgently. Takes a piece of
paper from his pocket hands it to Truman.
Ben Horne's blood test.
#2.009.5d Revised 10-8-90, GREEN
23A. CONTINUED:
Why? Why did he kill her?
Laura wrote about Bob in her diary; Ben found it, ripped
out the pages and she knew he was onto her. Ben placed
that call to Laura from Ben's office the night she died.
He was the Third man outside Jacques' cabin. He took
both girls to the train car. It was his blood we found,
not Ben Horne's.
Then why kill Maddy?
She reminded him of Laura. Maddy was going home,
maybe he couldn't bear to part with her. He wanted to
relive the experience. Or maybe she realized Bob was
the killer and he found out.
But there can't really be a "Bob." I mean Ben's just
crazy Isn't he?
Truman, Hawk, Cooper and Albert look at each other. Ben's howls fill the air.
Shall we take a vote?
From inside the room they hear Ben's voice.
Ben'S VOICE
"In the darkness of futures past/The Magician longs to
see/One chants out between two worlds/Fire, walk with
me.
24A. OMITTED
#2.009.5c
24B. A SMOKE DETECTOR
Smoke curling into its curves.
INT. INTERROGATION - DAY
Ben rises in his chair as he continues reciting.
"I'll catch you with my death bag/You may think I've
gone insane/But I promise I will kill again."
As it climaxes, the electronic wail of a smoke alarm is heard.
26A. INT. CORRIDOR - DAY
Cooper and the others look up; he's directly under the nozzle of a sprinkler head. The
sprinkler heads spit water and start to rain. The corridor is filled with rain.
26B. INT. INTERROGATION ROOM DAY
With a terrifying, howl Ben/Bob bolts up from his seat and howls at the rain. Then he rushes
for the door ramming his head into it. He's knocked senseless, blood coming from a gash on
his head.
The foursome sprint into the room. Cooper rushes to Ben, wet and still on the ground,
water continuing to fall in this room.
Call an ambulance.
Hawk rushes out of the room. Cooper gathers Ben in his arms. Truman, Albert stand by.
Ben? ... Ben? ... Ben?
That smell.
Burnt engine oil.
#2.009.5d
26B. CONTINUED:
Ben's eyes flutter open. It's Ben. Bob is gone. And Ben is dying.
Where ... where am I?
You're here. Lie still.
Ben spasms, a seizure gripping him. Albert helps Cooper restrain him, pulling his tongue
from down his throat. It subsides. Ben moans, as his eyes reopen.
The shadow ... he's gone ... I ... I remember ...
Oh, my God ... Laura ...
I killed her ... oh my God, I killed her ... I didn't
know, I didn't know ... Laura, darling, forgive me ...
It's all right. It's all right.
I was just a little boy. I saw him in my dreams. He
said he wanted to play ...
... and he opened me ... and I invited him ... and he came
inside me ...
COOPER.
He went inside.
When he was in me, I didn't know ... when he was gone, I
couldn't remember ... he made me do things ... terrible
things ... he wanted life ... he wanted others, others they
could use, the way they used me ...
Laura?
They wanted Laura ... they wanted her, but she was strong
... she fought them, she wouldn't let them in ... they
made me kill that girl, Theresa, they said if I didn't
give Laura to them they'd make me kill her too ...
#2.009.5c
26B. CONTINUED:(2)
"They?"
Tears are streaming down Truman's face as he listens. Albert is anguished. Cooper
presses on.
But she wouldn't give in.
She said she'd die before she'd let them ... they made
me kill her ... God have mercy on me, what have I done?
What have I done? I love her ... I loved her with all my
heart ...
Be quiet now. Lie quiet.
Laura, forgive me ... ...
Ben is fading. Albert checks him out, looks at Cooper, shakes his head. Cooper turns BEN
gently so that he's lying on his right side, holds him and begins to speak softly in his ear. The
Tibetan Book of the Dead.
Ben, the time has come for you to seek the Path. Your
soul has set you face to face before the clear light ... and
now you are about to experience it in its Reality, wherein
all things are like the void and cloudless sky, and the
naked, spotless intellect is like a transparent vaccum,
without circumference or center ...
Ben's face calms. His eyes clear. Albert and Truman watch, electrified.
At this moment, know yourself and abide in that state ...
Look towards the light, Ben, look towards the light.
I see it ...
Move towards it now ... into the light ... into the light ...
into the light ...
#2.009.5c
26B. CONTINUED:(3)
I see her ... she's there ...
Into the light ... into the light ...
She's beautiful ...
Into the light...
Laura.
He dies. Cooper looks up at Albert and Truman. Truman dries the tears in his eyes. Cooper
closes Ben's eyes. Above them, water stops flowing from the sprinklers.
EXT. WOODS - DAY
A short time later. Truman, Cooper and Albert step through the pines. As if to seek refuge in
the rain-fresh air. Major Briggs is standing in a clearing.
He was insane. Schizophrenic. Gerard too.
Was he?
What's the alternative? Ghosts and goblins?
An elemental spirit?
Gentlemen, there is more in heaven and earth than is
dreamt of in our philosophy.
Amen.
People saw him. People saw Bob. Laura. Maddy.
Sarah Palmer.
Then how did Ronette see him in the train car?
#2.009.5c
Maybe the head injury. The trauma opened some kind
of perceptual window ...
How did you see him?
That question may require a bit more self-examination.
I've lived in these woods all my life. I've heard some
strange things. Seen some too. But this is way off the
map. I'm having a hard time believing.
Is it easier to believe a man would rape and murder his
own daughter? Is that any more comforting?
No.
An evil that great in this beautiful world. Finally, does
it matter what the cause?
Yes. Because it's our job to stop it.
Briggs thinks, agrees, nods.
Maybe that's all "Bob" is. The evil that men do.
Maybe it doesn't matter what we call it.
Pause. No one seems to disagree.
Well. There's another thing that bothers me.
They look to him.
If he was real. If he was here and we had him, trapped,
and he got away ... where is Bob now?
#2.009.5c
They look at each other. No one has the answer.
EXT. WOODS - NIGHT
The wind blows fiercely. We move through the woods, slowly at first, then gathering speed.
We stop in a clearing. the wind stops, abruptly. We hear something moving through the
underbrush.
Flying, into frame, full face, screeching in an unearthly high pitch.
