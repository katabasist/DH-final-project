MATCH CUT TO: 2. SAME PHOTOS - LATER
MATCH CUT TO: SOUND of a door closing. Footsteps. EXPAND TO show WINDOM EARLE coming in
MATCH CUT TO: to see Briggs is gone.
MATCH CUT TO: Why, who in the world let Major Briggs loose, Leo? It
MATCH CUT TO: couldn't have been you, could it?
MATCH CUT TO: Leo cringes, expecting another shock. None comes.
MATCH CUT TO: No, no punishment little Leo. It's to late for that to
MATCH CUT TO: do us any harm. And I have a new game for you.
MATCH CUT TO: He holds up a burlap bag. Something's moving inside.
MATCH CUT TO: 3. INT. DINER - DAY
MATCH CUT TO: Over by the kitchen, SHELLY and ANNIE are sorting silverware, when they're joined by
MATCH CUT TO: NORMA, who carries over a tray of freshly baked pies.
MATCH CUT TO: Here's our contribution to the Miss Twin Peaks Gala
MATCH CUT TO: Buffet. And I fully expect to see one of you up there
MATCH CUT TO: tonight in the winner's circle.
MATCH CUT TO: Dream on, Norma.
MATCH CUT TO: #2.021
MATCH CUT TO: 3. CONTINUED:
MATCH CUT TO: Don't sell yourself short, kid. This is one of the biggest
MATCH CUT TO: days of the year for us and we need somebody up there
MATCH CUT TO: who deserves that title. Especially this year.
MATCH CUT TO: ... Laura Palmer.
MATCH CUT TO: A day of healing and coming together.
MATCH CUT TO: We could use more than a day.
MATCH CUT TO: Norma, is it true they're going to honor you tonight?
MATCH CUT TO: Twentieth anniversary of when you won?
MATCH CUT TO: Hush.
MATCH CUT TO: If you entered you could win today.
MATCH CUT TO: Listen to her, working on the judge already.
MATCH CUT TO: Since you brought it up ...
MATCH CUT TO: Good question: who are you going to vote for?
MATCH CUT TO: Ahelly and Annie put an arm around each other and present a united front.
MATCH CUT TO: Maybe they'll let you split your vote.
MATCH CUT TO: We have a customer.
MATCH CUT TO: ANGLE ON DALE COOPER entering the diner. It's clear whose customer he is: to
MATCH CUT TO: Shelly's intrigued glance, Annie walks over toward the counter.
MATCH CUT TO: Looks like a staff meeting of the Double R brain trust.
MATCH CUT TO: We're trying to decide who's going to win tonight.
MATCH CUT TO: #2.021
MATCH CUT TO: 3. CONTINUED:
MATCH CUT TO: No question about it. You are.
MATCH CUT TO: You're not exactly objective -
MATCH CUT TO: I am completely objective.
MATCH CUT TO: I think you're not as objective as you think you are.
MATCH CUT TO: Perhaps that's why it seems so important to me that we
MATCH CUT TO: kiss.
MATCH CUT TO: You impetuous boy. We have an audience.
MATCH CUT TO: I know this violates multiple laws of physics, but at his
MATCH CUT TO: moment, Annie, and I mean this quite literally... you are
MATCH CUT TO: the only person in the room.
MATCH CUT TO: Annie beams. They lean across the counter to kiss. Shelly and Norma look on, smile, look
MATCH CUT TO: away.
MATCH CUT TO: 4. INT. GREAT NORTHERN - DAY
MATCH CUT TO: AUDREY HORNE stands pensively, her face half-lit by the fireplace glow. BEN HORNE
MATCH CUT TO: enters, arms filled with books they nearly obscure him. Audrey manages a smile.
MATCH CUT TO: Hi, Daddy.
MATCH CUT TO: (pausing by the fire, nearly losing hold of a
MATCH CUT TO: tome)
MATCH CUT TO: Audrey. The most intelligent face I've seen all day. You
MATCH CUT TO: make the rest of us look like primates.
MATCH CUT TO: What's with all the books?
MATCH CUT TO: #2.021
MATCH CUT TO: 4. CONTINUED:
MATCH CUT TO: The Koran, the Bhagavad-Gita, the Talmud, the Bible,
MATCH CUT TO: New and Old Testaments, the Tao-te-ching ... I have in
MATCH CUT TO: my arms those holy books that constitute the fundamental
MATCH CUT TO: framework of man's philosophies of good. Somewhere in
MATCH CUT TO: here are the answers I seek. I intend to read them, cover
MATCH CUT TO: to cover until find ...
MATCH CUT TO: Audrey's attention has wandered back to the fire. Ben Finally stops rambling, sees the sad
MATCH CUT TO: expression on her face.
MATCH CUT TO: Listen to me, prattling on. It's Jack, isn't it?
MATCH CUT TO: He's only been gone a day. I ask myself how much will it
MATCH CUT TO: hurt next week?
MATCH CUT TO: Let me give you a piece of ageless wisdom culled from
MATCH CUT TO: these volumes: time heals all wounds.
MATCH CUT TO: I know what it feels like. Believe me, I know. He'll be
MATCH CUT TO: back.
MATCH CUT TO: We barely had time to realize how we felt ...
MATCH CUT TO: But what you had was highly concentrated.
MATCH CUT TO: It's the concentrate they make concentrate from.
MATCH CUT TO: I'm afraid I'll never see him again.
MATCH CUT TO: Jack's a man of his word. If he said he'll be back, he'll be
MATCH CUT TO: back, I promise you.
MATCH CUT TO: You can't promise. But thanks for wanting to. I actually
MATCH CUT TO: came in here to update you on my Seattle trip.
MATCH CUT TO: Update away.

MATCH CUT TO: 4. CONTINUED:
MATCH CUT TO: The Packards are using Twin Peaks Savings and Loan to
MATCH CUT TO: funnel cash for the Ghostwood Project, but the bank's
MATCH CUT TO: keeping a very low profile. They don't want the bad
MATCH CUT TO: publicity.
MATCH CUT TO: Bad publicity is exactly what they're going to get.
MATCH CUT TO: Audrey, have you given any more thought to the Miss
MATCH CUT TO: Twin Peaks pageant?
MATCH CUT TO: Daddy, from the bottom of my heart, I don't want to be
MATCH CUT TO: the town bathing beauty.
MATCH CUT TO: Audrey, Miss Twin Peaks is the ultimate local forum. It
MATCH CUT TO: would be truly inspirational to have a winner with a
MATCH CUT TO: political sensibility that extends beyond makeup
MATCH CUT TO: strategies and recipes for cherry pie.
MATCH CUT TO: And as you know, each contestant makes a speech to the
MATCH CUT TO: asembled town. This year's theme concerns our
MATCH CUT TO: immediate environment. And what we must do to
MATCH CUT TO: preserve it.
MATCH CUT TO: HOLD ON Audrey for a beat. Considering brand new strategies.
MATCH CUT TO: Maybe I'd better take a look through those books myself.
MATCH CUT TO: 5. INT. SHERIFF'S STATION - CONFERENCE ROOM
MATCH CUT TO: START ON the cave painting reproduced on the blackboard: a cluttered concentration of
MATCH CUT TO: various symbols, stick figures, stars, hieroglyphs. PULL BACK to ANDY BRENNAN
MATCH CUT TO: standing myopically close to this drawing, staring at it with his own personal brand of awe.
MATCH CUT TO: Cooper and TRUMAN, looking sleepless, re-enter the room carrying their coffees.
MATCH CUT TO: Has he taken his eyes off it yet?
MATCH CUT TO: Not today.
MATCH CUT TO: We've still got people out combing the forest for Major
MATCH CUT TO: Briggs.
MATCH CUT TO: #2.021
MATCH CUT TO: 5. CONTINUED:
MATCH CUT TO: Harry, given their mutual connection to the Blue Book
MATCH CUT TO: Project, I'm afraid Earle may have targeted the Major.
MATCH CUT TO: For what?
MATCH CUT TO: Interesting.
MATCH CUT TO: They look over at Andy, who is still completely engrossed in the painting. Cooper and
MATCH CUT TO: Truman are in proximity to the bonsai tree.
MATCH CUT TO: I don't know yet. All of this appears to be flowing
MATCH CUT TO: together. Earle's been seeking access to the Black Lodge
MATCH CUT TO: as far back as 1965. This chess game may involve more
MATCH CUT TO: pieces than we'd begun to imagine. And then there's the
MATCH CUT TO: peculiar circumstances of Josie's death to consider.
MATCH CUT TO: Consider them how?
MATCH CUT TO: When Josie died ... I'm sorry I haven't mentioned this
MATCH CUT TO: before, Harry, but I had to take into account your mental
MATCH CUT TO: state -
MATCH CUT TO: What is it?
MATCH CUT TO: She was trembling with fear. Quaking, like an animal. I
MATCH CUT TO: might even venture a guess to say that it was fear that
MATCH CUT TO: killed her. And in the moment of her death ... I saw Bob.
MATCH CUT TO: As if he'd slipped in through a crevice in time. Upon
MATCH CUT TO: reflection, I believe there's a connection between his
MATCH CUT TO: appearance and Josie's fear. He was attracted by it. He
MATCH CUT TO: may even feed off it.
MATCH CUT TO: You see any connection between Bob and the Black Lodge?
MATCH CUT TO: I think it's where he comes from. I believe the Black
MATCH CUT TO: Lodge is the source of what you've traditionally referred
MATCH CUT TO: to here as the evil in the woods. If that's what Earle is
MATCH CUT TO: seeking, it's imperative that we find our way in before he
MATCH CUT TO: does. There's a source of power in that place far beyond
MATCH CUT TO: our ability to comprehend.

MATCH CUT TO: 6. INT. WINDOM EARLE'S CABIN
MATCH CUT TO: Windom Earle, listening in on his shortwave set, springs out of his chair in excitement.
MATCH CUT TO: Eureka! Dale, I could kiss your pointy little head. It's
MATCH CUT TO: fear! It's fear, Leo, that's the key!
MATCH CUT TO: My favorite emotional state and all this time it's been
MATCH CUT TO: staring me in the kisser. Leo, it's marvelous, a
MATCH CUT TO: perfect fit. These night creatures that hover on the edge of
MATCH CUT TO: our nightmares are drawn to us when we radiate fear, it's
MATCH CUT TO: their bread and butter, a perfect symbiosis. And to gain
MATCH CUT TO: entrance to their realm, a simple offering, the suffering of
MATCH CUT TO: innocence, Oh, nature, perfect in design and aspect, you
MATCH CUT TO: do not disappoint. Leo, look lively, victory is at hand.
MATCH CUT TO: We know where the entrance is. We know when the lock
MATCH CUT TO: appears and now we hold the key in our hands.
MATCH CUT TO: He takes the photos down and packs them, then closes the suitcase. He lifts the other case.
MATCH CUT TO: Forgive my hasty departure, dear one. But the time has
MATCH CUT TO: come to gather my beloved Queen and embark upon our
MATCH CUT TO: dark honeymoon. I haven't been this excited since I
MATCH CUT TO: punctured Caroline's aorta.
MATCH CUT TO: Leo, we must share a final sentiment ...
MATCH CUT TO: We still cannot see Leo.
MATCH CUT TO: During our time together in this verdant bower, I must
MATCH CUT TO: confess I've developed something of a fondness for you.
MATCH CUT TO: Sounding board, companion. Ever obedient and faithful.
MATCH CUT TO: An all-around "A" for effort, Leo. Though I'm still a
MATCH CUT TO: trifle miffed at your release of Major Briggs. But then
MATCH CUT TO: You'll have plenty of time to reflect upon that, won't you?
MATCH CUT TO: Goodbye, Leo. And good luck.
MATCH CUT TO: As he goes, we PAN DOWN to Leo, who is very tightly shackled. He is holding the end of a
MATCH CUT TO: string taut in his mouth. We FOLLOW the string directly above his head and see that it is
MATCH CUT TO: holding a large suspended plastic bag shut. Inside the bag are dozens of deadly spiders.

FADE OUT: 7. INT. ROADHOUSE - DAY
FADE OUT: A line of Miss Twin Peaks contestants in black dance leotards rehearse the opening number.
FADE OUT: They include, amongst some faces we do not know, DONNA, Shelly, Annie, LUCY,
FADE OUT: Audrey, NADINE and LANA. Standing before them, sleeves up, a cigarette bobbing in his
FADE OUT: mouth, is the impresario and choreographer, the ubiquitous TIM PINKLE. The piano player,
FADE OUT: TRUDY, jumps back into a show tune and the girls begin their chorus line dance.
FADE OUT: Okay, one and two.. and three...
FADE OUT: Step forward one and over and two....
FADE OUT: The girls continue on their own as Pinkle steps over to a table and takes a large pull off his
FADE OUT: submarine sandwich.
FADE OUT: Let the mood carry you... don't be afraid to be
FADE OUT: vulnerable... and give me just a little more leg...
FADE OUT: Now bend forward, like sap in the... er, sapling in the
FADE OUT: wind... a little further... very good... hold it for me... then
FADE OUT: up... and out.
FADE OUT: The song ends. Audrey eyes their trainer warily.
FADE OUT: You girls'll need a lot of work...
FADE OUT: ...but if you stay with it, I think I can make dancers out of
FADE OUT: you.
FADE OUT: Especially you, Miss Horne.
FADE OUT: What kind of dance was this, Mr. Pinkle?
FADE OUT: A nature dance, my little friend. A celebration.
FADE OUT: What are we celebrating when you have us all bending
FADE OUT: over?
FADE OUT: Don't question the vision of your choreographer. You're
FADE OUT: but a petal on the rose.

FADE OUT: Later it'll be the pistils and the stamens.
FADE OUT: Pistils and what?
FADE OUT: Don't ask.
FADE OUT: We're on stage at last. That's all that matters.
FADE OUT: This is the weirdest thing I have ever seen.
FADE OUT: I think it't just the greatest thing that ever happened.
FADE OUT: Once more with feeling, girls. I only have three things to
FADE OUT: say: energy, energy, energy.
FADE OUT: ANGLE OFF them over to a booth where the three judges, Norma, TREMAYNE, and
FADE OUT: Milford sit watching, and discussing.
FADE OUT: If talent's to be any part of our deliberations, we'd best
FADE OUT: close our eyes until Pinkie's done wrecking havoc.
FADE OUT: I love a chorus line.
FADE OUT: If we can focus here for a second, I have to get back to the
FADE OUT: diner:
FADE OUT: "What qualities do we think best examplify Miss Twin
FADE OUT: Peaks?"
FADE OUT: Beauty and power.
FADE OUT: That's how I like 'em.
FADE OUT: #2.021
FADE OUT: 7. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: Poise. And... God help us... sophistication and breeding.
FADE OUT: I think a major factor should be originality.
FADE OUT: Wouldn't that fall under talent?
FADE OUT: Always nice when it does.
FADE OUT: TREMAYNE.
FADE OUT: Personally, I've always been big on style.
FADE OUT: That should be enough to work with. I'll make up the
FADE OUT: score sheets this afternoon. I've really got to go.
FADE OUT: Terrific.
FADE OUT: She goes. Milford eyes Tremayne. Business time.
FADE OUT: Score sheets, shmore sheets. We're set on this, aren't we
FADE OUT: Dick?
FADE OUT: Set on ... ?
FADE OUT: She looks lovely today, doesn't she?
FADE OUT: If looks could kill ...
FADE OUT: Sorry Insensitive of me.
FADE OUT: She'd make a great Miss Twin Peaks.
FADE OUT: Wouldn't she just. But my vote is of course something I
FADE OUT: hold sacred and will exercise with the greatest care and
FADE OUT: consideration. As you well know, being a man who's been

FADE OUT: Hello, Dick. We're on break.
FADE OUT: H-hi, Lana.
FADE OUT: Do you think you could help me find something in the

FADE OUT: The storage room.
FADE OUT: We're missing a very important prop.
FADE OUT: The Mayor signals his approval to Lana.

FADE OUT: All light comes from the hall. Two silhouettes enter. She shuts the door, closing them into
FADE OUT: DARKNESS.
FADE OUT: I'm having trouble.
FADE OUT: Just flick it.
FADE OUT: A moment. His flashlight goes on. Its light nervously scans the little room.
FADE OUT: Now, what exactly did you need to find?
FADE OUT: The flashlight goes off
FADE OUT: Lana?...

FADE OUT: 8. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: Oh, did I do that?
FADE OUT: The flashlight goes back on.
FADE OUT: What are we looking for?
FADE OUT: I don't know the exact, technical name for it..
FADE OUT: Well, does anything in here look like it ...
FADE OUT: The flashlight goes off.
FADE OUT: I think this might be it.
FADE OUT: Oh. By George, I think you've got it.
FADE OUT: 10. INT. GREAT NORTHERN/COOPER'S ROOM - DAY
FADE OUT: Cooper sits crosslegged on the floor, perfectly still, eyes closed: he is deep in meditation.
FADE OUT: Slowly he opens his eyes. Holds for a moment, takes a deep breath. Smiles broadly. Still
FADE OUT: crosslegged, he reaches over and flips on his tape recorder.
FADE OUT: Diane, it's 1:15 PM. I've just concluded my second
FADE OUT: meditations of the day in lieu of sleep. I am completely
FADE OUT: refreshed and struck again by the realization that we all
FADE OUT: live at a fraction of our potential. We've been working
FADE OUT: round the clock on the cave hieroglyph. I know the
FADE OUT: answer is in that crude etching and I am now convinced
FADE OUT: that Windom Earle is searching for the same thing we are,
FADE OUT: and for diametrically opposite reasons. If I'm correct in
FADE OUT: my assumptions about the power of that unholy place ...
FADE OUT: God help us if he gets there first.
FADE OUT: Cooper pauses, clearly shaken by the implication. Then, quietly:
FADE OUT: I want to make specific mention of Annie Blackburne.
FADE OUT: Diane, she is a completely original human being. Her
FADE OUT: #2.021
FADE OUT: 10. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: responses are as pure as a child's. To be honest, I haven't
FADE OUT: felt this way about anyone since Caroline. It's taken
FADE OUT: meeting someone like Annie to realize how gray my life
FADE OUT: has been since Caroline's death, how cold and solitary -
FADE OUT: A knock on the door. Cooper rises to answer it.
FADE OUT: Although occasionally there is something to be said for
FADE OUT: solitude.
FADE OUT: He flips off the recorder, opens the door. Annie stands before him. He admits her.
FADE OUT: You have nearly perfect timing.
FADE OUT: That's not what our choreographer says.
FADE OUT: What can I do for you, Annie?
FADE OUT: I have to give a speech in six hours. I haven't written a
FADE OUT: word and I don't have a thought in my hand. I am in a
FADE OUT: complete, sweaty-palmed panic and I needed to talk to
FADE OUT: someone, namely you.
FADE OUT: What's the topic?
FADE OUT: "What You Can Do to Save Our Local Forests." So what
FADE OUT: am I supposed to do, stand up there like a deranged
FADE OUT: Barbie Doll, "make sure you're campfires are completely
FADE OUT: out, kind of like my brain."
FADE OUT: You're I terrified of public speaking.
FADE OUT: Yes.
FADE OUT: Our forests need saving because of the way people regard
FADE OUT: them.
FADE OUT: #2.021
FADE OUT: 10. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: Expendable.
FADE OUT: If the Ghostwood development were going to cost
FADE OUT: thousands of lives, would it have even the slightest chance
FADE OUT: of going forward?
FADE OUT: Trees aren't the same as people ...
FADE OUT: But they're alive.
FADE OUT: Your forest ... is beautiful and very peaceful.
FADE OUT: Part of it's been damaged. I've tried to replant, but
FADE OUT: nothing's taken root ...
FADE OUT: They kiss. Tentatively at first. Then with greater fervor.
FADE OUT: Let's not talk anymore about trees.
FADE OUT: To be honest, that's not really why I'm here. The speech.
FADE OUT: The way I feel transcends metaphor. Obliterates it.
FADE OUT: How do you feel? I mean, usually. I only ask because ...
FADE OUT: well, actually, I want to know.
FADE OUT: My habit is to construct and control my emotions with
FADE OUT: great precision. Everything ordered and in its place.
FADE OUT: What I am feeling now has steamrollered every barrier
FADE OUT: I've ever, if you'll excuse the expression, erected. I don't
FADE OUT: know what I know or don't know. I only know ...
FADE OUT: I want to make love with you, Annie. That's all I know.
FADE OUT: Good.

FADE OUT: Do you feel the same...?
FADE OUT: Annie begins to unbutton her blouse. A gentle ritual.
FADE OUT: I am eager ... and full of grace.
FADE OUT: That's good enough for me.
FADE OUT: Cooper reaches for her. HOLD ON Annie and Cooper for a long beat. As they begin to
FADE OUT: make love.
FADE OUT: 9. INT. HURLEY HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY
FADE OUT: START ON a standing screen in the dark living room of the Hurley house. Slides projected
FADE OUT: upon it. just now: Nadine in wrestling garb, slamming some hapless opponent to the mat.
FADE OUT: NADINE'S VOICE
FADE OUT: ... and this is me with last year's regional champion from
FADE OUT: Yakima. He was cute. But a little slow. Next!
FADE OUT: The slide changes. Nadine now appears atop a dazed opponent, a referee counts beside them,
FADE OUT: about to slam his hand on the to mat to signal "pin".
FADE OUT: NADINE seated, peers proudly at the screen. MIKE, ED, and Norma are arrayed on the
FADE OUT: couch behind her. All equally uncomfortable, but determined to play along. DR. JACOBY
FADE OUT: runs the slide projector. Nadine continues, blissfully unaware:
FADE OUT: And this is me with Brock Farmington, Triple A
FADE OUT: champion from Spokane. Unbeaten in eighty previous
FADE OUT: matches, superior upper body strength, thighs like bridge
FADE OUT: supports...
FADE OUT: I pinned him in a minute five. Next!
FADE OUT: One last slide. Nadine with an armful of trophies.
FADE OUT: And this is me with all the stuff I won.
FADE OUT: Nadine turns to the couch, beams, curtsies. Ed leads the others in polite applause.

FADE OUT: 9. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: Congratulations, Nadine.
FADE OUT: Way to go, babe!
FADE OUT: Nadine leaps upon the couch next to Mike, gives him a big kiss. She takes his hand, holds it
FADE OUT: close to her breast. Jacoby turns on the lights, addresses the resulting foursome.
FADE OUT: Thank you, Nadine. You're probably wondering why
FADE OUT: we're gathered here today. I have found that when a
FADE OUT: couple contemplates divor -
FADE OUT: - er, breaking up, it is sometimes easier to talk about our
FADE OUT: feelings in the company of others. Nadine, maybe you
FADE OUT: would like to begin.
FADE OUT: Okay. Uhm. I guess it all started when I noticed Mike's
FADE OUT: buns in the hall at school.
FADE OUT: And... how are you feeling now?
FADE OUT: Well. A little guilty, I guess. I mean Mike and I are
FADE OUT: hot. Miss Twin Peaks is tonight and Mr. Pinkle thinks
FADE OUT: I'm a show business natural. I mean because I'm so happy.
FADE OUT: I worry about Ed being sad.
FADE OUT: Ed, are you sad?
FADE OUT: No.
FADE OUT: Nadine. How does that make you feel?
FADE OUT: It makes me feel like maybe it's time for us to get on
FADE OUT: with our lives the best way we know how. And leave the
FADE OUT: past behind us.
FADE OUT: It's a startlingly clear-headed pronouncement. Nadine gives Mike's hand a brief, affirming

FADE OUT: kiss. Jacoby nods approval. He turns to Ed, prods:
FADE OUT: Ed? Do you have something you would like to tell
FADE OUT: Nadine?
FADE OUT: Nadine. Norma and I are planning to get married.
FADE OUT: A beat. All regard Nadine. Wait for her reaction. Finally:
FADE OUT: Really? That's wonderful, Eddie. 'Cause Mike and me
FADE OUT: are getting married too.
FADE OUT: That's news to Mike. Nadine squeezes his hand with superhuman strength. Mike's mouth opens
FADE OUT: in a silent scream. Then he flat out HOWLS.

FADE OUT: HAWK drives a country road. SHOT ROTATES away from him until we look out the
FADE OUT: windshield, where SUDDENLY.
FADE OUT: A MAN steps out into the road, groping, arms extended skyward; he has no sense he's
FADE OUT: stepping out in front of a vehicle. As Hawk CAREENS and SLAMS on the BRAKES, he

FADE OUT: I waited for you.
FADE OUT: Thanks, Harry.
FADE OUT: Not that he's too talkative.
FADE OUT: A beat on Briggs.
FADE OUT: He checks out okay physically. Doc ran a blood test ...
FADE OUT: He's been shot up with haloperidol.
FADE OUT: Right.
FADE OUT: Garland ... did Windom Earle do this to you?
FADE OUT: Garland. What an odd name ...
FADE OUT: Was it Windom Earle?
FADE OUT: He was God, I suppose.
FADE OUT: Where did he take you?
FADE OUT: The woods?
FADE OUT: Can you be a little more specific?
FADE OUT: They were lovely, dark and deep.

FADE OUT: The King of Romania was unable to attend.
FADE OUT: Hopeless. Cooper and Truman pull away.
FADE OUT: This might take awhile.
FADE OUT: How much time have we got?
FADE OUT: Andy enters, and without a word, walks straight past Briggs and up to the cave painting.
FADE OUT: Not enough. Let's leave him in here with us. Maybe
FADE OUT: something will bubble up. Harry, we're in trouble. If the
FADE OUT: door to the Black Lodge does exist, it probably exists
FADE OUT: only in time. An object like a door normally exists at a
FADE OUT: point in space and time. By way of contrast, a shooting
FADE OUT: star exists for us at a point in time over a continuim in
FADE OUT: space, but looking at it from the star's point of view
FADE OUT: might be an entirely different experience.
FADE OUT: Sorry, you lost me.
FADE OUT: If we're not at the right place at exactly the right time
FADE OUT: we'll never find the way in.
FADE OUT: Sheriff?...
FADE OUT: They both look over at Andy, who remains fixated on the drawing.
FADE OUT: Could the 4H Club have anything to do with all this?
FADE OUT: Doubtful, Andy.
FADE OUT: Andy continues staring. Cooper stands.
FADE OUT: Harry, you'll have to excuse me. I left someone waiting
FADE OUT: in the other room.

FADE OUT: Cooper and Annie exit, taking slow steps out into the day.
FADE OUT: I'm sorry about this. I mean work. Having to be here
FADE OUT: instead of ... you know ...
FADE OUT: Guess this isn't a good day to fall in love.
FADE OUT: It's a great day. I'm just not used to feeling such discord
FADE OUT: between my professional and personal concerns.
FADE OUT: I'm not used to feeling what I feel right now either.
FADE OUT: Like a force of nature.
FADE OUT: I think I may have found the inspiration for my speech.
FADE OUT: I think we may have found a lot of things ...
FADE OUT: Don't say too much. You don't want to jinx us.
FADE OUT: No. I just don't want to lose you.
FADE OUT: Go back to work. My heart will start beating again when

FADE OUT: The room is spread with power tools, hand tools, gloves, soldering irons. PAN UP to a
FADE OUT: counter converted into a work bench, and on to a vice containing a small black box. Standing
FADE OUT: around the clamp are CATHERINE MARTELL, ANDREW PACKARD and PETE
FADE OUT: MARTELL.
FADE OUT: This has to be the last one. Look at it.
FADE OUT: I can't take any more of this. Boxes inside boxes...
FADE OUT: What's in there could be worth a fortune.
FADE OUT: Maybe it's not a box at all. Maybe it's just a block of
FADE OUT: stainless steel.
FADE OUT: Eckhardt's last little joke.
FADE OUT: Be a good one.
FADE OUT: Let's channel some of that high wit into the job.
FADE OUT: I just don't believe a little crumb like that can stand up to
FADE OUT: this Cram Jack All Duty Vise.
FADE OUT: Again?
FADE OUT: Again.
FADE OUT: Pete sits up on the counter, Andrew standing beside him. Pete locks his hands across the vise's
FADE OUT: leverage bar. Andrew leans against his brother-in-law, both hands pulling down on his
FADE OUT: shoulders.
FADE OUT: On three. One.. two... three.
FADE OUT: Pete paratroops down off the counter, with his whole body weight against the vise bar. Andrew
FADE OUT: yanks down on his shoulders, but one hand slips free, causing Pete's vise grip to loosen for an
FADE OUT: instant, sending both Pete and Andrew to the floor behind the counter. Andrew stands back up
FADE OUT: and yanks the box free of the vise and throws it to the floor in front of Catherine.
FADE OUT: #2.021 Revised 2-21-91, YELLOW
FADE OUT: 15. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: The infernal box. It's heinous. It is slowly driving me
FADE OUT: mad.
FADE OUT: Oh, good, Andrew, perhaps if you yell long and loud
FADE OUT: enough it will open by itself.
FADE OUT: Do you have any better ideas, Catherine?
FADE OUT: Pete pulls himself back up from behind the counter using the handle of the vise for balance. He
FADE OUT: comes back down on the vise, which slams shut against Andrew's hand.
FADE OUT: Packard SCREAMS.
FADE OUT: Sorry, Andrew.
FADE OUT: Pete loosens the vise, freeing Andrew's left hand. The man is in indescribable pain. He looks
FADE OUT: down at his hand. Pain instantly turns to rage. He pulls out a gun we didn't know he had.
FADE OUT: Pete's eyes bug out.
FADE OUT: What are you doing? He didn't mean it...
FADE OUT: Where's it?
FADE OUT: Where's what?
FADE OUT: There it is.
FADE OUT: The tiny box. Halfway across the room. Andrew fires. It flies. He fires again. And again.
FADE OUT: Andrew, no!!
FADE OUT: And again. And again. He puts the gun down.
FADE OUT: Damned boxes.
FADE OUT: Pete comes out from behind the counter and walks over to the far corner of the room, into
FADE OUT: which are lodged the box's remains.

FADE OUT: 22A.
FADE OUT: 15. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: Well, look at this.
FADE OUT: They come over. Three people are bending into a tiny comer. They rise. In Pete's hand is a
FADE OUT: key.
FADE OUT: A key.
FADE OUT: Where there's a key, there's a lock.
FADE OUT: This should be kept safe.
FADE OUT: And in plain sight.
FADE OUT: You two don't trust each other?
FADE OUT: A look at Pete. Then each other.
FADE OUT: Of course we do.
FADE OUT: #2.021
FADE OUT: 15. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: Like brother and sister.
FADE OUT: How about here.
FADE OUT: Under this bell jar. On the desk. In plain sight.
FADE OUT: Splendid.
FADE OUT: So ... we have a key.
FADE OUT: Yes. We do.
FADE OUT: She sits down beside the desk. Andrew sits on the other side of the desk. A beat. They'll
FADE OUT: wait each other out. Pete, watching all this, shakes his head and walks out.
FADE OUT: 16. INT. HAYWARD HOUSE - DAY
FADE OUT: Donna comes down the stairs in a black sequined gown, hair and makeup meticulously done.
FADE OUT: She enters the living room where Doc and EILEEN HAYWARD gaze at her proudly.
FADE OUT: You look truly beautiful.
FADE OUT: Read us your speech.
FADE OUT: But Donna's expression reveals a completely different agenda.
FADE OUT: Right now, I'd prefer to talk about the truth.
FADE OUT: What truth is there?
FADE OUT: Something is going on between you and Ben Home. I
FADE OUT: want to know what it is.
FADE OUT: Donna, don't talk to your mother that way -
FADE OUT: This isn't child-parent. This is eye-to-eye. I want to
FADE OUT: know. Now.
FADE OUT: #2.021
FADE OUT: 16. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: Donna, I understand your feelings. There are things you
FADE OUT: have to trust in. You're young and you don't see any
FADE OUT: limitations -
FADE OUT: I now the limitations of lies. I know you raised me to
FADE OUT: tell the truth. I expect the same from you.
FADE OUT: Pause. Eileen and Doc look at each other, agonized.
FADE OUT: If you won't tell me, I'll have to find out what I want
FADE OUT: from Ben Horne.
FADE OUT: No ...
FADE OUT: Then tell me.
FADE OUT: Silence. Eileen looks away.
FADE OUT: Understand. This is your choice, not mine. And you've
FADE OUT: made it.
FADE OUT: She heads for the door. Doc comes to his feet.
FADE OUT: Donna -
FADE OUT: But she is gone.
FADE OUT: 17. INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
FADE OUT: Deputy Andy brings fresh coffee into the conference room. He pauses to resume his
FADE OUT: contemplation of the cave painting on the blackboard. Andy sets down the coffee, moves even
FADE OUT: closer. Truman and Cooper confer nearby. Cooper has surrounded himself with various books
FADE OUT: and charts. He finds something.
FADE OUT: Andy, take a look at this: it's what you mistook for the
FADE OUT: 4H Club; the 4 and H are astrological symbols -
FADE OUT: You mean like planets?
FADE OUT: #2.021
FADE OUT: 17. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: Yes, they're the symbols for Jupiter and Saturn. Some of
FADE OUT: these other symbols are planetary as well. What this
FADE OUT: paticular part of the puzzle seems to signify is a specific
FADE OUT: planetary position: Jupiter and Saturn in conjunction.
FADE OUT: What's that supposed to mean?
FADE OUT: Historically, when Jupiter and Saturn are conjunct, large
FADE OUT: shifts occur in power and fortune. Jupiter is expansive in
FADE OUT: its influence; Saturn, contractive. Conjunction suggests a
FADE OUT: state of concentration, intensification. What we have
FADE OUT: indicated here is something potentially explosive.
FADE OUT: Taking into account the earth's rotation, planetary
FADE OUT: positions are specific down to the last second ...
FADE OUT: ... and according to the Ephemeris, taking the other
FADE OUT: planetary positions on the wall into account, this
FADE OUT: conjunction will occur in our part of the world ...
FADE OUT: His finger stops. Cooper looks up. Surprised, concerned.
FADE OUT: When?
FADE OUT: Tonight. At midnight.
FADE OUT: My God, Harry, the door to the Lodge, that's when it
FADE OUT: opens. That's what the puzzle's telling us.
FADE OUT: Protect ... the Queen ...
FADE OUT: If the door is open tonight then something else here must
FADE OUT: tell us where. We need to decipher the rest of this,
FADE OUT: immediately. Think, anything that looks familiar ...
FADE OUT: They look intently.
FADE OUT: Fear and love ... open the doors.
FADE OUT: What did he say?
FADE OUT: #2.021
FADE OUT: 17. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: He said "Fear and love open the doors."
FADE OUT: Two Lodges, two doors. Fear opens one, the Black.
FADE OUT: Love, the other.
FADE OUT: What does that mean?
FADE OUT: I don't know exactly. It just came to me.
FADE OUT: "How does the Queen?"
FADE OUT: Cooper and Truman exchange looks. Cooper's on a roll.
FADE OUT: Of course: the Queen.
FADE OUT: Romania?
FADE OUT: No. The chess game's final piece. Follow my thinking.
FADE OUT: Earle takes the Queen ...
FADE OUT: The game's not over until you take the King.
FADE OUT: That depends on where he takes her. Maybe he takes her to
FADE OUT: the doorway when it opens ...
FADE OUT: Which Queen are we talking about?
FADE OUT: Andy, as if psychically awakened by this climate of collective revelation, suddenly goes
FADE OUT: dumbstruck. For the first time, he looks away from the board, over at Cooper and Truman.
FADE OUT: Agent Cooper ...
FADE OUT: Not now, Andy. Tonight ... the Queen. But who? A
FADE OUT: Queen. A crown ...
FADE OUT: #2.021
FADE OUT: 17. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: Agent Cooper?
FADE OUT: Miss twin Peaks.
FADE OUT: Oh my God.
FADE OUT: The two of them spring from their seats.
FADE OUT: Agent Cooper, please -
FADE OUT: Andy comes over, crying to get their attention, and knocks over the Bonsai plant. Truman
FADE OUT: respectfully kneels to pick it up, and discovers...
FADE OUT: This plant... has a bug.
FADE OUT: He pulls out and holds up the electronic device.
FADE OUT: This Bonsai wasn't from Josie. It was from Earle.
FADE OUT: He's way ahead of us, Harry. And we've been working for
FADE OUT: Earle from the start. What time does that conest start?
FADE OUT: Any minute.
FADE OUT: We've got to hurry.
FADE OUT: They bolt for the door. Andy, ignored, calls after.
FADE OUT: Agent Cooper!!

FADE OUT: #2.021 Revised 2-14-91, PINK
FADE OUT: 18. INT. ROADHOUSE/STAGE - NIGHT
FADE OUT: BEGIN ON the exuberant, concentrated expression of Nadine as she lands to the downbeat.
FADE OUT: TRACKING SHOT of the other contestants, who all form a chorus line in their leotards and
FADE OUT: dancing pumps. A small band plays the opening number as we INTERCUT amongst the
FADE OUT: girls: Audrey's detachment, Shelly's enjoyment, Donna's preoccupation, Annie's awkwardness,
FADE OUT: Lana's sultriness, Lucy's disorientation, Nadine's hopefulness, and the enthusiastic, nameless
FADE OUT: faces of others. INTERCUT through the audience, showing the three judges, Norma,
FADE OUT: Tremayne and Milford, the troubled Doc Hayward, the inebriated Pinkle, then finally
FADE OUT: PANNING OVER to where the LOG LADY stands, watching.
FADE OUT: The number ends to generous applause. Doc Hayward pauses in the wings, staring at Donna,
FADE OUT: hoping garner her attention. But she stares ahead, will not meet his gaze. Hayward steps to
FADE OUT: the microphone. He's got a lot on his mind.
FADE OUT: Good evening, everyone. Hope you've all had a good
FADE OUT: holiday. And welcome to the Miss Twin Peaks Pageant,
FADE OUT: in which one of these lovely, talented young citizens will
FADE OUT: be crowned Miss Twin Peaks.
FADE OUT: Now, commencing the talent segment of the show is Lucy
FADE OUT: Moran.
FADE OUT: Lucy steps forward, to the piano intro of Off Broadway. She looks awkwardly into the
FADE OUT: audience, shrugs, then breaks into a jazz dance that is shockingly good. The stagelight narrows
FADE OUT: to enclose her.
FADE OUT: Backstage, BOBBY BRIGGS, tomorrow's superstar, wanders about in a loose-fitting suit
FADE OUT: scoping out the crowd for possible opportunity. Not much. At a distance, he sees the Log
FADE OUT: Lady and shakes his head.
FADE OUT: Strictly small-town.
FADE OUT: Turning his head in another direction, he then sees... the Log Lady. He quickly turns back to
FADE OUT: the prior spot: no one. Thoroughly confused, he marches on over to the second Log lady, who
FADE OUT: is standing off in a corner, working quietly and efficiently at a power junction box.
FADE OUT: Excuse me.. did you invite family to this thing?
FADE OUT: The question is met with a deep stare. Suddenly the Log Lady hefts her log, CRACKS Bobby
FADE OUT: across the head, knocking him over, and out. CLOSE ON the 'Log Lady' until we can see,
FADE OUT: behind her glasses, the eyes of Windom Earle.
FADE OUT: #2.021
FADE OUT: 19. STAGE - LATER
FADE OUT: Doc Hayward returning to the microphone.
FADE OUT: Our next entry is Lana Budding-Milford, who will
FADE OUT: perform a dance of..
FADE OUT: ... contortionistic Jazz exotica. Lana?
FADE OUT: Lana steps forward, to some recorded sensual Near East rhythms.
FADE OUT: 20. INT. ROADHOUSE ENTRANCE
FADE OUT: Cooper and Truman hurry into the Roadhouse. Already planning, eyes scanning the crowd for
FADE OUT: trouble.
FADE OUT: We're pulling in deputies from all over to surround the
FADE OUT: place. They should be here within the hour.
FADE OUT: It's essential that whoever wins this contest receive full
FADE OUT: police protection: 24-hour guard, house surveillance,
FADE OUT: everything.
FADE OUT: Soon as she's announced.
FADE OUT: Truman heads one way, Cooper the other. HOLD SHOT as Andy now arrives, frustrated.
FADE OUT: Agent Cooper...
FADE OUT: 21. STAGE
FADE OUT: ... as Lana swings into the beginning of some overpowering rhythm stretches.
INTERCUT: 
INTERCUT: 22. AUDIENCE REACTIONS
INTERCUT: Hawk and Andy stand in awe of this exhibition. Trying to follow Lana's movement, their
INTERCUT: heads slowly, simultaneously tip in opposite directions.
INTERCUT: In the judge's booth, Tremayne's mouth hangs open. Milford leans in close to him.
INTERCUT: #2.021
INTERCUT: 22. CONTINUED:
INTERCUT: That, my friend, is an artist.
INTERCUT: Tremayne is close to tears. PAN over to Norma, forehead in hand.
INTERCUT: 23. AUDIENCE - LATER
INTERCUT: Cooper moves carefully through the crowd, eyes right and left. Then he pauses, looks up. And
INTERCUT: spots a catwalk overhead. He pauses to wonder. Then turns his eyes back to the stage.
INTERCUT: 24. STAGE - LATER
INTERCUT: Audrey in the middle of her pageant theme speech.
INTERCUT: There is only one way to save a forest, an idea, or
INTERCUT: anything of value: and that is by refusing to stand by and
INTERCUT: watch it die. There is a law of nature which is more
INTERCUT: fundamental to life than the laws of man. And when
INTERCUT: something you care about is in danger, you must act to
INTERCUT: save it, or lose it forever.
INTERCUT: And that is what I, as Miss Twin Peaks or as Audrey
INTERCUT: Horne, intend to do.
INTERCUT: Applause.
INTERCUT: 25. BACKSTAGE
INTERCUT: Andy, continuing his search for Cooper, happens upon the still disguised Earle.
INTERCUT: Hello, Miss Log Lady.
INTERCUT: No reply. Earle is just hoping he'll go away.
INTERCUT: Have you or your log seen Agent Cooper? I've got to find
INTERCUT: him.
INTERCUT: No.
INTERCUT: What was that?
INTERCUT: Revised 2-22-91, CHERRY
INTERCUT: #2.021
INTERCUT: 25. CONTINUED:
INTERCUT: NO.
INTERCUT: Oh. Sorry. It's just that I've got to find Agent Cooper as
INTERCUT: soon as possible. Maybe you could ask your log to be
INTERCUT: extra, on guard ...
INTERCUT: The Log Lady/Earle stomps away. Andy looks after, puzzled, frustrated. Something's not
INTERCUT: quite right. He spots someone across the room.
INTERCUT: Agent Cooper.
INTERCUT: Andy races off. CAMERA REMAINS. And reveals what Andy just missed. A siren horn
INTERCUT: attached to the backstage wall, new wiring, a timing device. Carefully installed by Windom
INTERCUT: Earle.
INTERCUT: 26. STAGE - LATER
INTERCUT: Annie giving her speech.
INTERCUT: ... and to illustrate my point, I'd like to read these words
INTERCUT: from Chief Seattle, leader of the Suquamish tribe:
INTERCUT: "Your dead... are soon forgotten and never return. Our
INTERCUT: dead never forget the beautiful world that gave them
INTERCUT: being. They still love its verdant valleys, its murmuring
INTERCUT: rivers, its magnificent mountains, sequestered vales and
INTERCUT: verdant lined lakes and bay and even yearn in tender, fond
INTERCUT: affection over the lonely hearted living, and often return
INTERCUT: from the Happy Hunting Ground to visit, guide, console
INTERCUT: and comfort them."
INTERCUT: A hush has fallen over the crowd. She folds up her paper.
INTERCUT: 27. CUTAWAY - CATWALK
INTERCUT: Windom Earle, now undisguised, darts along the catwalk overhead. He attaches another device
INTERCUT: to a sandbag line, sets the timer. That's when Annie's voice catches his attention from below.
INTERCUT: Earle pauses, peers down at her with rapt expression.
INTERCUT: #2.021
INTERCUT: 28. BACK TO SCENE
INTERCUT: Why have we all lost touch with this beauty? We tell
INTERCUT: ourselves the world is not alive so that we won't feel its
INTERCUT: pain. But instead we feel it all the more. Maybe saving a
INTERCUT: forest starts with preserving the little feelings that die
INTERCUT: inside us every day. Those parts of ourselves we deny.
INTERCUT: Because if that interior land is not honored, then neither
INTERCUT: will we honor the land we walk. Thank you very much.
INTERCUT: She walks off to a salvo of applause. INTERCUT to show Cooper, who has been conferring
INTERCUT: with a deputy, pausing to watch her exit with evident emotion. And Tremayne, who looks
INTERCUT: swept away, and finally ... Windom Earle, in the catwalks above.
INTERCUT: 
INTERCUT: 29. EARLE'S POV
INTERCUT: His careful psychopathic eye SCANS the row of ladies, pausing a moment on Shelly; then
INTERCUT: Donna, and Audrey. We then PAN over to, and HOLD on, Annie.
INTERCUT: 30. BACK TO SCENE
INTERCUT: Doc Hayward walks back on the stage.
INTERCUT: Thanks to our contestants. The balloting will now
INTERCUT: commence and we will then announce our winner.
INTERCUT: 31. BACKSTAGE
INTERCUT: Lucy has succeeded in pulling aside Andy and Tremayne.
INTERCUT: Have you both forgotten what day this is?
INTERCUT: The two men look at each other. The answer seems too obvious.
INTERCUT: Miss Twin Peaks Day?
INTERCUT: Today is the day my unborn child receives a father
INTERCUT: It was right on the tip of my tongue.
INTERCUT: I have decided that regardless of which individual is
INTERCUT: biologically responsible ...
INTERCUT: #2.021 Revised 2-22-91, CHERRY
INTERCUT: 31. CONTINUED:
INTERCUT: ... that I want Andy to be the father of my child.
INTERCUT: Both men attempt to digest this. Tremayne is tremendously relieved.
INTERCUT: Really?
INTERCUT: I'm sorry, Dick, but I have to do what's best for little
INTERCUT: what's his name.
INTERCUT: Not at all. A sound choice. Heartiest congratulations,
INTERCUT: Andrew. Now if you'll excuse me, I do have a vote to
INTERCUT: cast myself ...
INTERCUT: Here's to the children.
INTERCUT: He goes. Not quite the moment Lucy expected. She glares after him.
INTERCUT: Don't sound so disappointed.
INTERCUT: My God Lucy, I am so honored you made this decision
INTERCUT: and I promise I will be a great father, but right now, I
INTERCUT: have to find Agent Cooper.
INTERCUT: He runs off. Lucy remains standing there.
INTERCUT: Men.
INTERCUT: 32. ANOTHER PART OF BACKSTAGE
INTERCUT: Donna searches for, spots and approaches Ben Horne. Her emotions are near the breaking point.
INTERCUT: I want to know what's going on between you and my
INTERCUT: mother.
INTERCUT: Donna, I believe the wisest course would be for all of us
INTERCUT: to sit down together and talk this out.
INTERCUT: #2.021 Revised 2-22-91, CHERRY
INTERCUT: 32. CONTINUED:
INTERCUT: NO.
INTERCUT: Donna -
INTERCUT: Old pictures and Horne bearer bonds in the attic. Love
INTERCUT: letters to my mom.
INTERCUT: Donna, I want to tell you the truth. I want to do the right
INTERCUT: thing -
INTERCUT: A birth certificate with no father's name on it. What the
INTERCUT: hell is going on, Mr. Horne? Why won't anyone tell me
INTERCUT: the truth?!?
INTERCUT: Tears form in Ben's eyes. Stunned, silent, overcome. He reaches for her. At that moment she,
INTERCUT: knows.
INTERCUT: Donna your mother and I ...
INTERCUT: Oh God. You're my father.
INTERCUT: Donna runs away. Ben calls after, he doesn't care who hears.
INTERCUT: Donna.
INTERCUT: 33. STAGE
INTERCUT: The girls stand in a line back near the curtain as Doc Hayward speaks into the microphone.
INTERCUT: It's now time to make the announcement. The winner of
INTERCUT: the contest and our new Miss Twin Peaks, is ...
INTERCUT: Annie Blackburne.
INTERCUT: Congratulatory screams of other contestants, who now hug the startled Annie. On the floor, the
INTERCUT: crowd reacts with generous applause. Cooper freezes, understands the danger she is in. Alert,
INTERCUT: he looks about the Roadhouse, determined to protect. Cooper remembers the catwalk, his
INTERCUT: premonition. He looks up. Someone is standing in the shadows overhead. Windom Earle.
INTERCUT: Cooper leaps forward. Meanwhile, an uproar from the judge's booth. Mayor Milford.
INTERCUT: #2.021 Revised 2-22-91, CHERRY
INTERCUT: 33. CONTINUED:
INTERCUT: This is an outrage. She's been living in this town for about
INTERCUT: fifteen minutes!
INTERCUT: What the hell got into you?
INTERCUT: She gave a beautiful speech, inherent in her message were
INTERCUT: words even the most craven among us can ill afford to
INTERCUT: ignore -
INTERCUT: She stole half of it off a dead Indian, she plagiarized that
INTERCUT: speech -
INTERCUT: She didn't plagiarize, she quoted.
INTERCUT: You voted for your own sister!
INTERCUT: And you voted for your girl friend!
INTERCUT: 34. ON THE CATWALK
INTERCUT: Cooper climbs up to the catwalk, hurls himself atop it. He draws his gun, looks ahead.
INTERCUT: Windom Earle stands at the other end, grinning from ear to ear. As the pandemonium
INTERCUT: continues below:
INTERCUT: Windom. Don't move.
INTERCUT: Cooper takes careful steps along the catwalk, gun aimed at Earle's chest. Looking out for
INTERCUT: traps, deadly surprises. Oddly, Earle says nothing, merely grins. A ghoulish apparition
INTERCUT: positioned in the far shadows.
INTERCUT: Dear heart. You are, if nothing else, consistent. As you
INTERCUT: have no doubt realized, our little game of four-
INTERCUT: dimmensional chess has concluded. And once, dear,
INTERCUT: dim, Dale - you have left your Queen unprotected.
INTERCUT: Forgive me. I amuse myself. You see, twenty years ago I
INTERCUT: made a promise. And tonight, I keep it ... in the Black
INTERCUT: Lodge.
INTERCUT: Farewell. I must be going.
INTERCUT: #2.021 Revised 2-22-91, CHERRY
INTERCUT: 34. CONTINUED:
INTERCUT: Earle holds up his arms to conduct an invisible orchestra. Then he slashes downward - and
INTERCUT: SUDDENLY the lights go out. MUTED SOUNDS of little explosives going off: smoke
INTERCUT: bombs. A COLORED STROBE LIGHT begins flashing, exposing in pulsations the growing
INTERCUT: pall of smoke. A SIREN then starts wailing through the room. Screams erupt in concordance,
INTERCUT: people are now scurrying about in panic. On the catwalk, Cooper races forward, lights
INTERCUT: flashing, smoke obscuring... only to find that Windom Earle is gone.
INTERCUT: On stage, pandemonium, the girls huddle in fright. A sandbag falls from above, LANDS on
INTERCUT: Nadine's head. More pandemonium, screams. CLOSE ON Annie, her own acute fear.
INTERCUT: Suddenly she hears a voice in the dark.
INTERCUT: Don't be afraid. Let me help you.
INTERCUT: A hand reaches out to her. Annie takes it, tentative. Once in its grasp, Annie is JERKED
INTERCUT: forward. Face to face with her captor, Windom Earle. Annie tries to SCREAM. Earle whips
INTERCUT: her away into the dark.
INTERCUT: Cooper leaps down from the catwalk, now searching for Annie as well as his nemesis.
INTERCUT: ANNIE!
INTERCUT: Suddenly: the siren STOPS. Chaos everywhere. Cooper fights his way through the crowd,
INTERCUT: eyes searching. Annie is nowhere in sight.
INTERCUT: Truman hurries over. Cooper stares out into the darkness, hopeless. The strobe dies. Smoke
INTERCUT: is clearing.
INTERCUT: Everyone's okay.
INTERCUT: He took Annie. He took Annie.
INTERCUT: I'll get everybody on it. Bastard won't get half a mile
INTERCUT: from here.
INTERCUT: Truman moves off purposefully. Cooper continues staring out ahead. Andy arrives, at wit's
INTERCUT: end.
INTERCUT: Agent Cooper, I've been looking all over, for you....
INTERCUT: Andy, they're going to need you outside.
INTERCUT: This is important, that cave painting in the office, I
INTERCUT: finally figured it out.
INTERCUT: #2.021
INTERCUT: 34. CONTINUED:
INTERCUT: What's that?
INTERCUT: I knew I'd seen it someplace before. I know where it's
INTERCUT: telling us to go, it's not a puzzle at all ... it's a map.
INTERCUT: Galvanized, Cooper stares at the unlined, boundless face of Andy Brennan.
FADE OUT: 
FADE OUT: THE END
