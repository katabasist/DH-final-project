FADE OUT: 7. INT. DOUBLER DINER - DAY
FADE OUT: ANNIE BLACKBURNE cleans the counter, crumples up one of the ubiquitous Miss Twin
FADE OUT: Peaks flyers. She looks up to see Cooper.
FADE OUT: Can't hurt to give it a shot.
FADE OUT: Maybe next year.
FADE OUT: There's a whole new world out there, Annie. jump in.
FADE OUT: "Hear the other side. See the other side."
FADE OUT: St. Augustine. Coffee?
FADE OUT: You bet.
FADE OUT: Annie pours, takes a closer look. Faint doubt amidst his ardor.
FADE OUT: Something's troubling you.
FADE OUT: Yes.
FADE OUT: Do you want to talk about it?
FADE OUT: I am involved in a complicated investigation that
FADE OUT: requires my total attention. Yet I spend most of my
FADE OUT: time thinking about you.
FADE OUT: I know the feeling. I've been seeing your face in fried
FADE OUT: eggs all morning.
FADE OUT: #2.020
FADE OUT: 7. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: There are those who believe in a scientific basis for
FADE OUT: attraction. It's chemical.
FADE OUT: Is that what this is?
FADE OUT: I don't know. Is it possible to understand without
FADE OUT: perspective?
FADE OUT: I spent five years trying.
FADE OUT: Faith.
FADE OUT: It's difficult for me. But I have faith in you. In us, as I
FADE OUT: understand it.
FADE OUT: We are very much alike.
FADE OUT: It helps.
FADE OUT: But we think too much.
FADE OUT: "What we observe is not nature itself, but nature exposed
FADE OUT: to our method of questioning."
FADE OUT: Heisenberg.
FADE OUT: They share a warm beat. Kindred spirits from another time and place. Annie deadpans:
FADE OUT: Maybe we should go bowling.
FADE OUT: No. Dancing.
FADE OUT: I don't know how.
FADE OUT: #2.020
FADE OUT: 7. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: I'll teach you.
FADE OUT: When?
FADE OUT: Tonight.
FADE OUT: Cooper takes her hand. They hesitate. Then, awkwardly, eagerly, they lean across the
FADE OUT: countertop to kiss.
FADE OUT: 8. INT. ROADHOUSE - DAY
FADE OUT: Decorations for the Miss Twin Peaks contest are being put up. A poster celebrating Norma as
FADE OUT: a past Queen is leaning against the podium. SHELLY JOHNSON and BOBBY BRIGGS
FADE OUT: rehearse on stage.
FADE OUT: Shel, I know I haven't been paying the right kind of
FADE OUT: attention to ya lately But when I saw that old guy
FADE OUT: kissing you ... something snapped. It's when I realized what
FADE OUT: I had or something. And I want to dedicate my time to
FADE OUT: that.
FADE OUT: Sounds great to me.
FADE OUT: So let's try to get through the rest. And then we can
FADE OUT: discuss it. Together.
FADE OUT: Shelly peeks at her speech, sighs, and continues her recitation:
FADE OUT: "Yes, I believe there are so many beautiful things in the
FADE OUT: world that should be admired and be thankful for. For
FADE OUT: example, Detroit auto makers reported a record year of
FADE OUT: sales for sports cars."
FADE OUT: I don't know, Bobby.
FADE OUT: What's wrong now?
FADE OUT: #2.020
FADE OUT: 8. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: Well, for one thing, nowhere in this entire speech do we
FADE OUT: mention ecology, or forests, or anything.
FADE OUT: Bobby looks at the speech.
FADE OUT: I don't know where I'd put it. The speech is so damn
FADE OUT: tight as is.
FADE OUT: But it's supposed to be about that.
FADE OUT: Shel, you're gonna be wonderful. You'll win in a walk.
FADE OUT: And then we are off. Fade out on Twin Peaks. Fade up
FADE OUT: on Hollywood insider games. Sunset strip. Easy
FADE OUT: street, baby. Just like you always wanted.
FADE OUT: Maybe a new hairdo. Or some signature makeup. We
FADE OUT: got to mesmerize.
FADE OUT: Shelly sighs. Apology or not. He's hopeless.
FADE OUT: LANA BUDDING stares nervously at her fellow contestants. MAYOR MILFORD hurries
FADE OUT: into view, sits beside her.
FADE OUT: I've got great news. It's going to be Norma Jennings and
FADE OUT: Richard Tremayne. Tremayne is the third judge. It's in
FADE OUT: the bag.
FADE OUT: I have to be sure. I want to be sure that I'm going to win.
FADE OUT: My god, the guy's British - or Bahamian. He's bound to
FADE OUT: fall for your charms.
FADE OUT: We'll find a chance for you two to be alone. Wear one of
FADE OUT: those dresses of yours with the slit cut half way up to
FADE OUT: Seattle.
FADE OUT: Nestle up to him real close and when he gets a look at
FADE OUT: those gams of yours and smells that French perfume
FADE OUT: dripping off you and begins to drown in those brown

FADE OUT: Oh, god, stop it. Oh, you vixen, stop it. I can't take it
FADE OUT: anymore, why can't we elope and -
FADE OUT: Not till I've won. Then and only then will I marry you.
FADE OUT: You're so strict, darling,
FADE OUT: And I am the g.d. Mayor!
FADE OUT: It's no use. Lana will not be dissuaded. Milford takes head in hands.
FADE OUT: 9. INT. GREAT NORTHERN - DAY
FADE OUT: DOC HAYWARD finishes giving BEN HORNE a physical. Doc is purring his stethoscope
FADE OUT: away and Ben is buttoning up his shirt. Both are tense.
FADE OUT: The insurance company's sent me so many forms I could
FADE OUT: get a heart attack lifting them.
FADE OUT: You're fine. It's what in your heart that you should
FADE OUT: worry about.
FADE OUT: I know you have reason to doubt me. But I am only
FADE OUT: interested in doing the right thing. For the good of
FADE OUT: everybody.
FADE OUT: Doc takes a long look at Ben. He believes him.
FADE OUT: Then stay away from Eileen.
FADE OUT: I can't. Not as long as the lie survives.
FADE OUT: Dammit, Ben. It isn't that simple. I believe you. I
FADE OUT: applaud your desire to do the right thing. But goodness
FADE OUT: in you is like a timebomb. And there's nothing good
FADE OUT: about ruined lives.
FADE OUT: #2.020
FADE OUT: 9. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: It is a confusing and difficult process. But I must
FADE OUT: continue. I'm sorry, Will.
FADE OUT: Wheeler sticks his head in the door as he knocks.
FADE OUT: Jack! Come in. You know Will Hayward.
FADE OUT: Wheeler is obviously upset. For the first time unsure. He tries to be polite.
FADE OUT: I met your daughter the other day. Beautiful girl.
FADE OUT: I think I should get back to the office. Nice to see you,
FADE OUT: John. Ben, be careful please.
FADE OUT: Doc goes out. Ben motions to the chair in front of the desk but Wheeler is in too much of a
FADE OUT: hurry.
FADE OUT: Ben, I've been trying to find Audrey.
FADE OUT: She should be back any minute.
FADE OUT: I've got to go, Ben. They're gassing up the jet as we
FADE OUT: speak.
FADE OUT: Well, give her a call when you get to wherever it is you're
FADE OUT: in such a hurry to get to.
FADE OUT: Ben, a friend of mine, well, more than a friend, a partner,
FADE OUT: was murdered last night.
FADE OUT: Ben reacts with evident concern. Wheeler takes a chair and tries to relax.
FADE OUT: #2.020
FADE OUT: 10. INT. GREAT NORTHERN LOBBY - DAY
FADE OUT: Audrey moves through the lobby, tired but excited from her trip to Seattle. The clerk behind
FADE OUT: the desk sees Audrey.
FADE OUT: Ms. Horne. I have several messages...
FADE OUT: Just then: Deputy Hawk appears, intercepts.
FADE OUT: Audrey. Agent Cooper would like to see you at the
FADE OUT: Sheriff's station.
FADE OUT: Oh. Well, I have a lot of work to do, but maybe this
FADE OUT: afternoon
FADE OUT: Now. It's important.
FADE OUT: Audrey pauses to wonder. Then walks with Deputy Hawk toward the door.
FADE OUT: 11. INT. BEN HORNE'S OFFICE - DAY
FADE OUT: Wheeler explains his problem. Ben is panicked. Both seated on the office steps.
FADE OUT: Ben, I have to leave.
FADE OUT: Of course, of course.
FADE OUT: But what about Stop Ghostwood? How do I get a hold
FADE OUT: of you? I need more time.
FADE OUT: A brave man is dead. My friend. And now I have to
FADE OUT: take his place.
FADE OUT: You're not coming back. Damn this rain forest business
FADE OUT: anyway. Why can't you...? Sorry, sorry. See? I'm
FADE OUT: already backsliding.
FADE OUT: You'll be fine without me.
FADE OUT: #2.020
FADE OUT: 11. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: I don't know. I feel disarmed. I'm afraid that I'm weak.
FADE OUT: Ben Horne? Weak? I find that very hard to believe.
FADE OUT: Strive for goodness. Tell the hardest truth first.
FADE OUT: Do the best you can. That's all any of us can do.
FADE OUT: Ben sighs, offers his hand. They shake and then hug. Then get to their feet.
FADE OUT: Goodbye, John. I'm sorry Audrey wasn't here.
FADE OUT: Giver her this. Tell her I...
FADE OUT: Good luck. Come home soon.
FADE OUT: Ben watches Wheeler walk out the door.
FADE OUT: 12. EXT. WOODS - DAY
FADE OUT: Briggs walks through the woods, dog tired but enjoying the solitude and nature. He stops to
FADE OUT: inspect a particularly beautiful Douglas Fir. He runs his hands up and down the bark trying to
FADE OUT: remember something. He fingers the tattoo behind his head. From behind him he hears
FADE OUT: singing. He turns to see a COSTUME HORSE strolling down the path towards him. He
FADE OUT: stares at it, stunned. The horse stops singing. Looks it Briggs.
FADE OUT: Hello, Wilbur.
FADE OUT: A hand comes out from under the costume and a dart/tranquilizer whizzes out hitting Briggs
FADE OUT: who wobbles away from the horse. He makes it about ten feet then topples over. The horse
FADE OUT: stands over the downed pilot. Briggs desperately tries to focus on the horse head as it bends
FADE OUT: over him.
FADE OUT: What... what?
FADE OUT: #2.020
FADE OUT: 12. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: Earle takes off the horse head.
FADE OUT: Long time no see, Briggsie.
FADE OUT: He turns to Leo who stumbles about in the ass end of the costume.
FADE OUT: Leo, I think you have finally found your calling.
FADE OUT: 13. INT. SHERIFF'S STATION, INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY
FADE OUT: OPEN ON the three pieces of paper forming the poem. Cooper is placing them together.
FADE OUT: Shelly, Audrey, and Donna sit across from him.
FADE OUT: Each of you received a part of this poem. And each in a
FADE OUT: curious manner. Along with an invitation.
FADE OUT: We all went to the Roadhouse but nobody showed up.
FADE OUT: In the past few days have any of you had contact with a
FADE OUT: stranger? Someone that sticks out as peculiar or
FADE OUT: charming or just plain puzzling.
FADE OUT: Well, there was that weird guy that claimed he was a
FADE OUT: friend of Dad's.
FADE OUT: The same day I got my poem I got a ten dollar tip for a
FADE OUT: cup of coffee. That was pretty peculiar.
FADE OUT: And there was a funny old guy at the library. He asked
FADE OUT: me to read it to him.
FADE OUT: All three.
FADE OUT: Take a closer look, Shelly. Does the handwriting seem familiar?
FADE OUT: #2.020
FADE OUT: 13. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: It's Leo's.
FADE OUT: Cooper steels himself against the enemy.
FADE OUT: Listen carefully. I want you to check in with the Sheriff
FADE OUT: two times each day. Nine in the morning. Nine at
FADE OUT: night. Parents are to know your whereabouts at all times.
FADE OUT: When you walk to school, when you drive to work, I
FADE OUT: want you to make sure that you do not do so alone.
FADE OUT: Please believe me when I tell you to be very careful.
FADE OUT: You are in danger. We all are.

FADE OUT: 14. EXT. BLUE PINE LODGE - DAY
FADE OUT: 15. INT. BLUE PINE LODGE - DAY
FADE OUT: START CLOSE on the mysterious black box, now open, sent to Catherine Martell.
FADE OUT: CAMERA PANS, reveals the slightly smaller box found inside. Unlike the original, this
FADE OUT: box has a finely filigreed lid, the twelve signs of the zodiac inscribed on its surface. A
FADE OUT: HAND enters frame, pushes the zodiac signs. The filigreed squares give slightly, suggesting
FADE OUT: that the correct combination will open it.
FADE OUT: CATHERINE'S VOICE
FADE OUT: His servant woman, what's her-name, Jones, delivered it
FADE OUT: shortly after he died.
FADE OUT: Eckhardt's last request. A clever jape, perhaps. Or
FADE OUT: something of value..?
FADE OUT: Try the hammer.
FADE OUT: CATHERINE MARTELL and ANDREW PACKARD hover over the boxes. Catherine
FADE OUT: ignores Andrew, presses the zodiac signs with increasing frustration.
FADE OUT: Won't work. There's a secret to opening each box, and
FADE OUT: this one...
FADE OUT: ... is about to drive me mad.
FADE OUT: Catherine pauses, seems about to hurl it through the nearest window. She turns to her brother.
FADE OUT: Tell me some good news, Andrew. Anything.
FADE OUT: Our foreign investors are chomping at the bit, from Paris
FADE OUT: to Beijing. You'll get your golf course, Catherine. Right
FADE OUT: next to the Great Northern Hotel.
FADE OUT: Ben's doing everything he can to stop us.
FADE OUT: #2.020
FADE OUT: 15. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: He's too late. When the project was still in his
FADE OUT: possession, Ben cleared every possible hurdle. Zoning,
FADE OUT: impact statements. He was, and is, his own worst
FADE OUT: enemy.
FADE OUT: Andrew's focus shifts palpably to the mysterious box. He pushes the zodiac buttons, tries
FADE OUT: different combinations.
FADE OUT: As always. What...?
FADE OUT: Nothing, dear. Just trying a few simple combinations
FADE OUT: Let me.
FADE OUT: Catherine tries to get at the second box, but Andrew will not give way. The mysterious gift
FADE OUT: inspires a possessive mania in both.
FADE OUT: One minute, Catherine. Eckhardt's birthday, my
FADE OUT: birthday, I know, the date the gift arrived...
FADE OUT: Give it to me.
FADE OUT: Not again.
FADE OUT: She withdraws a third black box, a little smaller than the last. Andrew doesn't hesitate:
FADE OUT: I opened it.
FADE OUT: Andrew snatches the third box. And, before Catherine can intercede, sets it upon the table,
FADE OUT: grabs the hammer, and strikes it as hard as he can. The box splinters, opens. Catherine shoves
FADE OUT: Andrew aside, reaches into it...
FADE OUT: Oh, Andrew...
FADE OUT: ... And pulls out a fourth and final box. Small and slender, stainless steel. As mysterious as
FADE OUT: the rest. Catherine and Andrew pause to gaze at it, wonder what secrets are harbored inside.

FADE OUT: 16. INT. EARLE'S CABIN - DAY
FADE OUT: The sun makes its way through the cabin's window.
FADE OUT: EARLE'S VOICE
FADE OUT: When did you first see the symbol in Owl Cave?
FADE OUT: An ARROW flies through the air, sticks deep into a brightly colored target. And just inches
FADE OUT: from Major Briggs, bound upon it. Windom Earle stands at a near distance, holds out his free
FADE OUT: hand for another arrow. Leo, subdued by his recent beating, complies. But when Earle turns
FADE OUT: back to Briggs, Leo's eyes follow him with newfound mental vigor. He's beginning to reclaim
FADE OUT: his senses.
FADE OUT: I am not at liberty to divulge that information.
FADE OUT: Cheater.
FADE OUT: Earle lets fly another arrow, pinning Briggs right trouser leg to the target. And, judging by
FADE OUT: the spot of blood that appears, piercing some part of his flesh as well.
FADE OUT: What does the cave painting mean?
FADE OUT: I am not at liberty to divulge that information.
FADE OUT: Damn, but I love the military mind!
FADE OUT: Earle fires another arrow, this one strikes the target just inches from Briggs' ear.
FADE OUT: What's the capital of North Carolina?
FADE OUT: Raleigh.
FADE OUT: Earle extracts an ampule of amber liquid from his jacket, then a syringe. He draws the liquid
FADE OUT: into it.
FADE OUT: #2.020
FADE OUT: 16. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: Major, I admire your fortitude. Had I the time and the
FADE OUT: patience, we might continue this game indefinitely.
FADE OUT: However...
FADE OUT: Earle jabs the syringe into Briggs' chest with sudden violence.
FADE OUT: ...I have neither.
FADE OUT: Catch.
FADE OUT: Earle tosses the empty syringe at Leo. Leo dodges it. Earle turns back to Briggs. The drug
FADE OUT: takes hold quickly. Briggs struggles deep within a narcotic haze. Earle whispers, he means to
FADE OUT: test the drug's effect.
FADE OUT: Your name, please.
FADE OUT: Garland... Briggs.
FADE OUT: Garland, what do you fear most in the world?
FADE OUT: The possibility that love is not enough.
FADE OUT: Garland, please. I shall weep. How much does your
FADE OUT: wife weigh?
FADE OUT: One hundred and fifteen pounds.
FADE OUT: Good for her. Now, when did you first see the
FADE OUT: hieroglyph in Owl Cave?
FADE OUT: In...in dreams.
FADE OUT: What kind of dream?
FADE OUT: I went night-fishing with Agent Cooper. There was a
FADE OUT: bright light, the guardian beyond it. I was taken, but my
FADE OUT: mind...still I recognize the signs...
FADE OUT: #2.020
FADE OUT: 16. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: What do the signs mean?
FADE OUT: There is a time ... if Jupiter and Saturn meet ... they will
FADE OUT: receive you...
FADE OUT: A tremor ripples through Briggs. He begins to babble.
FADE OUT: Taht mug uoy ekil si gnimoc kcab ni elyts... Taht mug
FADE OUT: uoy ekil...
FADE OUT: Oh, Garland. I was hoping for a lengthy conversation.
FADE OUT: Leo. Put the Major to bed. I'm afraid his mind has
FADE OUT: begun to wander.
FADE OUT: Leo steps to the target, removes the ropes that bind Briggs to it. Earle pauses to remember the
FADE OUT: last words he told him.
FADE OUT: There is a time... if Jupiter and Saturn meet...
FADE OUT: Earle ponders as he repeats with delight.
FADE OUT: 17. INT. HURLEY HOUSE - DAY
FADE OUT: START ON a standing screen in the dark living room of the Hurley house. Slides projected
FADE OUT: upon it. Just now: Nadine in wrestling garb, slamming some hapless opponent to the mat.
FADE OUT: NADINE'S VOICE
FADE OUT: ...and this is me with last year's regional champion from
FADE OUT: Yakima. He was cute. But a little slow. Next!
FADE OUT: The slide changes. Nadine now appears atop a dazed opponent, a referee counts beside them,
FADE OUT: about to slam his hand on the mat to signal "pin".
FADE OUT: NADINE stands, peers proudly at the screen. MIKE, ED, and Norma are arrayed on the
FADE OUT: couch behind her. All equally uncomfortable, but determined to play along. DR. JACOBY
FADE OUT: runs the slide projector. Nadine continues, blissfully unaware:
FADE OUT: #2.020
FADE OUT: 17. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: And this is me with Brock Farmington, Triple A
FADE OUT: champion from Spokane. Unbeaten in eighty previous
FADE OUT: matches, superior upper body strength, thighs like bridge
FADE OUT: supports ...
FADE OUT: I pinned him in a minute five. Next!
FADE OUT: One last slide. Nadine with an armful of trophies.
FADE OUT: And this is me with all the stuff I won.
FADE OUT: Nadine turns to the couch, beams, curtsies. Ed leads the others in polite applause.
FADE OUT: Congratulations, Nadine.
FADE OUT: Way to go, babe!
FADE OUT: Nadine leaps upon couch next to Mike, gives him a big kiss. She takes his hand, holds it
FADE OUT: close to her breast. Jacoby turns on the lights, addresses the he resulting foursome.
FADE OUT: Thank you, Nadine. You're probably wondering why
FADE OUT: we're gathered here today. I have found that when a
FADE OUT: couple contemplates divor -
FADE OUT: - er, breaking up, it is sometimes. easier to talk about
FADE OUT: our feelings in the company of others. Nadine, maybe
FADE OUT: you would like to begin.
FADE OUT: Okay. Uhm. I guess it all started when I noticed
FADE OUT: Mike's buns in the hall at school.
FADE OUT: And...how are you feeling now?
FADE OUT: Well. A little guilty, I guess. I mean because I'm so
FADE OUT: happy and I worry about Ed being sad.
FADE OUT: Ed, are you sad?
FADE OUT: #2.020
FADE OUT: 17. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: No.
FADE OUT: Nadine. How does that make you feel?
FADE OUT: It makes me feel like maybe it's time for us to get on
FADE OUT: with our lives the best way we know how. And leave the
FADE OUT: past behind us.
FADE OUT: It's a startlingly clear-headed pronouncement. Nadine gives Mike's hand a brief, affirming
FADE OUT: kiss. Jacoby nods approval. He turns to Ed, prods:
FADE OUT: Ed? Do you have something you would like to tell
FADE OUT: Nadine?
FADE OUT: Nadine. Norma and I are planning to get married.
FADE OUT: A beat. All regard Nadine. Wait for her reaction. Finally:
FADE OUT: Really? That's wonderful, Eddie. 'Cause Mike and me
FADE OUT: are getting married too.
FADE OUT: That's news to Mike. Nadine squeezes his hand with superhuman strength. Mike's mouth opens
FADE OUT: in a silent scream. Then he flat out HOWLS.
FADE OUT: 18. EXT. GREAT NORTHERN HOTEL - DAY
FADE OUT: 19. INT. GREAT NORTHERN LOBBY - DAY
FADE OUT: Audrey returns through the lobby. She's in a hurry, looking for Wheeler. She races past the
FADE OUT: elevators, vanishes into a hallway. A beat. And the elevator doors OPEN, Wheeler emerges
FADE OUT: carrying his suitcase. He looks about the lobby. No sign of Audrey. Wheeler sighs, and
FADE OUT: carries his bag toward the door.

FADE OUT: 20. INT. BEN HORNE'S OFFICE - DAY
FADE OUT: Audrey steps into her father's office. Ben rises from his desk, hurries to greet her.
FADE OUT: Audrey! Welcome home!
FADE OUT: Ben takes Audrey into a warm embrace. But Audrey has other things on her mind.
FADE OUT: I got back this morning. But Agent Cooper wanted to
FADE OUT: see me, so -
FADE OUT: Is anything wrong?
FADE OUT: Some creep sent me a poem. Daddy, have you seen
FADE OUT: Jack? I called his room but nobody answered.
FADE OUT: While you were away, I had the most incredible
FADE OUT: brainstorm.
FADE OUT: What...?
FADE OUT: The Stop Ghostwood movement needs a spokesperson,
FADE OUT: someone with a highly visible profile to inspire our
FADE OUT: community to action.
FADE OUT: Daddy, where's Jack -?
FADE OUT: You can do it, Audrey. As Miss Twin Peaks you can
FADE OUT: become that spokesperson, you can use your public
FADE OUT: platform as a forum for environmental debate, you,
FADE OUT: Audrey, and only you, can take our message to the
FADE OUT: people.
FADE OUT: Ben. Where is John Justice Wheeler?!
FADE OUT: #2.020
FADE OUT: 20. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: Oh. He's gone.
FADE OUT: Gone?!
FADE OUT: Yes. Tragic, isn't it? Some tragedy in Brazil demands
FADE OUT: his immediate attention. He left you a letter, I have it
FADE OUT: here somewhere...
FADE OUT: When did he leave?
FADE OUT: Just now. The airport.
FADE OUT: Audrey snatches the letter from Ben hands, and races out the door.
FADE OUT: Audrey! Audrey, about Miss Twin Peaks, darling, the
FADE OUT: pageant is tomorrow!
FADE OUT: Too late. Audrey's out the door.
FADE OUT: 21. INT. GREAT NORTHERN LOBBY - DAY
FADE OUT: Audrey races through the lobby. She spies PETE MARTELL stepping toward the bar.
FADE OUT: YOU!!
FADE OUT: Pete Martell.
FADE OUT: Do you have a car?
FADE OUT: A truck. Runs like a dream.
FADE OUT: Let's go.

FADE OUT: Near sunset. A taxi sporting the sign "Tim and Tom's Taxidermy" and bearing a huge set of
FADE OUT: antlers on its roof rolls up to the lone jet on the runway. A voice is heard inside the taxi:
FADE OUT: Straight... hold... steady... stop.
FADE OUT: The taxi jerks to a stop in front of the jet. A piece of luggage falls to the runway, followed by
FADE OUT: Wheeler, who pulls himself to safety from the back seat where TIM PINKLE sits. His blind
FADE OUT: brother, TOM, sits behind the wheel in the front seat. Wheeler stares at the blind man. Tim
FADE OUT: explains his brother.
FADE OUT: He loves to stuff, and he loves to drive. Otherwise he
FADE OUT: sleeps.
FADE OUT: Well, I am very glad to have the opportunity to be
FADE OUT: thankful for arriving here.
FADE OUT: The pleasure is half mine.
FADE OUT: Remember, we'll stuff anything.
FADE OUT: Right.
FADE OUT: Tom shouts to Wheeler as he moves towards the jet.
FADE OUT: Welcome to Twin Peaks.
FADE OUT: The taxi pulls away under the direction of Tim's voice- "Right, easy, right again, straight."
FADE OUT: 23. INT. SHERIFF'S STATION CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
FADE OUT: The war room atmosphere pervades. Cappy poring over maps. A computer screen and
FADE OUT: terminal. And Deputy Andy standing before the blackboard, peering intently at the
FADE OUT: mysterious hieroglyph.
FADE OUT: Cooper and Truman share cups of coffee. Cooper peers at Briggs' calculations, sheafs of paper
FADE OUT: covered with figures and notations.
FADE OUT: #2.020 Revised 2-15-91, CHERRY
FADE OUT: 30A.
FADE OUT: 23. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: The symbols suggest a time. That much is clear.
FADE OUT: A time for what?
FADE OUT: I'm not sure. At first I thought the hieroglyph was a
FADE OUT: signpost. But what if it's an invitation instead?
FADE OUT: Or both.
FADE OUT: Exactly.
FADE OUT: Where is the Major?
FADE OUT: He should be back by now.
FADE OUT: Andy, give Mrs. Briggs a call. See if the Major's home.
FADE OUT: Truman turns back to Cooper, seees him looking off into the distance, preoccupied. The
FADE OUT: Sheriff assumes the usual brainstorm, wonders:
FADE OUT: What it is, Coop?
FADE OUT: #2.020
FADE OUT: 23. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: I was thinking about Annie Blackburne.
FADE OUT: I've never known your mind to wander.
FADE OUT: It's strange. I've been feeling this way all day. I
FADE OUT: proceed as usual, mind clear and focused. And then,
FADE OUT: suddenly, out of nowhere, I see Annie's face, I hear her
FADE OUT: voice. Naturally, I attempt to reorient myself, return to
FADE OUT: the task at hand. But her image remains. Sometimes I
FADE OUT: feel dizzy.
FADE OUT: Looks to me like a man in love.
FADE OUT: My symptoms suggest the onset of malaria. Yet I've
FADE OUT: never felt better in my life.
FADE OUT: Cooper looks at Truman, his sad expression. Love has torn him apart. And Cooper knows it.
FADE OUT: Sorry. I sound foolish.
FADE OUT: No you don't. You sound lucky.
FADE OUT: HOLD ON Cooper for a beat. Lucky indeed.

FADE OUT: Sunset. An attendant kicks the wheel blocks from Wheeler's jet. Portable stairs fold upward,
FADE OUT: closing Wheeler inside.
FADE OUT: 25. EXT. TRUCK IN MOTION - DAY
FADE OUT: Audrey points ahead to the airstrip and jet.
FADE OUT: There he is. Step on it!!
FADE OUT: #2.020
FADE OUT: 25. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: Pete lets out a war whoop, they barrel forward.
FADE OUT: 26. EXT. BLACK LAKE AIRPORT - DAY
FADE OUT: The truck careens onto the tarmac. The jet pauses. Audrey leaps out of the truck, runs to the
FADE OUT: jet, shouts up at the cockpit.
FADE OUT: HOLD IT RIGHT THERE!!
FADE OUT: Jack Wheeler's face appears in the cockpit window, grinning from ear to ear. He vanishes.
FADE OUT: Audrey races around to the exit door. It opens, the stairs unfold. Wheeler appears in the open
FADE OUT: doorway.
FADE OUT: I should have known a simple goodbye was out of the
FADE OUT: question.
FADE OUT: Audrey runs up the stairs into his arms. They kiss for a very long beat. Finally, Audrey looks
FADE OUT: into his eyes. No quips, no flirtation, no barrier between. Just the simple truth.
FADE OUT: I love you.
FADE OUT: I love you too.
FADE OUT: Do you have to leave?
FADE OUT: Yes.
FADE OUT: When will you come back?
FADE OUT: I don't know.
FADE OUT: I'm a virgin.
FADE OUT: What?
FADE OUT: #2.020
FADE OUT: 26. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: I want you to make love to me.
FADE OUT: Here and now?
FADE OUT: It's your jet.
FADE OUT: Thank God for that.
FADE OUT: Audrey and Wheeler locked in a loving embrace. Wheeler leads her inside.
FADE OUT: Pete watches them with a happy tear in his eye.
FADE OUT: 27. EXT. THE ROADHOUSE - NIGHT
FADE OUT: 28. INT. THE ROADHOUSE - NIGHT
FADE OUT: Couples dance to a slow country waltz on the jukebox. A banner proclaims: MISS TWIN
FADE OUT: PEAKS, OUR 20th ANNIVERSARY. Several contestants are visible throughout. A
FADE OUT: stagehand sets up a microphone on the stage. Annie sits at the bar. She sips from a soda, looks
FADE OUT: about. She's waiting for someone. Annie reacts, peers at the dance floor.
FADE OUT: Cooper stands amidst the dancing couples. He gestures for Annie to join him there. Annie
FADE OUT: demurs. But Cooper insists. He won't budge. Finally, Annie smiles, slides off the barstool,
FADE OUT: and steps into the dancing crowd.
FADE OUT: I'm not completely prepared for this.
FADE OUT: Think of it as a walking embrace. Two people stepping
FADE OUT: as one would step.
FADE OUT: Annie slides into his arms. A perfect fit.
FADE OUT: #2.020
FADE OUT: 28. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: So far so good.
FADE OUT: Now follow me.
FADE OUT: We'll follow each other.
FADE OUT: Cooper and Annie take tentative steps about the dance floor.
FADE OUT: Steady.
FADE OUT: Two people stepping...as one would step.
FADE OUT: You've got it.
FADE OUT: Genetic memory. Mom and Dad danced the Lindy.
FADE OUT: Cooper and Annie find a gentle dancing rhythm, their bodies close together. A beat.
FADE OUT: I like the way your body feels against my body.
FADE OUT: I was thinking the same thing.
FADE OUT: If I'm too forward...
FADE OUT: Annie surprises him with a kiss. They settle more deeply into each other's arms. Then, quietly:
FADE OUT: I want more than your kisses.
FADE OUT: For instance?
FADE OUT: I...
FADE OUT: Suddenly: the music STOPS, a voice intrudes, shattering the spell.
FADE OUT: #2.020
FADE OUT: 28. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: MILFORD'S VOICE
FADE OUT: Hello? Is this on...?
FADE OUT: Mayor Milford stands on the Roadhouse stage, taps at the microphone. All turn to face him.
FADE OUT: Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to our
FADE OUT: final night of festivities celebrating the Miss Twin Peaks
FADE OUT: pageant. As many of you already know...
FADE OUT: The microphone SQUEALS, a little puff of smoke drifts past the Mayor's nose. He looks
FADE OUT: about, addled, taps at the mike again.
FADE OUT: Damnation. Is this on...? Hello...?
FADE OUT: The microphone is dead. A STAGEHAND scuttles into view, attempts to replace it.
FADE OUT: Meanwhile, Annie quietly confesses, eyes straight ahead:
FADE OUT: What I mean is, I understand why you treat me with
FADE OUT: care. Why you hesitate. The convent evokes images of
FADE OUT: helpless women fearful at the thought of emotions other
FADE OUT: than those derived from scripture and prayer.
FADE OUT: But when you hold me, when we kiss, I feel safe and
FADE OUT: eager. I'm not afraid. Not of anything you make me
FADE OUT: feel. Or want.
FADE OUT: Cooper turns to her. They kiss for a long beat. Once again, Milford intrudes:
FADE OUT: MILFORD'S VOICE
FADE OUT: It's on? About time. Hello...? Welcome to our final
FADE OUT: night of festivities celebrating the Miss Twin Peaks
FADE OUT: pageant.
FADE OUT: Oh, hell. Where're my cue cards?
FADE OUT: Hello? Welcome to our final night...
FADE OUT: I'm beginning to tire of his interruptions.
FADE OUT: I don't know. He's cute.
FADE OUT: I think I'll enter after all.
FADE OUT: #2.020 Revised 2-11-91, GREEN
FADE OUT: 28. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: The Miss Twin Peaks contest?
FADE OUT: Why not? Local girl returns to strive for her crown. It's
FADE OUT: like a fairy tale.
FADE OUT: And you, its Queen.
FADE OUT: Cooper and Annie embrace in the middle of the dance floor. Slow motion FX. Cooper looks
FADE OUT: over Annie's shoulder, reacts. Music up. The GIANT steps slowly between dancing couples,
FADE OUT: arms spread, as if to welcome or warn. Cooper's circling steps take him in and out of view.
FADE OUT: Cooper pauses, tries to focus. The Giant cannot reach him. Not this time. And then, as
FADE OUT: quickly as he appeared...the Giant vanishes.
FADE OUT: 29. EXT. BLACK LAKE AIRPORT - NIGHT
FADE OUT: Wheeler's jet speeds down the runway, glides off into the night.
FADE OUT: Audrey and Pete watch it fly, illuminated by truck headlights behind them. Audrey's crying.
FADE OUT: Pete's crying too.
FADE OUT: What a gyp. I finally meet the man of my dreams and
FADE OUT: the next thing you know he's flying to Brazil.
FADE OUT: He'll be back some day. He promised.
FADE OUT: Sure. He promised to take me fishing and we never did.
FADE OUT: Love stinks.
FADE OUT: Fishing?
FADE OUT: Yeah. Pearl lake or something.
FADE OUT: I've got some tackle in the truck.
FADE OUT: You do?
FADE OUT: Audrey, there are many cures for a broken heart. But
FADE OUT: nothing quite like a trout's leap in the moonlight.
FADE OUT: #2.020
FADE OUT: 29. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: May I?
FADE OUT: Yes. You may.
FADE OUT: Audrey takes his arm. HOLD ON Pete and Audrey as they walk back to the truck.
FADE OUT: 30. EXT. WINDOM EARLE'S CABIN - NIGHT
FADE OUT: 31. INT. WINDOM EARLE'S CABIN - NIGHT
FADE OUT: The cluttered interior of Earle's cabin. Earle's three Queens, Audrey, Shelly, and Donna -
FADE OUT: posted upon the wall. Briggs handcuffed to a chair, mumbling incoherently. Leo held fast by
FADE OUT: his leg chains. Earle works feverishly, referring to the Owl Cave hieroglyph on his computer
FADE OUT: screen, a series of maps, open books before him. The books are astrological in nature, various
FADE OUT: charts and planetary configurations. Just now: Earle completes his computer rendering of the
FADE OUT: Owl Cave hieroglyph.
FADE OUT: If Jupiter and Saturn meet, oh what a crop of mummy
FADE OUT: wheat...
FADE OUT: Leo watches Earle closely. He seems more alert with each passing moment. And sympathetic
FADE OUT: to the Major's plight. Earle addresses him, teacher to pupil, gesturing to the hieroglyph.
FADE OUT: The planets that our babbling Major spoke of, are more
FADE OUT: than distant orbs. They are, in fact, a clock. A clock
FADE OUT: that tells a time. And the time...?
FADE OUT: Earle looks to Leo for the correct response. Leo says nothing.
FADE OUT: The time draws nearer with each ticking tock. Dale
FADE OUT: wasn't far wrong, the cave painting is an invitation of
FADE OUT: sorts, telling us when the revels begin. But what Dale
FADE OUT: doesn't know, is where to find it.
FADE OUT: Earle's fingers dance across the computer keyboard. Calling up two squares upon the screen.
FADE OUT: The hieroglyph. And a map of Twin Peaks.
FADE OUT: #2.020 Revised 2-8-91, PINK
FADE OUT: 31. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: For you see, the cave painting is not only an invitation...
FADE OUT: Earle taps instructions, watches as the two squares move closer upon the computer screen until
FADE OUT: superimposed atop each other.
FADE OUT: ...it is also, a map. A map to the Black Lodge.
FADE OUT: CLOSE ON COMPUTER SCREEN. It's a perfect match. A beat. And the two images
FADE OUT: begin to vibrate, almost imperceptibly. Earle leans closer. Music up. The images vibrate
FADE OUT: faster and faster, the superimposition has unleashed dark magic. Earle smiles, delighted.
FADE OUT: Begins to LAUGH. Leo holds his hands to his ears, pained by sound only he can hear. The
FADE OUT: vibrations reach a fever pitch and... the computer SPUTTERS and goes BLACK. CAMERA
FADE OUT: MOVES RAPIDLY TOWARDS THE DARK SCREEN...
FADE OUT: 32. EXT. MONTAGE/ WOODS - NIGHT
FADE OUT: Suddenly: a series of IMAGES, fast-paced, accompanied by the appropriate music, the
FADE OUT: sounds of owls, raging wind.
FADE OUT: JOSIE screams, trapped within the drawer pull.
FADE OUT: CAMERA POV races madly through the woods, headed toward the Black Lodge.
FADE OUT: Then, in an instant, quite jarringly - SILENCE, a grove of trees, the air still and calm. An
FADE OUT: eerie beat. An ARM coalesces in midair, inch by inch, now reaches about testing the cool
FADE OUT: night, fingers prodding. The wind begins to rise. Satisfied, the arm recedes, disappears.
FADE OUT: A beat. BOB'S disembodied HEAD follows. Fierce winds blow, shaking the trees with
FADE OUT: mighty force. Bob's floating head peers about, now snaps back into a feral HOWL. Then Bob
FADE OUT: VANISHES in a BLINDING FLASH OF LIGHT.
FADE OUT: The winds recede. All is calm again. Save for the patch of SCORCHED earth below.
FADE OUT: THE END
