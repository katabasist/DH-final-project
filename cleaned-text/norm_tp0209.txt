REVISED: 1. EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY
REVISED: SHERIFF TRUMAN angry and frustrated, walks with AGENT COOPER, HAWK, and
REVISED: ALBERT ROSENFIELD through the hospital/morgue parking lot. It's early. A thick fog,
REVISED: hangs in the air.
REVISED: The short answer is it's the work of the same ghoul who
REVISED: killed Laura.
REVISED: More fan mail. An "O" under Maddy's ring fingernail ...
REVISED: She had strands of fur clutched in her right hand.
REVISED: What kind of fur?
REVISED: White fox. The strands are laced with formaldehyde.
REVISED: A dead animal. Stuffed.
REVISED: Truman's not listening. He's got the killer in custody, or so he thinks. Investigative details are
REVISED: no longer his concern.
REVISED: I should make the calls. Leland will know how to get a
REVISED: hold of Maddy's family -
REVISED: Don't. Don't call anybody. I need twenty-four hours.
REVISED: For what?
REVISED: To finish this.
REVISED: It is finished.
REVISED: Stalemate. Albert intervenes, takes Cooper aside.
REVISED: #2.009.5d Revised 10-3-90, GREEN
REVISED: 1. CONTINUED:
REVISED: Cooper ... an observation?
REVISED: Yes, Albert.
REVISED: I don't where this is headed, but the only one of us with
REVISED: the coordinates for this destination in their hardware is
REVISED: you. Lock in. Go on whatever Vision Quest you require,
REVISED: stand on the rim of the volcano. Stand alone and do
REVISED: your dance. Just find this beast before he takes another
REVISED: bite.
REVISED: And perhaps you could follow behind him with a
REVISED: buglight attached to a pith helmet.
REVISED: Albert offers a snide farewell wave to Truman, peels off to his automobile. Cooper steps back
REVISED: to Truman and Hawk.
REVISED: God help me, I don't know where to start.
REVISED: Hawk puts a hand on his shoulder.
REVISED: You're on the path. You don't need to know where it
REVISED: leads. Just follow.
REVISED: Cooper looks at him. Then to Truman.
REVISED: Good luck.
REVISED: 2. INT. DOUBLER DINER - DAY
REVISED: DONNA HAYWARD sits in a booth in the morning sun, sipping coffee and working on her
REVISED: homework. A smiling JAMES HURLEY enters passing by ERNIE NILES who sits at the
REVISED: counter reading the sports page. Donna beams at James.
REVISED: I thought you'd never get here.
REVISED: #2.009.1 Revised 10-3-90, PINK
REVISED: 2. CONTINUED:
REVISED: James smiles and gives Donna a morning-after kiss. He slides in across from Donna. Takes a
REVISED: sip of her coffee.
REVISED: I went out for a ride this morning. Buried the needle.
REVISED: The engine sounded like music, like hundreds of people
REVISED: singing some huge song.
REVISED: What were they singing about?
REVISED: What do you think?
REVISED: Last night. I could sing about last night.
REVISED: James digs in his pocket and takes out a small gift-wrapped package.
REVISED: This is for you.
REVISED: Open it.
REVISED: Donna opens the box. Takes out a beautiful, but simple ring with the smallest of diamonds.
REVISED: Oh, James.
REVISED: I wasn't sure what size to get. The girl at the jewelry
REVISED: store has these big hands so I had to guess ...
REVISED: But I bet ...
REVISED: He slides the ring on her finger, where one would wear a wedding band.
REVISED: Perfect.
REVISED: James ... ?
REVISED: #2.009.4d
REVISED: 2. CONTINUED:
REVISED: I think we should always be together.
REVISED: Really?
REVISED: Yeah. That okay with you?
REVISED: It's perfect.
REVISED: James leans across the table, means to kiss her, the table and coffee between them. Donna
REVISED: laughs, James grins. Then gathers her into his arms the best he can, offers a lasting kiss.
REVISED: 3. HANK JENNINGS
REVISED: He slides up next to ERNIE who smiles watching Donna and James.
REVISED: You ever in love in the joint, Ern?
REVISED: Disgusted, Ernie goes back to his paper - the sports pages - trying to avoid Hank
REVISED: Remember that fourth floor game room? Where the
REVISED: boys did business? You played along or they tossed you
REVISED: over the rail. Four floors down to the cement. Guy
REVISED: landed it sounded like a cannon.
REVISED: I'm not interested in whatever you're selling, Hank.
REVISED: No, you got it backwards. You are interested, Ernie. I
REVISED: got a piece of something North of the Border, little
REVISED: gambling, some female company. Full service kind of
REVISED: place. See, Ernie, the way I figure it, your speciality
REVISED: being arithmatic -
REVISED: I have an MBA from Wharton's -
REVISED: Revised 10-3-90, PINK
REVISED: #2009.1 5.
REVISED: 3. CONTINUED:
REVISED: Excuse me. Here's the deal. I want this operation to
REVISED: grow. You're a guy who knows how to grease it. I'll need
REVISED: your help. And a good-sized chunk of Vivian's do-re-
REVISED: me. Kind of an "Inlaw Thing."
REVISED: You're confusing "In-law with Inmate."
REVISED: Either way we're talking about prison, aren't we?
REVISED: Our commonality of wrongdoing has nothing to do with
REVISED: true bonding.
REVISED: No, you see it's just like being back in the joint. 'Cause
REVISED: we got a fourth floor on the outside, too.
REVISED: Ernie tries to rise, Hank holds him firmly, moves closer, smiles.
REVISED: Don't make me give you the rail, Ern.
REVISED: Ernie is chilled by Hank's threat.
REVISED: 4. NORMA AND VIVIAN SMYTHE
REVISED: Norma watches Ernie move away. Vivian sits in front of an omelette.
REVISED: They are up to something.
REVISED: Norma, Norma, Norma ... darling, let the scales fall
REVISED: from your eyes.
REVISED: The men you and I fall for are boys. My legacy to you,
REVISED: I'm afraid, dear; strutting, adorable juveniles. We wipe
REVISED: their noses, wash their underwear, tie their shoes -
REVISED: Hank was doing hard time, not juvenile detention.
REVISED: That may be. But wherever they find themselves the men
REVISED: we love spend their life in the dark. And in Ernie's case,
REVISED: #2.009
REVISED: 4. CONTINUED:
REVISED: he's very good in the dark.
REVISED: Our job is to keep them there.
REVISED: She takes bite of the omelette. Points to it.
REVISED: Oh dear. Whatever fowl did you take these eggs from?
REVISED: Are we saying we don't like it?
REVISED: I'm afraid I'm going to hit a thumbtack.
REVISED: Can't you say anything nice? Mother, I've tried so hard,
REVISED: I try so hard and, and nothing's good enough for you; no,
REVISED: let me correct that, nothing I do, I ever do is good
REVISED: enough -
REVISED: The menu's are very presentable -
REVISED: I'm joking. Honestly, may I suggest something? If you
REVISED: want to serve a truly memorable omelette, try some
REVISED: white veal sausage with some morel mushrooms -
REVISED: Thanks. I'll go pick the mushrooms.
REVISED: 4A. DEPUTY ANDY BRENNAN
REVISED: Andy sits at the counter, feeling blue, ignoring the pie before him. He mutters a phrase to
REVISED: himself, as if to test the words, perhaps commit them to memory.
REVISED: J'ai une...J'ai une ame solitaire...
REVISED: Big sigh. Somehow it makes Andy feel better. As Donna and James step toward the register,
REVISED: he repeats, a little more confidentally:
REVISED: #2.009
REVISED: 4A. CONTINUED:
REVISED: J'ai une ame solitaire.
REVISED: Donna reacts to the familiar phrase with a start.
REVISED: What did you say?
REVISED: Nothing. Hello, Donna and James.
REVISED: Tell me what you said.
REVISED: It's French.
REVISED: I know what it is. Tell me.
REVISED: Hey, it's no big deal.
REVISED: J'ai une ame solitaire.
REVISED: How do you know Mrs. Tremond?
REVISED: Mrs. Who?
REVISED: Mrs. Tremond. Her grandson does magic tricks. He
REVISED: said this to me.
REVISED: But it was Mr. Smith.
REVISED: Harold ... ?
REVISED: #2.009.1 Revised 10-3-90, PINK
REVISED: 4A. CONTINUED:
REVISED: Andy nods, leans closer to impart a confidence.
REVISED: He left a suicide note. J'ai une, you know. It means I am
REVISED: a lonely soul.
REVISED: I have to find Agent Cooper.
REVISED: Donna, what the hell is going on?
REVISED: Donna turns for the door. James calls after, frustrated:
REVISED: Donna!
REVISED: 5. OMITTED
REVISED: 5A. EXT. MRS. TREMOND'S HOUSE - DAY
REVISED: Donna leads Cooper and Andy up the path to Mrs. Tremond's house, directly across from
REVISED: Harold Smith's. In mid-speech:
REVISED: Mrs. Tremond is the woman who told me about Harold
REVISED: Smith. She has a grandson. And he said it to me. The
REVISED: same words that were in Harold Smith's suicide note ...
REVISED: Maybe the boy said the same thing to Harold.
REVISED: Harold's world was in words. The suicide note was a
REVISED: message, it has to be. And it leads back here ...
REVISED: Donna knocks on Mrs. Tremond's door. A long beat.
REVISED: She's pretty old. If her grandson isn't here to open it ...
REVISED: There's someone inside.
REVISED: #2.009.4d
REVISED: 5A. CONTINUED:
REVISED: Just then: the door opens, revealing a WOMAN. Middle-aged. Pleasant in appearance. And
REVISED: most decidedly not Mrs. Tremond.
REVISED: May I help you ... ?
REVISED: Is Mrs. Tremond here?
REVISED: I'm Mrs. Tremond.
REVISED: Maybe it was your mother I spoke to.
REVISED: My mother passed away three years ago. I live alone.
REVISED: No. I was here. I talked to her. And her grandson, he
REVISED: was here too.
REVISED: But I have no children.
REVISED: But he was here. They were both here...
REVISED: Donna, maybe we should go.
REVISED: Donna? Donna Hayward?
REVISED: Yes.
REVISED: Just a moment ...
REVISED: Mrs. Tremond goes back inside.
REVISED: #2.009.4d
REVISED: 5A. CONTINUED:
REVISED: I've never seen her before in my life.
REVISED: But you said you delivered meals here -
REVISED: I only went inside once. The first time. When the old
REVISED: woman told me about Harold. I'm supposed to leave
REVISED: them on the steps ...
REVISED: Mrs. Tremond returns holding an envelope.
REVISED: The morning after poor Harold died, I found this with
REVISED: my mail. I meant to turn it in ...
REVISED: It's for you.
REVISED: Mrs. Tremond holds the envelope toward Donna. Her name is written there.
REVISED: It's Harold's handwriting.
REVISED: Open it.
REVISED: She does. Reveals a single page inside.
REVISED: It's Laura's diary; A page from her diary.
REVISED: Read it, Donna.
REVISED: A long beat. Donna peering at the familiar handwriting. Finally, in a whisper.
REVISED: February 21st. Last night I had the strangest dream. I
REVISED: was in a red room with a small man dressed in red and
REVISED: an old man, sitting in a chair.
REVISED: Cooper reacts. He had the same dream. Laura, the midget, forgotten secrets whispered in his
REVISED: ear.
REVISED: #2.009.4d
REVISED: 5A. CONTINUED:
REVISED: I tried to talk to him. I wanted to tell him who Bob is
REVISED: because I thought he could help me. But my words came
REVISED: out slow and odd. It was so frustrating trying to talk. I
REVISED: got up and walked over to the old man. Like I was
REVISED: going to kiss him. Then I leaned over and whispered the
REVISED: secret in his ear. I told him everything.
REVISED: Somebody has to stop Bob. Bob's only afraid of one
REVISED: man. He told me once. A man named Mike. I wonder
REVISED: if this was Mike in my dream. Even if it was only a
REVISED: dream, I hope he heard me. No one in the real world
REVISED: would believe me.
REVISED: Donna completes the page, now turns to the other side. She reads:
REVISED: February 22nd. Tonight is the night that I die.
REVISED: I know I have to because it is the only way to keep Bob
REVISED: away from me. The only way to tear him out from
REVISED: inside. I know he wants me. I can feel his fire. But if I
REVISED: die he can't hurt me anymore.
REVISED: I'm not afraid. I'll miss Donna and James. I'll miss my
REVISED: home. But I'm tired and Bob won't let me rest. Death
REVISED: will be like sleeping. I'm almost happy. And best of
REVISED: all ... I'm free.
REVISED: Donna looks up at Cooper, tears on her face. Andy's crying too. He puts his arm around her,
REVISED: comforts her.
REVISED: Laura and I had the same dream. But in her dream I was
REVISED: Mike.
REVISED: That's ... that's impossible.
REVISED: Yes, it is. Andy, take Donna home. I've got to find
REVISED: Gerard.
REVISED: Cooper moves off.
REVISED: #2.009.4d 12.
REVISED: 5C. INT. GREAT NORTHERN HOTEL ROOM - DAY
REVISED: Cooper enters cautiously. PHILLIP GERARD, wheezing and barely conscious, lies without
REVISED: bedclothes on a stripped mattress. DOC HAYWARD lays wet compresses on Gerard's
REVISED: forehead. Cooper moves to Hayward.
REVISED: He's completely dehydrated. Breathing getting more
REVISED: difficult. He needs the drug.
REVISED: Cooper moves to kneel beside Gerard.
REVISED: "Mike?" Mike, I need to speak to you.
REVISED: Any longer could kill him.
REVISED: A terrifying groan from Gerard.
REVISED: "Mike?"
REVISED: Gerard opens his eyes, takes Cooper's hand, nods, weakly.
REVISED: There isn't much time. Bob has killed again.
REVISED: Gerard winces, pained, looks away. Cooper brings him back.
REVISED: I'm close to knowing. But the last distance to close is
REVISED: the most difficult. I need to know something. I need
REVISED: you to help me.
REVISED: Gerard nods, grasps his hand, eager to help.
REVISED: Bob was in my dream. So was Laura Palmer. So were
REVISED: you. And Laura dreamt about me the night before she
REVISED: died. The same dream. I need to go back there and
REVISED: unlock my dream. The answer is inside.
REVISED: He leans over him to hear. Gerard struggles with every word. Fighting to stay Mike.
REVISED: Bob is a fire spirit. So are we both, both creatures of
REVISED: #2.009.4d
REVISED: 5C. CONTINUED:
REVISED: fire. Bob and I ... when we were killing together ... there
REVISED: was a perfect relationship; appetite and satisfaction. A
REVISED: golden circle.
REVISED: A golden circle ...
REVISED: Gerard gives him the "OK" sign. Which triggers another thought for Cooper.
REVISED: A ring. My ring. I gave my ring to someone. The
REVISED: Giant.
REVISED: He is known to us here.
REVISED: The Giant. Is he real?
REVISED: As real as I am. He can lead you to Bob.
REVISED: How?
REVISED: You have to ask him first.
REVISED: I'm sorry, I don't understand -
REVISED: You have all the clues you need. The answer's not here,
REVISED: my friend.
REVISED: The answer is here.
REVISED: He touches Cooper's chest.
REVISED: I don't understand, please -
REVISED: So much responsibility.
REVISED: Gerard goes slack in his arms. "Mike" is gone. Cooper holds Gerard's limp body. He looks
REVISED: at Doc.
REVISED: #2.009.4d
REVISED: 5D. INT. GREAT NORTHERN HALLWAY - DAY
REVISED: Cooper exits Gerard's room. He stops to think. Behind him, around the corner comes the
REVISED: world's oldest ROOM SERVICE WAITER. He's carrying a tray with a glass of milk. He
REVISED: stops to look at Cooper. Cooper realizes he's being watch and turns.
REVISED: I know about you.
REVISED: The Waiter winks at him. Cooper looks at him puzzled.
REVISED: That milk'll cool down on you, but it's getting warmer now.
REVISED: The Waiter gives him a thumbs up and moves slowly along.
REVISED: ... getting warmer now.
REVISED: The Waiter turns once, gives him another thumbs up and disappears around the corner.
REVISED: 6. INT. BEN HORNE'S OFFICE - DAY
REVISED: Sound of DISTANT THUNDER outside. A storm is approaching. Truman and a team of
REVISED: deputies are methodically searching the room. Truman going through records at the desk.
REVISED: Box and tag everything in these drawers.
REVISED: Cooper appears, pauses on the steps by the door.
REVISED: Coop. We found Horne's phone records.
REVISED: Here it is. The night Laura died. The phone call Leland
REVISED: told us about. Ben called her number from this office.
REVISED: Cooper spots the STUFFED FOX in the office, walks to it, as if he was the only person in
REVISED: the room. Examines the fur.
REVISED: White fox.
REVISED: White, dead and stuffed.
REVISED: #2.009.5d Revised 10-8-90, GREEN
REVISED: 6. CONTINUED:
REVISED: Maddy was here. There was a struggle; she grabbed this
REVISED: thing. Ben killed her in this office, then took her to the
REVISED: waterfall. He killed Laura and he killed Maddy, too.
REVISED: Albert stands in the doorway from the inner office. He steps through the deputies to Cooper.
REVISED: Madelaine Ferguson died night before last between ten
REVISED: p.m. and midnight.
REVISED: Ben Horne was in custody by midnight.
REVISED: That's as close as I can cut it.
REVISED: Ben Horne's blood test.
REVISED: Cooper glances at the information inside, hands paper to Albert. Albert peers at the results.
REVISED: Then, gradually, hands them to Truman. HOLD ON Truman for a beat. His ambiguous
REVISED: expression.
REVISED: Cooper?
REVISED: Cooper turns to Albert and Truman.
REVISED: I'll need you both to do exactly as I say. I have a plan.

REVISED: 7. INT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE, RECEPTION AREA - DAY
REVISED: The now-familiar plumber, ZIPPER, stands on a ladder at reception, working on a sprinkler-
REVISED: system nozzle in the ceiling. Lucy sits below the ladder at her desk
REVISED: ... 'nother couple minutes, I'll have this baby right up to
REVISED: code. Tweaking the sensors mostly. Don't want your
REVISED: sprinklers to be overly jumpy, you gotta set it just so ...
REVISED: #2.009.4d
REVISED: 7. CONTINUED:
REVISED: ANDY BRENNAN suddenly appears on the other side of the ladder.
REVISED: I want to talk about my child.
REVISED: Our baby, Lucy.
REVISED: Maybe.
REVISED: Maybe what?
REVISED: Maybe it is our baby. Maybe it isn't.
REVISED: Dick? Oh my Lord. Is he the father?
REVISED: At first I thought you were the father. But then you said
REVISED: you didn't have any sperms. Then I thought it was Dick.
REVISED: But now you tell me your sperms are better so as far as I
REVISED: can tell it's a fifty-fifty proposition.
REVISED: Andy grabs the phone, begins to dial with grim determination.
REVISED: Andy? What are you doing? Who are you calling?
REVISED: I want to speak with Richard Tremayne, please. Men's
REVISED: Fashions. Yes, I'll hold.
REVISED: You won't hurt him, will you?
REVISED: Andy flashes a look at Lucy worthy of John Wayne. I'll do what I have to do. Lucy melts just a
REVISED: little. Andy takes a deep breath.
REVISED: Tremayne? Brennan. Andy Brennan. We need to talk.
REVISED: That is, if you're not too busy.
REVISED: #2.009.4d
REVISED: 9. INT. SHERIFF'S STATION - DAY
REVISED: Ben Horne aimlessly pitches pennies against his cell wall. A DEPUTY opens the door.
REVISED: Tojomura steps into view, pauses. Ben smiles as if they were meeting at a Men's Club.
REVISED: Tojomura-san. How nice of you to come calling.
REVISED: You are in prison.
REVISED: A momentary inconvenience, I assure you.
REVISED: For whom?
REVISED: Tojomura's sarcasm, however muted, takes Ben by surprise.
REVISED: Only myself. Can I help you in any way?
REVISED: We have papers to sign.
REVISED: The Ghostwood contracts. Tojomura-san, I'm afraid
REVISED: there's been a snag.
REVISED: Snag?
REVISED: The usual business disputes, delays. Unforeseen
REVISED: difficulties, some legal in nature, others ... I'm not able
REVISED: to sign the Ghostwood agreement at this time.
REVISED: I gave you five million dollars.
REVISED: Your check.
REVISED: Yes. Pen?
REVISED: #2.009.4d
REVISED: But I cannot sign.
REVISED: Then you will return my money?
REVISED: Well, I want to return your money, I want to sign the
REVISED: contracts for Chrissakes ...
REVISED: Tojomura-san, as you can see, I am incarcerated.
REVISED: Falsely accused. My brother the boy-genius is out
REVISED: looking for a better lawyer. And until justice is done,
REVISED: until I am able to breathe the air that free men breathe ...
REVISED: I plead with you for understanding. This is the long
REVISED: dark night of my soul. A time to seek that tiny
REVISED: flickering flame within. Business my God, I can hardly
REVISED: consider it, let alone competently proceed with our
REVISED: negotiations
REVISED: Forgive me I've been rather emotional lately ...
REVISED: Ben pauses. He'd cry if he could force a few measly tears from his ducts. A beat. Faint noise
REVISED: from outside the cell. And last is a naked foot comes INTO VIEW, placed gently between
REVISED: the bars, toenails painted a bright cherry red. Ben, head hanging, stares down at them. His
REVISED: brain reels. He'd know those toes anywhere.
REVISED: Ca ... Ca ... Catherine?
REVISED: Ben looks up, amazed. Tojomura speaks in the VOICE of CATHERINE MARTELL.
REVISED: CATHERINE/TOJOMURA
REVISED: Benjamin Home, you're a slimey rat bastard. And I
REVISED: intend to make whatever remains of your pathetic
REVISED: existance a living hell. Despite which, I can't help
REVISED: admiring your style just the tiniest bit ...
REVISED: "...that tiny flickering flame within."
REVISED: Overcome, Ben takes Catherine's foot into his hands. As if to caress and kiss it.
REVISED: Oh, Catherine. Oh thank God you've come. You're my
REVISED: only chance. My salvation.
REVISED: #2.009.4d
REVISED: 9. CONTINUED:
REVISED: Why, Ben. You're groveling.
REVISED: Yes I'm groveling. Dammit, I'm groveling for my life.
REVISED: Tell Sheriff Truman about the night we spent together.
REVISED: The night Laura was killed. Do you want me to beg?
REVISED: Because I will.
REVISED: Will you sign over Ghostwood and the mill to me?
REVISED: In a heartbeat.
REVISED: Catherine thrusts the contracts through the bars and smiles. Ben scribbles his signature upon
REVISED: the contracts. Catherine slips her naked foot back into its shoe.
REVISED: Clever disguise, Catherine. Brilliant really. Had me
REVISED: completely snowed. I have to hand it to you. Signed,
REVISED: sealed, delivered ...
REVISED: And so you'Il tell the Sheriff ...?
REVISED: I'll ... consider it.
REVISED: Catherine slips the contract into her jacket pocket, steps away. Ben hisses after.
REVISED: Catherine! Wait a minute! Catherine!! Wait!
REVISED: My God, it's the truth after all!
REVISED: Catherine pauses at the door, regards him with a wicked smile.
REVISED: Why, Ben. We've been lying to each other all our adult
REVISED: lives. Why let the truth spoil it now?
REVISED: And with that, Catherine walks away.

REVISED: had time to sit down and talk in so long, Can I offer
REVISED: you a glass of lemonade?
REVISED: No, thank you, Mr. Palmer. I only have a minute...
REVISED: This is for Maddy. It's a tape of a song we did with
REVISED: James. I wanted her to have a copy.
REVISED: Of course. How sweet of you. Maddy told me all
REVISED: about that. She said she really enjoyed the experience.
REVISED: Well anyway. If you could mail it to her I'd really
REVISED: appreciate it.
REVISED: That won't be any trouble at all.
REVISED: Donna notices Leland staring at her glasses.
REVISED: Is something wrong?
REVISED: No ... those glasses ...
REVISED: They were Laura's. Maddy gave them to me.
REVISED: I thought they looked familiar.
REVISED: Donna takes out a cigarette. Lights it.
REVISED: Mr. Palmer, did you know they found Laura's secret
REVISED: #2.009.4d
REVISED: 11. CONTINUED:
REVISED: diary?
REVISED: Diary? Yes, they took it from her room.
REVISED: Not the one the police took. She kept another diary.
REVISED: She never even told me about it, did you know?
REVISED: No.
REVISED: She gave it to a man named Harold Smith. He killed
REVISED: himself three days ago. The police found it in his
REVISED: apartment.
REVISED: My God. I had no idea.
REVISED: I wish I knew, what was in it, don't you? I think about
REVISED: her all the time. I must dream about Laura every night.
REVISED: Just then: the phone RINGS.
REVISED: Excuse me...
REVISED: Leland moves into the alcove to answer the phone.
REVISED: Hello ... Beth, how are you? ... No, not since yesterday ...
REVISED: Of course, I put Maddy on the bus myself ... I'm sure
REVISED: there's a perfectly reasonable explanation ... yes, I'll call
REVISED: you immediately, within the hour. 'Bye.

REVISED: I've got the cure for what ails you. It's simple, really.
REVISED: But it always improves my mood.
REVISED: Leland scurries over to the stereo, sets needle to vinyl. An old thirties dance tune is HEARD.
REVISED: He does a couple of soft shoe steps in Donna's direction. Then ... a KNOCK at the door.
REVISED: Wait right here.
REVISED: Leland steps off to answer. He opens the door, Sheriff Truman man enters, brushes rain from
REVISED: his coat. They converse quietly in the alcove. Donna remains out of sight.
REVISED: Harry.
REVISED: Leland, we need your help.
REVISED: What is it?
REVISED: I'm afraid there's been another murder.
REVISED: Oh my God. Oh my God, that's dreadful.

REVISED: glancing briefly toward the living room, Donna left behind him.
REVISED: Donna listens to the door slam. Her eyes bright with tears. There has been another murder.
REVISED: 13. EXT. HAYWARD HOUSE - DAY
REVISED: Doc Hayward works in his yard. He sighs, full of sadness.
REVISED: Dad?
REVISED: Hayward looks up, sees Donna standing before him. Full of sorrow. And rage. Hayward gets
REVISED: to his feet. A beat, then:
REVISED: It's Maddy, isn't it? She's dead.
REVISED: Let's not talk about it now.
REVISED: Tell me the truth.
REVISED: I'm so sorry. Yes, she's...
REVISED: How?
REVISED: Like Laura.
REVISED: No ... no ...
REVISED: Baby ...
REVISED: Donna shudders with anger, overcome. Her father steps to her, tries to take Donna into his
REVISED: arms. But Donna rips free from his grasp. She will not be comforted.
REVISED: NO! I am sick and tired of all this pain. Sick in my
REVISED: heart. Everything good turns to bad. No matter what
REVISED: #2.009.5c Revised 10-8-90, GREEN
REVISED: 13. CONTINUED:
REVISED: we say or do. No matter how hard we try. Someone has
REVISED: to stop it. Someone has to ...
REVISED: I love you, Donna.
REVISED: I don't want to talk about love. I...
REVISED: Donna can't stand it. She turns and runs.
REVISED: 14. EXT. THE ROADHOUSE - DAY
REVISED: 15. INT. THE ROADHOUSE -DAY
REVISED: Truman and Leland walk through the Roadhouse interior. Cooper and Albert are sitting at
REVISED: the bar. The mood is dreamlike, eerie. And will remain so throughout the following,
REVISED: punctuated by the sound of the storm outside.
REVISED: Why are we here? Agent Cooper? Is someone meeting
REVISED: us?
REVISED: Yes.
REVISED: The killer?
REVISED: I don't know. Perhaps.
REVISED: The main door opens. Big Ed Hurley enters; Ed looks about, a little confused.
REVISED: What's going on here?
REVISED: I want everyone to help me clear the floor. We're going
REVISED: #2.009.5c Revised 10-8-90, GREEN
REVISED: 15. CONTINUED:
REVISED: to need a large clear space in the center.
REVISED: Of course.
REVISED: Only too happy to help.
REVISED: Cooper hefts a chair, moves it from the center of the room. Ed, Hawk, Albert and Leland
REVISED: grab chairs, slide them toward the walls. Cooper returns to push at a table.
REVISED: You need me, just give the word.
REVISED: Ed gives the Bookhouse Boys sign.
REVISED: SHELLY JOHNSON wheels LEO JOHNSON into the room. Muttering, Bobby Briggs is
REVISED: led in by Hawk.
REVISED: Give yourself a raise, Hawk.
REVISED: Bobby, wheel Leo to the bar and be very, very quiet. Do
REVISED: you read me?
REVISED: Bobby sighs, wheels Leo as directed.
REVISED: Cooper clears the last table to the side. There is now a large open space at the center of the
REVISED: room. Cooper turns to regard it, checks his watch as if expecting someone else. All eyes are
REVISED: upon him. Ed and the others watch Cooper with varying degrees of confusion.
REVISED: The main door OPENS, Truman escorts Ben Horne inside. All turn to view him.
REVISED: Hail, hail, the gang's all here.
REVISED: Truman leads Ben to the others. Cooper turns to address the group.
REVISED: #2.009.5d Revised 10-8-90, GREEN
REVISED: 15. CONTINUED:
REVISED: Two days ago, another young woman was murdered by
REVISED: the indivudual responsible for the death of Laura Palmer.
REVISED: I have reason to believe the killer is inside this room.
REVISED: Some react with looks of disbelief - followed by glances at the men next to them. BEN
REVISED: keeps a cold eye on Cooper.
REVISED: As a Federal Agent I spend most of my time seeking
REVISED: simple answers to difficult questions. In pursuit of
REVISED: Laura's killer, I have used Bureau guidelines, deductive
REVISED: technique, Tibetan method, instinct and luck. But now I
REVISED: find myself in need of something new. Which, for lack
REVISED: of a better word, we will call magic.
REVISED: Pause. Cooper looks at the door, at his watch. The suspects stand together, nervous,
REVISED: uncertain.
REVISED: Would you like us to hum? Perhaps some pagan chant ...
REVISED: Truman and Albert move to Cooper.
REVISED: I think it's going terrifically well, don't you?
REVISED: Now what?
REVISED: I'm not completely sure. Someone's missing.
REVISED: Who?
REVISED: Brian, the leprechaun king?
REVISED: LIGHTNING AND THUNDER. Cooper looks at the suspects. He looks at his watch. He
REVISED: peers at the large clock above the bar; it strikes three o'clock. Three soft resonant bongs.
REVISED: A noise from the Roadhouse entrance, the door opens, light pours into the room. Cooper
REVISED: pivots to see the familiar silhouette of MAJOR BRIGGS. Accompanied by the Room
REVISED: Service Waiter.
REVISED: Excuse us ...
REVISED: #2.009.5d Revised 10-8-90, GREEN
REVISED: 15. CONTINUED:
REVISED: Major, you're right on time.
REVISED: I was on my way home. This kind gentleman flagged
REVISED: me down, asked if I could drive him here.
REVISED: Cooper and the Waiter look at each other. The Waiter winks at him. Gives him a thumbs up.
REVISED: Takes out a pack of gum and extends the pack. Cooper takes out a stick. There's a lightning
REVISED: bolt on the wrapper. Cooper puts the stick in his mouth. A FLASH OF LIGHTNING.
REVISED: I know that gum. Thar's the kind I used to chew when I
REVISED: was a kid. That's my favorite gum in the world.
REVISED: That gum you like is going to come back in style.
REVISED: Time stands still.
INTERCUT: 
INTERCUT: 16. COOPER'S DREAM
INTERCUT: Cooper is back in a dream. He looks down. On the roadhouse floor, a familiar mound of
INTERCUT: dirt appears at his feet. Something gold gleams inside it: Laura's heart necklace. But the
INTERCUT: heart is no longer halved, both pieces are joined. The heart shimmers, disappears:
INTERCUT: Out of it the fabric of his vision tears, shifts. And Cooper finds himself back in a familiar red
INTERCUT: room. The dream first seen in episode #1.002. Cooper sits in the armchair, mute. Laura leans
INTERCUT: close to him, smiling. She whispers. But this time Cooper hears and comprehends ...
INTERCUT: Ben Horne killed me.
INTERCUT: A FLASH OF LIGHTNING.
INTERCUT: We're back in the roadhouse. The GIANT appears holding Cooper's ring in the palm of his
INTERCUT: hand. In the same brilliant flash of light, the Giant disappears and Cooper's ring falls out of
INTERCUT: the air, bounces and rolls to a stop at Cooper's feet. He bends to pick it up. Slips it on his
INTERCUT: finger. We MOVE in on him. A long beat. Then, quiet, stern, Cooper turns toward Ben
INTERCUT: Horne.
INTERCUT: Ben, I would like you to accompany me to the Sheriff's
INTERCUT: station. You might want to bring Leland with you. As
INTERCUT: your attorney.
INTERCUT: Cooper nods to Truman. The Sheriff cuffs a stunned Ben Horne and leads him away. Deputy
INTERCUT: Hawk steps to Cooper.
INTERCUT: #2.009.5d Revised 10-8-90, GREEN
INTERCUT: 16. CONTINUED:
INTERCUT: The quest is over?
INTERCUT: One thing more.
INTERCUT: Hawk leans to receive his whisper. Hawk walks to the door. Cooper follows at first and then
INTERCUT: stops. He looks back towards the stage. He sees the Room Service Waiter wave at him and
INTERCUT: smile.
INTERCUT: 17. EXT. GAZEBO - DAY
INTERCUT: James rides up on his bike, hops off as Donna runs to him, hugs him, quietly hysterical.
INTERCUT: Evidence recent rain all about them.
INTERCUT: What is it? What's the matter?
INTERCUT: Maddy ...
INTERCUT: What about her?
INTERCUT: She's dead. It was the killer. The one who killed
INTERCUT: Laura. She's dead.
INTERCUT: Stunned, he moves away. His legs give way near the shore. Donna watches him helplessly.
INTERCUT: No ... no ...
INTERCUT: I heard Mr. Palmer get a call from her, from her
INTERCUT: mother, she said she hadn't gotten home, they came to
INTERCUT: talk to him, Sheriff Truman and so I went home, my
INTERCUT: father he was so upset he couldn't keep it from me ...
INTERCUT: She starts to cry. They can't comfort each other.
INTERCUT: We could've helped her.
INTERCUT: How?
INTERCUT: #2.009.4d
INTERCUT: 17. CONTINUED:
INTERCUT: I don't know
INTERCUT: (his anger startles them both; he suddenly sees a
INTERCUT: gulf between them)
INTERCUT: It's no good.
INTERCUT: What do you mean?
INTERCUT: You mean us?
INTERCUT: We can't do this. It's no good.
INTERCUT: What did we do? What did we do?
INTERCUT: Pause.
INTERCUT: I've got to go. I've got to go.
INTERCUT: He starts for his bike.
INTERCUT: James, don't leave ... it's not our fault!
INTERCUT: It doesn't matter. Don't you see? Nothing we do
INTERCUT: matters. Nothing's ever going to change. It doesn't
INTERCUT: matter if we're happy when the rest of the world goes to
INTERCUT: hell -
INTERCUT: Don't leave - James - don't leave me alone!
INTERCUT: He gets on his bike and rides. Anguished, Donna turns toward the lake, weeping, stepping
INTERCUT: slowly into the water.

FADE OUT: Doors swing open. Hawk leads Ben in. Leland, Cooper, and Truman follow.
FADE OUT: Let's take him back down to interrogation.
FADE OUT: Hawk leads Ben off. Truman follows.
FADE OUT: Is he going to be charged?
FADE OUT: Yes.
FADE OUT: I'd like to begin bail proceedings as soon as possible.
FADE OUT: #2.009.5d Revised 10-8-90, GREEN

FADE OUT: 22. INT. DOWNSTAIRS CORRIDOR - DAY
FADE OUT: In the basement, around the corner from interrogation. Hawk leads Ben towards the door, as
FADE OUT: Truman moves ahead to unlock it. Cooper and Leland follow them around the corner.
FADE OUT: Truman unlocks the door, swings it open. Hawk grabs Ben from behind, moves him
FADE OUT: forcefully into interrogation.
FADE OUT: The moment Ben realizes he is locked in, he begins to howl like a caged wolf. Truman slams
FADE OUT: the door shut, Hawk locks it.
FADE OUT: The howling continues, a rabid sound; Ben, or rather "Bob", careens around the room,
FADE OUT: pounding on the walls, searching for an escape that doesn't exist, his incoherent cries echoing
FADE OUT: like the tortures of the damned.
FADE OUT: Leland stands by, stunned, speechless.
FADE OUT: ... Ben? ...
FADE OUT: That's not Ben.
FADE OUT: A gesture from Cooper and Hawk leads Leland back around the corner.
FADE OUT: How did you know?
FADE OUT: Laura told me. In my dream.
FADE OUT: Coop, I'm going to need slightly stronger evidence -

FADE OUT: How about a confession?
FADE OUT: 22A. INT. INTERROGATION - DAY
FADE OUT: Truman, Hawk, Albert and Cooper face Ben, sitting in a chair, handcuffs in front of him..
FADE OUT: - you have the right to an attorney. If you cannot afford
FADE OUT: an attorney one will be appointed for you ...
FADE OUT: Ben begins to laugh, a low, feral sound, snarling and contemptuous.
FADE OUT: Do you understand your rights as we've explained them
FADE OUT: to you?
FADE OUT: Of course he does.
FADE OUT: I suppose you want to ask him some questions.
FADE OUT: Did you kill Laura Palmer?
FADE OUT: Ben hoots and howls. Then ...
FADE OUT: That's a yes.
FADE OUT: Did you kill Madeleine Ferguson?
FADE OUT: What do you think?
FADE OUT: I'm asking you.
FADE OUT: Yeah, well, I guess I sort'a did, kind'a. I have a thing
FADE OUT: for knives ...
FADE OUT: ... kind of like that time in Pittsburgh, huh Cooper?
FADE OUT: #2.009.5d Revised 10-8-90, GREEN
FADE OUT: 22A. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: Cooper pales.
FADE OUT: Ben's been a good vehicle. I've enjoyed the ride. But
FADE OUT: he's weak now and riddled with holes. It's nearly time
FADE OUT: to shuffle off to Buffalo.
FADE OUT: Does Ben know what you've done?
FADE OUT: Ben's a babe in the woods. With a large hole where his
FADE OUT: conscience used to be. And when I go, children, I'll pull
FADE OUT: the ripcord and you watch Ben remember. But not for
FADE OUT: long ...
FADE OUT: He laughs again wildly then stops with a jerk. His eyes close. "Bob" seems to be resting or
FADE OUT: waiting. Truman and Cooper look at each other.
FADE OUT: That's good enough for me.
FADE OUT: The group exits the room quietly.
FADE OUT: 23. INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
FADE OUT: Lucy faces both Tremayne and Andy. Tremayne reaches nervously for a cigarette.
FADE OUT: Here's how this is going to work. I'm going to keep my
FADE OUT: baby.
FADE OUT: Oh?
FADE OUT: That's not open for discussion.
FADE OUT: I see.
FADE OUT: Be quiet. Let her talk.
FADE OUT: 'Got a light?
FADE OUT: Andy fishes for a match, then realizes he doesn't carry them.
FADE OUT: #2.009.5d
FADE OUT: 23. CONTINUED:.
FADE OUT: No.
FADE OUT: Tremayne lights his cigarette with a lighter, speaks to Lucy.
FADE OUT: You were saying ...
FADE OUT: There's only one way to handle this. They have a test to
FADE OUT: determine the blood type of the father. It could be you
FADE OUT: or it could be you.
FADE OUT: Tremayne looks Andy up and down.
FADE OUT: They won't be doing that test until the baby is born.
FADE OUT: During which time I expect complete cooperation from
FADE OUT: you two "gentlemen."
FADE OUT: Whatever you say, Lucy. I mean, it's your baby.
FADE OUT: Thank you.
FADE OUT: The smoke from Tremayne's cigarette drifts lazily up to the ceiling. Towards the newly
FADE OUT: installed smoke detector.
FADE OUT: 23A. INT. CORRIDOR - DAY
FADE OUT: Hawk continues to monitor Ben thru the window. Cooper speaks urgently. Takes a piece of
FADE OUT: paper from his pocket hands it to Truman.
FADE OUT: Ben Horne's blood test.
FADE OUT: #2.009.5d Revised 10-8-90, GREEN
FADE OUT: 23A. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: Why? Why did he kill her?
FADE OUT: Laura wrote about Bob in her diary; Ben found it, ripped
FADE OUT: out the pages and she knew he was onto her. Ben placed
FADE OUT: that call to Laura from Ben's office the night she died.
FADE OUT: He was the Third man outside Jacques' cabin. He took
FADE OUT: both girls to the train car. It was his blood we found,
FADE OUT: not Ben Horne's.
FADE OUT: Then why kill Maddy?
FADE OUT: She reminded him of Laura. Maddy was going home,
FADE OUT: maybe he couldn't bear to part with her. He wanted to
FADE OUT: relive the experience. Or maybe she realized Bob was
FADE OUT: the killer and he found out.
FADE OUT: But there can't really be a "Bob." I mean Ben's just
FADE OUT: crazy Isn't he?
FADE OUT: Truman, Hawk, Cooper and Albert look at each other. Ben's howls fill the air.
FADE OUT: Shall we take a vote?
FADE OUT: From inside the room they hear Ben's voice.
FADE OUT: Ben'S VOICE
FADE OUT: "In the darkness of futures past/The Magician longs to

FADE OUT: As it climaxes, the electronic wail of a smoke alarm is heard.
FADE OUT: 26A. INT. CORRIDOR - DAY
FADE OUT: Cooper and the others look up; he's directly under the nozzle of a sprinkler head. The
FADE OUT: sprinkler heads spit water and start to rain. The corridor is filled with rain.
FADE OUT: 26B. INT. INTERROGATION ROOM DAY
FADE OUT: With a terrifying, howl Ben/Bob bolts up from his seat and howls at the rain. Then he rushes
FADE OUT: for the door ramming his head into it. He's knocked senseless, blood coming from a gash on
FADE OUT: his head.
FADE OUT: The foursome sprint into the room. Cooper rushes to Ben, wet and still on the ground,
FADE OUT: water continuing to fall in this room.
FADE OUT: Call an ambulance.
FADE OUT: Hawk rushes out of the room. Cooper gathers Ben in his arms. Truman, Albert stand by.
FADE OUT: Ben? ... Ben? ... Ben?
FADE OUT: That smell.
FADE OUT: Burnt engine oil.

FADE OUT: Ben's eyes flutter open. It's Ben. Bob is gone. And Ben is dying.
FADE OUT: Where ... where am I?
FADE OUT: You're here. Lie still.
FADE OUT: Ben spasms, a seizure gripping him. Albert helps Cooper restrain him, pulling his tongue
FADE OUT: from down his throat. It subsides. Ben moans, as his eyes reopen.
FADE OUT: The shadow ... he's gone ... I ... I remember ...
FADE OUT: Oh, my God ... Laura ...
FADE OUT: I killed her ... oh my God, I killed her ... I didn't
FADE OUT: know, I didn't know ... Laura, darling, forgive me ...
FADE OUT: It's all right. It's all right.
FADE OUT: I was just a little boy. I saw him in my dreams. He
FADE OUT: said he wanted to play ...
FADE OUT: ... and he opened me ... and I invited him ... and he came
FADE OUT: inside me ...
FADE OUT: COOPER.
FADE OUT: He went inside.
FADE OUT: When he was in me, I didn't know ... when he was gone, I
FADE OUT: couldn't remember ... he made me do things ... terrible
FADE OUT: things ... he wanted life ... he wanted others, others they
FADE OUT: could use, the way they used me ...
FADE OUT: Laura?
FADE OUT: They wanted Laura ... they wanted her, but she was strong
FADE OUT: ... she fought them, she wouldn't let them in ... they
FADE OUT: made me kill that girl, Theresa, they said if I didn't
FADE OUT: give Laura to them they'd make me kill her too ...
FADE OUT: #2.009.5c

FADE OUT: "They?"
FADE OUT: Tears are streaming down Truman's face as he listens. Albert is anguished. Cooper
FADE OUT: presses on.
FADE OUT: But she wouldn't give in.
FADE OUT: She said she'd die before she'd let them ... they made
FADE OUT: me kill her ... God have mercy on me, what have I done?
FADE OUT: What have I done? I love her ... I loved her with all my
FADE OUT: heart ...
FADE OUT: Be quiet now. Lie quiet.
FADE OUT: Laura, forgive me ... ...
FADE OUT: Ben is fading. Albert checks him out, looks at Cooper, shakes his head. Cooper turns BEN
FADE OUT: gently so that he's lying on his right side, holds him and begins to speak softly in his ear. The
FADE OUT: Tibetan Book of the Dead.
FADE OUT: Ben, the time has come for you to seek the Path. Your
FADE OUT: soul has set you face to face before the clear light ... and
FADE OUT: now you are about to experience it in its Reality, wherein
FADE OUT: all things are like the void and cloudless sky, and the
FADE OUT: naked, spotless intellect is like a transparent vaccum,
FADE OUT: without circumference or center ...
FADE OUT: Ben's face calms. His eyes clear. Albert and Truman watch, electrified.
FADE OUT: At this moment, know yourself and abide in that state ...
FADE OUT: Look towards the light, Ben, look towards the light.
FADE OUT: I see it ...
FADE OUT: Move towards it now ... into the light ... into the light ...
FADE OUT: into the light ...

FADE OUT: closes Ben's eyes. Above them, water stops flowing from the sprinklers.
FADE OUT: 27. EXT. WOODS - DAY
FADE OUT: A short time later. Truman, Cooper and Albert step through the pines. As if to seek refuge in
FADE OUT: the rain-fresh air. Major Briggs is standing in a clearing.
FADE OUT: He was insane. Schizophrenic. Gerard too.
FADE OUT: Was he?
FADE OUT: What's the alternative? Ghosts and goblins?
FADE OUT: An elemental spirit?
FADE OUT: Gentlemen, there is more in heaven and earth than is
FADE OUT: dreamt of in our philosophy.
FADE OUT: Amen.
FADE OUT: People saw him. People saw Bob. Laura. Maddy.
FADE OUT: Sarah Palmer.
FADE OUT: Then how did Ronette see him in the train car?
FADE OUT: #2.009.5c
FADE OUT: 27. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: Maybe the head injury. The trauma opened some kind
FADE OUT: of perceptual window ...
FADE OUT: How did you see him?
FADE OUT: That question may require a bit more self-examination.
FADE OUT: I've lived in these woods all my life. I've heard some
FADE OUT: strange things. Seen some too. But this is way off the
FADE OUT: map. I'm having a hard time believing.
FADE OUT: Is it easier to believe a man would rape and murder his
FADE OUT: own daughter? Is that any more comforting?
FADE OUT: No.
FADE OUT: An evil that great in this beautiful world. Finally, does
FADE OUT: it matter what the cause?
FADE OUT: Yes. Because it's our job to stop it.
FADE OUT: Briggs thinks, agrees, nods.
FADE OUT: Maybe that's all "Bob" is. The evil that men do.
FADE OUT: Maybe it doesn't matter what we call it.
FADE OUT: Pause. No one seems to disagree.
FADE OUT: Well. There's another thing that bothers me.
FADE OUT: They look to him.
FADE OUT: If he was real. If he was here and we had him, trapped,
FADE OUT: and he got away ... where is Bob now?
