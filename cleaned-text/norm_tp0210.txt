REVISED: 2. INT. PALMER HOUSE - DAY
REVISED: ON the Fireplace MANTLE, a still life: bouquet of FLOWERS, with LAURA'S framed
REVISED: PROM QUEEN PHOTO, on one side, and in a matching frame, a PHOTO OF LELAND
REVISED: on the other. CAMERA MOVES over to the sofa. SARAH PALMER sits with DOC
REVISED: HAYWARD - holding her hand. She's dressed in black, and Doc's wearing a somber suit.
REVISED: Sarah I'd like you to take this.
REVISED: COOPER sits in a chair opposite them.
REVISED: No, Doc, I don't want it. I want to be there. Every
REVISED: single part of me needs to be there - for both of them.
REVISED: Today I bury my husband. Next to my only child. Her
REVISED: grave is still fresh. There's just a little bit of grass on it.
REVISED: She stops, numb with grief. Cooper leans in.
REVISED: Mrs. Palmer, there are things dark and heinous in this
REVISED: world. Things too horrible to tell our children. Your
REVISED: husband fell victim to one of them. Long ago, when he
REVISED: was innocent and trusting. Leland didn't commit these
REVISED: crimes. Not the Leland you knew.
REVISED: The man I saw. That disgusting long hair.
REVISED: He's gone. Forever.
REVISED: So is everything dear to me.
REVISED: Laura and Leland have gone from this life to the next. But
REVISED: they're with you always. Here ... and here ...
REVISED: Revised 10-12-90, YELLOW
REVISED: #2.010
REVISED: 2. CONTINUED:
REVISED: The experience we have of people doesn't leave when they
REVISED: do. If you close your eyes, you can see Laura blowing out
REVISED: the candles on her birthday cake, Leland mowing the
REVISED: yard, shaving at the sink ...
REVISED: Those moments are yours. Always.
REVISED: She nods, grateful. Cooper glances at his watch.
REVISED: It's time.
REVISED: She reacts - reality intrudes. Cooper rises, offering her his arm.
REVISED: Mrs. Palmer, I'd be honored to drive you.
REVISED: 3. INT. HAYWARD HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON
REVISED: CLOSE ON the dining room table arrayed with FOOD. Plates are being filled with ham,
REVISED: fried chicken, scalloped potatoes, green beans, waldorf salad, hot rolls, pecan pies, apple
REVISED: cobbler, etc. There's a quiet BUZZ of CONVERSATION.
REVISED: ANOTHER ANGLE reveals mourners as they gather. NADINE HURLEY stands alone,
REVISED: seemingly preoccupied, waving her hands back and forth over her shoetops. HANK
REVISED: JENNINGS stands at the buffet, loads up a plate of food. CAMERA FOLLOWS Hank as
REVISED: he moves through the crowd.
REVISED: #2.010 Revised 10-12-90, YELLOW
REVISED: 3. ANGLE ON SOFA
REVISED: MRS. PALMER sits on the sofa with AUDREY. EILEEN HAYWARD has parked her
REVISED: wheelchair next to them. Hank steps into view. He leans over, sweetly handing Sarah a plate
REVISED: of food.
REVISED: Here you go. While it's hot.
REVISED: Thank you very much.
REVISED: Hank pauses to receive her gratitude, then looks up, reacts. BIG ED HURLEY and NORMA
REVISED: JENNINGS stand together across the room. Talking quietly, sharing some confidence.
REVISED: Hank scowls, watches as Norma steps away. Then returns to the buffet.
REVISED: Do you invite people to these things or do they just show
REVISED: up?
REVISED: At a time like this people just naturally come together.
REVISED: It is a time of reaching out. I remember when my mother
REVISED: died there must have been a hundred people.
REVISED: I remember. Donna came to see Laura that night. They
REVISED: promised they'd be best friends for life. A bond against
REVISED: dying ...
REVISED: Eileen reacts - feeling bad for bringing this up.
REVISED: No, please, I want to remember. Donna spent the night
REVISED: that night. Leland said not on a school night, but I said it
REVISED: was fine.
REVISED: I remember that, too.
REVISED: Eileen takes Sarah's hand, and squeezes it - two mothers loving their daughters.
REVISED: 4. OMITTED
REVISED: 5. INT. DINING ROOM
REVISED: Donna's confiding in Big Ed - upset.
REVISED: This whole town's coming apart. And somehow James
REVISED: #2.010 Revised 10-12-90, YELLOW
REVISED: 5. CONTINUED:
REVISED: thinks it's all his fault. First Laura, then Maddy. Or
REVISED: maybe he blames me, I don't know. Two people in love
REVISED: couldn't cause something like this, could they?
REVISED: The tears roll down her cheeks - totally bereft. Ed gets out his handkerchief.
REVISED: C'mon, Donna, honey. He'll come back soon.
REVISED: Everything's gonna get better.
REVISED: Nadine rushes over, agitated.
REVISED: Excuse me, Eddie.
REVISED: Can you see my underpants in my shoes?
REVISED: Ed's completely flummoxed. He looks at her gleaming shoes.
REVISED: I looked down and thought I could see the reflection. Do
REVISED: you think boys have been looking up my dress?
REVISED: Sweetheart, I can't see a thing in your shoes. I promise.
REVISED: Satisfied, Nadine returns to the coffee machine. Donna gives Ed a sympathetic look.
REVISED: 5A. INT. HAYWARD FOYER
REVISED: COOPER stands by the staircase with Truman and DR. JACOBY. MAJOR BRIGGS joins
REVISED: them.
REVISED: Welcome home, Dr. Jacoby. You appear to have fully
REVISED: recovered from your recent setback.
REVISED: Nothing beats the restorative powers of Hanalei Bay.
REVISED: Agent Cooper, what's next for you sir?
REVISED: I'm not entirely sure. I've stockpiled a few weeks of
REVISED: vacation time. Now might be the time to cash 'em in.
REVISED: #2.010 Revised 10-12-90, YELLOW
REVISED: 5A. CONTINUED:
REVISED: For starters, would you care to join me for an incredibly
REVISED: pleasant evening of night fishing?
REVISED: You can fish at night?
REVISED: Heightens the meditative quality. Beta brain waves
REVISED: increase precipitously.
REVISED: It sounds incredible.
REVISED: How does sundown tomorrow sound.
REVISED: I've got a closet full of equipment. You're welcome to it,
REVISED: Cooper.
REVISED: Gentlemen, I'm grateful. I didn't know how I was going
REVISED: to leave Twin Peaks. You've built me a bridge; I'm not
REVISED: saving good-bye, I'm going fishing.
REVISED: 6. OMITTED
REVISED: #2.010 Revised 10-10-90, GREEN
REVISED: 7. INT. DINING ROOM
REVISED: DOUGIE MILFORD, septuagenarian publisher of the Twin Peaks Gazette, has squared off
REVISED: against his equally old brother, MAYOR DWAYNE MILFORD, over a plate of food.
REVISED: What's the matter, doesn't she feed you?
REVISED: You're just jealous.
REVISED: Jealous??? I wouldn't want to spend my time changing
REVISED: diapers. Besides, she's cursed.
REVISED: With his free hand, Dougie grabs Dwayne's ear, twisting as hard as he can. Dougie bellows
REVISED: #2.010 Revised 10-5-90, PINK
REVISED: 7. CONTINUED:
REVISED: in pain, the plate of food stairs to go - Norma grabs the plate, Big Ed grabs the two brothers.
REVISED: Hey now, c'mon you two, knock it off.
REVISED: I'm gonna stick his head in the gutter where it belongs!
REVISED: Dwayne manages a swift kick to Dougie's shin. Dougie yelps, and finally lets go of the ear.
REVISED: Dougie, Mr. Mayor, gentlemen, I'll ask you to please
REVISED: remember where you are. And why we're here.
REVISED: The brothers go in opposite directions - in a huff, Doc walks over to Cooper and Pete, who
REVISED: were watching this.
REVISED: Extraordinary display.
REVISED: The Mayor and his brother. Dougie owns the newspaper.
REVISED: They've had a running feud for about fifty years.
REVISED: Nobody knows how it started. Something about an old
REVISED: flame and a rumble seat. I'm not even sure they
REVISED: remember anymore.
REVISED: The nest's a little stirred up right now. Dougie's engaged
REVISED: to be married. To a babe.
REVISED: For the fifth time.
REVISED: She's twenty-two. He's seventy-eight. Kind of a January-
REVISED: December thing.
REVISED: Remember the first time Dwayne ran for mayor ... when
REVISED: was that?
REVISED: Uh, sixty-two, 1962.
REVISED: #2.010
REVISED: 7. CONTINUED:
REVISED: Dougie wrote an editorial, came out against Dwayne.
REVISED: And Dwayne was running unopposed.
REVISED: Dwayne was dog catcher at the time. So he let all the
REVISED: dogs from the pound loose in Dougie's house.
REVISED: Damn dogs ate all the furniture. Broke up Dougie's third
REVISED: marraige, too, as I recall.
REVISED: Doc, Truman and Pete enjoy the memory.
REVISED: Harry, I'm really going to miss this place.
REVISED: They look at each other - Cooper's department is imminent.
REVISED: #2.010
REVISED: 8. INT. DINER - MORNING
REVISED: NORMA is behind the counter setting up for the day, VIVIAN helping, laying out napkins.
REVISED: Norma catches a look at herself in the MIRROR - then pinches her cheeks to give them color.
REVISED: You look marvelous. Suffering must agree with you.
REVISED: Why do you assume I'm suffering?
REVISED: This business. Your marriage. It's hard on a body, trying
REVISED: to do what you're doing.
REVISED: This is my life.
REVISED: That's the point I'm trying to make.
REVISED: Norma starts to respond to this latest affront when HANK and ERNIE walk through the front
REVISED: door, all decked out in hunting gear, carrying rifles, which Hank is using to demonstrate.
REVISED: The sight on yours drifts left; just aim a shade right -
REVISED: Behold the Great White Hunter. Try not to shoot
REVISED: yourself in the foot, dear.
REVISED: Darling, I used to shoot skeet. Didn't I tell you? I was
REVISED: collegiate champion in the Little Ivy League.
REVISED: We're after bigger game today.
REVISED: When did this little junket come up?
REVISED: Ernie wants to see wilderness. You know a better way?
REVISED: You girls mind the home front now.
REVISED: He takes Ernie's arm and pulls him back out the door - as Ernie waves good-bye to Vivian.
REVISED: Vivian turns to Norma.
REVISED: #2.010
REVISED: 8. CONTINUED:
REVISED: Henry seems unusually fond of my Ernie.
REVISED: Hank says it's like they've known each other in a past life.
REVISED: It gives me a weird feeling
REVISED: Hank's always given you a weird feeling.
REVISED: 9. EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - DAY
REVISED: 10. INT. HIGH SCHOOL - DAY
REVISED: Administrative office. VICE-PRINCIPAL GREEGE sits behind his desk, in conference
REVISED: with Ed Hurley and Dr. Jacoby.
REVISED: I want to be crystal clear about this. Your asking me to
REVISED: admit a thirty-five year old woman to the senior class?
REVISED: Strictly for medical reasons.
REVISED: Well, she never did actually graduate. As I recall, she
REVISED: left school to marry you, Ed.
REVISED: You got me there.
REVISED: We HEAR SOME VOICES outside and Nadine bursts in the door, wearing a little pleated
REVISED: skirt, puffy-sleeved blouse, tennis shoes and socks, hair in a ponytail - deep in teen-land.
REVISED: Eddie, how much longer? Class is starting!
REVISED: We'll be right out, Nadine. Just a few more minutes.
REVISED: Guess what - cheerleading tryouts tomorrow! I saw it on
REVISED: the bulletin board -
REVISED: #2.010
REVISED: 10. CONTINUED:
REVISED: That's great, honey. Why don't you practice your splits?
REVISED: He shuts the door, and sits back down. Greege tries to recover ...
REVISED: She's certainly trying to recapture that old school spirit.
REVISED: A classic case of clinical regression. Mr. Greege, what's
REVISED: important here is that Nadine be allowed to maintain her
REVISED: own reality. Being eighteen is all she can manage. And it
REVISED: could be a lot worse. Be glad she's not napping in a crib.
REVISED: Ed shudders. Greege reaches his decision.
REVISED: We will admit her under one condition: she has to
REVISED: perform like a regular student. Ed, my advice to you is
REVISED: can forget hot dinners. Nadine'll be busy doing her
REVISED: homework like every other senior.
REVISED: Ed nods. Grimaces. Another body blow.
REVISED: 11. INT. GREAT NORTHERN COOPER'S ROOM - DAY
REVISED: FISHING GEAR is arrayed against one wall: rod 'n reel, net, waders, etc. COOPER'S
REVISED: wearing a FISHING VEST while he packs. A black Samsonite is open on the bed - white
REVISED: shirts stacked inside. He softly hums. The door is open behind him. He hears a knock.
REVISED: Bellman?
REVISED: Customer relations. Has everything been satisfactory for
REVISED: you during your stay with us, Mr. Cooper?
REVISED: Aside from the ugly shooting incident, no complaints.
REVISED: When are you leaving?
REVISED: I'm going fishing.
REVISED: #2.010
REVISED: 11. CONTINUED:
REVISED: You're leaving.
REVISED: Audrey, I ... in effect I am leaving, yes.
REVISED: So this is it? You save my life, then break my heart.
REVISED: Audrey I've explained to you my personal policy of not
REVISED: getting involved with women who -
REVISED: I know, I know. I'm a teenager.
REVISED: And you were involved in a case I was working on.
REVISED: Someone must have hurt you once. Very badly.
REVISED: No. Someone was hurt by me. And I will never let that
REVISED: happen again.
REVISED: What happened, did they die or something?
REVISED: As a matter of fact she did. Would you like to know how?
REVISED: She was a material witness to a federal crime. We were
REVISED: supposed to protect her. Twenty-four hours a day.
REVISED: Myself and my partner, the man who taught me
REVISED: everything I know about being a special agent. I fell in
REVISED: love with her. And when the attempt on her life was
REVISED: finally made I wasn't ready. Because I loved her. She
REVISED: died in my arms. I was badly wounded. And my
REVISED: partner, Windom Earle was his name, lost his mind. Do
REVISED: you need me to be more specific?
REVISED: Audrey, chastened and horrified, shakes her head.
REVISED: I like you, Audrey and I care for you. I'll always
REVISED: consider you my friend.
REVISED: #2.010
REVISED: 11. CONTINUED:
REVISED: Friendship is the foundation of any lasting relationship.
REVISED: It's nice to be quoted accurately.
REVISED: Well let me tell you something, Agent Cooper; one of
REVISED: these days, before you know it, I'll be grown-up and on
REVISED: my own. And you just better watch out.
REVISED: Okay Audrey. It's a deal.
REVISED: With as much dignity as she can muster, she walks to the door, opens it and turns back to him.
REVISED: There's only one problem with you. You're perfect.
REVISED: She slips out, closing the door. Cooper sits down hard on the bed.
REVISED: Sometimes it's a burden.
REVISED: 12. INT. LEO JOHNSON'S HOUSE - DAY
REVISED: CLOSE ON BOBBY'S REFLECTION in a MIRROR, trying on a shiny, blue sharkskin suit -
REVISED: a little baggy. We PULL BACK to reveal the mirror is propped up in LEO'S LAP. Several
REVISED: TIES are draped over one of Leo's arms, and a SHIRT hangs from the back of his head.
REVISED: It's big - but it's bad.
REVISED: He looks over at Shelly, wearing sweatpants and a man's shirt - tired and depressed.
REVISED: Leo just got that suit. Fits him a little tighter.
REVISED: Well it's a shame to let good threads go to waste.
REVISED: What do ya think- blue or green? I gotta look good. Ben
REVISED: Horne's a man who notices these things.
REVISED: You look great. Bobby, take me out tonight. I'll get all
REVISED: #2.010 Revised 10-10-90, GREEN
REVISED: 12. CONTINUED-
REVISED: dressed up -
REVISED: What about the Leo?
REVISED: I'll get a sitter! Bobby, please, I've got to get out of
REVISED: here. I'm going crazy!
REVISED: Sweetheart, lover, listen to me. If I land this "job" with
REVISED: Mr. Horne, we're on easy street. I'll take care of you in
REVISED: ways you never dreamed of. Hang in there, and let
REVISED: Bobby do his thing.
REVISED: It's for us, baby.
REVISED: Over her shoulder, Bobby winks at Leo. He then he kisses her - long and deep. Shelly melts.
REVISED: Okay?
REVISED: She nods, placated. Bobby breaks away.
REVISED: I gotta ramble. So which is it: blue or green?
REVISED: Leo GURGLES.
REVISED: He likes the green. My man Leo.
REVISED: Doll face, cross your fingers, cross your toes. This is the
REVISED: big time.
REVISED: The door slams. We HOLD ON Shelly's face, abandoned. She looks over at Leo, holding
REVISED: the mirror, a human valet - and starts to cry.
REVISED: 13. INT. SHERIFF TRUMAN'S OFFICE - DAY
REVISED: CATHERINE MARTELL stands, looking out a window. Truman walks in carrying a cup of
REVISED: coffee and a small PAPER SACK. Truman sees her, stops short. Nearly drops his coffee.
REVISED: Hello, Harry.
REVISED: Forgive my saying so, Catherine. But you're dead.
REVISED: #2.010 Revised 10-10-90, GREEN
REVISED: 13. CONTINUED:
REVISED: Catherine shrugs, enjoying his consternation.
REVISED: Does Pete know?
REVISED: My husband and I have been duly reunited.
REVISED: Well, all things considered... Welcome home.
REVISED: Any questions?
REVISED: A couple.
REVISED: Am I under suspicion?
REVISED: I guess that depends on the answers I get. Maybe you'd
REVISED: like to call your lawyer.
REVISED: That won't be necessary. I have nothing to hide.
REVISED: Good. For starters, where the hell have you been the past
REVISED: two weeks?
REVISED: Do you believe in guardian angels, Harry?
REVISED: Angels? To tell the truth, I'm not so sure what I believe
REVISED: in anymore.
REVISED: I believe an angel saved my life.
REVISED: That gets his attention. Catherine braces herself.
REVISED: I was at home the night of the fire. A man called, a
REVISED: #2.010 Revised 10-10-90, GREEN
REVISED: 15A.
REVISED: 13. CONTINUED:
REVISED: voice I didn't recognize. He told me to meet him at the
REVISED: drying shed. A vague threat was implied. So I went
REVISED: there. I took a gun. That girl, what was her name?
REVISED: Shelly Johnson.
REVISED: She was tied up inside. A bomb went off. The rest is
REVISED: just impressions, walls of fire crashing, screams. I have
REVISED: no idea how I escaped. I came to in the woods. Afraid
REVISED: for my life. More afraid than I've ever been. I dragged
REVISED: myself through the dark for what seemed like forever,
REVISED: not even sure if I was dead or alive. As the sky
REVISED: lightened, things began to look familiar. The woods. A
REVISED: path. A rock formation. I was flooded with memories
REVISED: of my childhood. And I thought, well, this is what
REVISED: heaven is. That's when I saw our old summer cabin in the
REVISED: distance. I'd walked twenty miles through the night.
REVISED: Heaven was Pearl Lakes. And only a guardian angel
REVISED: could have brought me there.
REVISED: Catherine pauses to wipe the tears from her eyes. Truman leans to grab a box of tissues.
REVISED: Occupied, he doesn't see the brief sneer pass across Catherine's features.
REVISED: Thank you.
REVISED: We always kept a well-stocked pantry. I went in and
REVISED: opened a can of tuna fish. And I waited for whoever it
REVISED: was who had tried to kill me to come and finish the job.
REVISED: No phone, no newspaper, no television. I tended my
REVISED: wounds, a loaded gun at my side, terrified that each
REVISED: moment might be my last.
REVISED: Why did you come back?
REVISED: I ran out of tuna fish.
REVISED: A little bit of the old Catherine bleeds through. Sarcasm and superiority. Truman takes a
REVISED: closer look. Wonders just what she's really thinking. Where she's really been.
REVISED: #2.010 Revised 10-5-90, PINK
REVISED: 14. INT. SHERIFF'S RECEPTION AREA - DAY
REVISED: Catherine walks out, just as RICHARD TREMAYNE walks in. He makes a beeline for Lucy.
REVISED: My dove; great news - I've quit smoking!
REVISED: What are you doing here?
REVISED: I wanted to see you. I wanted - to be honest, I wanted to
REVISED: talk about our bambino.
REVISED: Our bambino?
REVISED: Lucy, I've been in a gnarly turmoil and do you know
REVISED: what I've discovered? I, Dick Treymayne, am a terrible,
REVISED: crashing bore. And what I desperately require in my life
REVISED: is something, no, someone more important than myself to
REVISED: think about, to care for. So perhaps you see why that
REVISED: as a result, I must say, parenthood suddenly appeals to me.
REVISED: Parenthood?
REVISED: Fatherhood, more specifically. And since I have no skills
REVISED: in this area, nurturing is a relatively foreign concept, I've
REVISED: enlisted myself in the "Happy Helping Hand" program;
REVISED: part-time big brother to some adorable, homeless waif.
REVISED: Excuse me, are you the Dick Treymayne who works at
REVISED: Horne's department store?
REVISED: HAWK walks through reception, glaring at Tremayne.
REVISED: Yes. And, Lucy, by the way, I have absolute confidence
REVISED: that the child is mine.
REVISED: Hawk makes a face, sickened. He rounds the corner, and runs smack into DEPUTY ANDY,
REVISED: who's been listening to all of this. Hawk reacts, but Andy sshushes him. Andy steps into the
REVISED: lobby, confronting Tremayne and Lucy.
REVISED: #2.010
REVISED: 14. CONTINUED:
REVISED: Lucy, Dick, I have something, I'd like to say.
REVISED: Andy, what is it?
REVISED: I would like to say that we're all in a very difficult
REVISED: position. I come from a large family. And Mama
REVISED: always said she couldn't have fussin' and fightin' around
REVISED: her when she had a bun in the oven. And until we know for
REVISED: sure who's gonna be throwing that baseball, or building
REVISED: that doll house we should all be friends.
REVISED: (extends his hand to a very stunned Tremayne
REVISED: who finally shakes it - wet noodle style)
REVISED: So you two go right talk, and I'll see ya.
REVISED: Lucy and Treymayne stare at each other. Andy backs out of reception and into the hall -
REVISED: practically collapsing into Hawk's arms.
REVISED: Andy are you crazy?
REVISED: Hawk, I know Lucy, and I know what'll get her. M orals
REVISED: and manly behavior.
REVISED: You think I went too far?
REVISED: They straighten up as Cooper enters past them, carrying fishing gear and goes into Truman's
REVISED: office.
REVISED: 15. INT. TRUMAN'S OFFICE
REVISED: Truman's making some notes, when Cooper walks in. Truman stands up, smiling.
REVISED: Harry, I guess this is goodbye. There's a frying pan full
REVISED: of steelhead trout out there with my name on 'em.
REVISED: That's why I figure you're gonna be needing this.
REVISED: Truman picks the PAPER BAG off his desk, and hands it to Cooper; awkward with the
REVISED: emotion he's feeling. Delighted, Cooper reaches into the bag and pulls out an intricately tied
REVISED: FISHING FLY - the brightly colored feathers and tinsel, with streamers hanging down.
REVISED: #2.010
REVISED: 15. CONTINUED:
REVISED: It's incredible.
REVISED: When those steelhead are running upstream, they're only
REVISED: thinking about one thing. Sex. A Green Butt Skunk
REVISED: breaks their concentration.
REVISED: A Green Butt Skunk.
REVISED: Tied it myself. My dad taught me how, and his dad
REVISED: taught him ...
REVISED: I don't know what to say ...
REVISED: There's one more thing.
REVISED: Cooper reaches in and pulls out a TINY PACKAGE, wrapped in tissue. He opens it,
REVISED: revealing a small round badge, like a Boy Scout merit badge; an embroidered DOUGLAS
REVISED: FIR TREE, with a SWORD in its center.
REVISED: The Bookhouse Boys Patch. We all carry it. I talked to
REVISED: everybody. We feel you're one of us now.
REVISED: Harry, I'm honored beyond any ability I might have to
REVISED: express myself.
REVISED: You wear that ... you ever need us, we'll be there.
REVISED: Harry extends his hand, Cooper grips it. A pact.
REVISED: 16. INT: SHERIFF'S RECEPTION AREA
REVISED: Truman and Cooper walk into the reception area: Hawk, Andy and Lucy are lined up. Like
REVISED: troops ready for review. Cooper stops, looking at them. Hawk sticks out his hand.
REVISED: #2.010
REVISED: 16. CONTINUED:
REVISED: Hawk. If I'm ever lost, I hope you're the man they send
REVISED: to find me.
REVISED: May the wind be always at your back.
REVISED: Cooper moves on to Andy, who's almost in tears.
REVISED: Deputy Andy, your bravery is exceeded only by the size
REVISED: of your heart. A rare combination indeed.
REVISED: They shake hands. Andy's too moved to speak. Cooper moves on to Lucy.
REVISED: Lucy, I wish you, and yours, the very best. And I hope
REVISED: you'll invite me to the wedding, whoever it might be.
REVISED: They embrace. She sniffles. The front doors fly open and PRESTON KING, a black
REVISED: Canadian Mountie in full, red uniform marches in. With him is a man who dresses just like
REVISED: Cooper, SPECIAL AGENT ROGER HARDY.
REVISED: Sheriff Truman?
REVISED: Yes?
REVISED: This is Special Agent Roger Hardy of the FBI -
REVISED: Hello, Roger, what are you doing here?
REVISED: Dale. We've got a problem. Effective immediately,
REVISED: without pay, I regret to inform you of your suspension
REVISED: from the FBI.
REVISED: ON COOPER'S FACE, ever stoic, we FADE OUT ...
REVISED: #2.010 Revised 10-5-90, PINK
REVISED: 17. INT. SHERIFF'S STATION - DAY
REVISED: Truman sits behind his desk, perturbed. Cooper sits opposite him. The Mountie leans
REVISED: against the wall, towering over them. Agent Hardy enters.
REVISED: Cooper, I suspect you know why I'm here.
REVISED: I don't.
REVISED: Internal Affairs.
REVISED: We're the agents who watch the agents.
REVISED: And his presence refers to my crossing into Canada?
REVISED: Now wait a minute, that was directly related to the case
REVISED: we were investigating.
REVISED: Not without my knowing about it it wasn't.
REVISED: What's the charge, Roger - misfeasance?
REVISED: Roger nods, serious.
REVISED: Mis-what?
REVISED: The improper and unlawful execution of an act that, in
REVISED: itself, is lawful and proper. The rescue of Audrey Horne.
REVISED: In part. There are also disturbing allegations as to your
REVISED: motives and your methods.
REVISED: What allegations?
REVISED: #2.010 Revised 10-5-90, PINK
REVISED: 17. CONTINUED:
REVISED: I'm waiting for some evidence to arrive. We'll convene in
REVISED: one hour.
REVISED: Alone.
REVISED: 18. INT. GREAT NORTHERN HOTEL - DAY
REVISED: Bobby confronts Ben's SECRETARY otuside his office door.
REVISED: Did you tell him it's about the tape he got in the mail
REVISED: yesterday and it's urgent? Would you tell him that
REVISED: please?
REVISED: The Secretary rolls her eyes, and goes back inside. Bobby fumes, now pacing, manic. He
REVISED: doesn't notice Audrey watching him.
REVISED: A little late for Halloween isn't it?
REVISED: What?
REVISED: What are you supposed to be, a lounge lizard?
REVISED: Shouldn't you be in school?
REVISED: School numbs my butt. Shouldn't you be?
REVISED: I'm trying to get an appointment with your father.
REVISED: What on earth do you want to talk to him about?
REVISED: A job - business. It's personal.
REVISED: I didn't know daddy dearest was hiring
REVISED: #2.010
REVISED: 18. CONTINUED:
REVISED: He will be - I Just need to talk to him first.
REVISED: You're up to something, Bobby Briggs. But I'm sure that's
REVISED: none of my business. Count to ten.
REVISED: She disappears into her father's office. Bobby's confused but counts anyway.
REVISED: One ... two ... three ... four ... five ... six ...
REVISED: The office door opens wide: Audrey smiles, success. Invites him in.
REVISED: First rule of business is you have to know who to talk to.
REVISED: Audrey I owe you one.
REVISED: 19. INT. BEN HORNE'S OFFICE - DAY
REVISED: Opera plays on a boom box. Looking slightly disheveled, Ben sits, stocking feet up on the
REVISED: desk, drinking a milkshake and playing with a weird electronic toy. He doesn't look up.
REVISED: Mr. Horne, I know you're a busy man and I respect that
REVISED: and so I'll get right to the point -
REVISED: I suppose you're here to ask me for Audrey's hand in
REVISED: marraige or some similar adolescent befuddlement
REVISED: No.
REVISED: Well, what then?
REVISED: Bobby sees the ENVELOPE he mailed Ben, laying unopened on the desk. Bobby picks it up,
REVISED: rips the seal, and takes out a CASSETTE TAPE.
REVISED: I already have somebody to open my mail, kid.
REVISED: #2.010
REVISED: 19. CONTINUED:
REVISED: Don't worry; it's from me. This'll just take a second.
REVISED: Bear with me here, Mr. Horne ...
REVISED: Bobby nervously tries to fumble the tape into the boom box on Ben's desk. Ben calls on his
REVISED: intercom.
REVISED: Samantha, could you bring in the fly swatter, please?
REVISED: There's a "bug" in my office.
REVISED: 20. INT. GREAT NORTHERN HALL/LOBBY - DAY
REVISED: Two HOUSE SECURITY MEN escort Bobby out of the hotel. He's been roughed up. In the
REVISED: lobby, Audrey looks over and sees Bobby pass by, flanked by the thugs.
REVISED: Bobby! Herman, Donald; I really don't appreciate friends
REVISED: of mine being treated like this. I may have to speak to
REVISED: Father about this.
REVISED: Her eyes shoot daggers. They're afraid of her. They let go of Bobby.
REVISED: Run along, boys.
REVISED: The Thugs move off.
REVISED: And you can tell your boss that tape's not the original.
REVISED: Audrey clocks this last bit of info. She and Bobby walk away, arm-in-arm.
REVISED: I can't imagine what all this was about.
REVISED: Audrey, that's twice you've saved my bacon. We could be
REVISED: talking sainthood. Anything I can do for you?
REVISED: How about an ice cream?
REVISED: Cup or cone?
REVISED: #2.010
REVISED: 20. CONTINUED:
REVISED: Cone. I like to lick.
REVISED: 21. INT. SHERIFF'S STATION CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
REVISED: The VIDEOTAPE of Cooper, recorded at One-Eyed Jack's, plays on the TV MONITOR
REVISED: Hardy and the Mountie sit on one side of the table, Cooper sits on the other.
REVISED: What was the purpose of your first visit to One-Eyed
REVISED: Jack's?
REVISED: To gather information about the murder of Laura Palmer,
REVISED: from, this man, Jacques Renault.
REVISED: Who you apparently lured back across the border, where
REVISED: he was wounded during arrest and subsequently murdered
REVISED: that night in the hospital.
REVISED: Renault was a material witness to Laura's murder. Leland
REVISED: Palmer confessed to Jacques' murder, which I believe he
REVISED: commited to prevent Renault from ever testifying against
REVISED: him. Are you judging me responsibile for that?
REVISED: Coooper looks at the Mountie. He takes TWO PHOTOGRAPHS out of a manilla envelope
REVISED: and tosses them in the middle of the table: one of BLACKIE'S DEAD BODY, the other of
REVISED: DEAD EMORY BATTIS.
REVISED: Let's talk about your second visit ...
REVISED: To rescue Audrey Horne from her kidnappers.
REVISED: Who both ended up dead.
REVISED: Hardy gives Mountie a look - he'll handle this.
REVISED: You know procedure. Crossing the border without
REVISED: contacting Canadian authorities is a serious breach.
REVISED: Under any circumstances.
REVISED: #2.010 Revised 10-5-90, PINK
REVISED: 21. CONTINUED:
REVISED: I'm not disputing that. Is it the Bureau's position I'm
REVISED: responsibile for these deaths?
REVISED: That's what we're trying to determine. This entire
REVISED: matter has been brought to our attention because Mountie
REVISED: King was in the middle of a sting operation to nail this
REVISED: man, Jean Renault.
REVISED: A photograph of Jean Renault is displayed.
REVISED: We worked six months to set this up; one night you march
REVISED: in, Renault escapes, these two are dead and the cocaine we
REVISED: were using to set him up is stolen from the premises.
REVISED: I don't know anything about cocaine. But you've
REVISED: miscounted; three people were killed., Jean Renault
REVISED: killed Blackie, I didn't know until now about the Battis
REVISED: murder. And a bodyguard who turned his gun on me was
REVISED: killed in self-defense.
REVISED: Hardy looks at the Mountie - who's been thrown by this.
REVISED: So we've got crossing jurisdictional borders, three dead
REVISED: bodies and international trafficking of drugs.
REVISED: Roger, I admit to the border crossing. You already know
REVISED: the extent of my involvement with the killings. I hope
REVISED: you know me better than to suspect I'd have any part of a
REVISED: drug transaction.
REVISED: I won't know that until you prove it, Cooper. I will tell
REVISED: you DEA's been called in to investigate. And you've got
REVISED: twenty-four hours to assemble your defense; in the
REVISED: meantime I'll require that you surrender your gun and
REVISED: badge.
REVISED: Pause. Cooper removes his GUN from the shoulder holster, and lays it on the table. From his
REVISED: shirt pocket he produces the case containing his BADGE, places it next to his gun. Hardy nods
REVISED: to the Mountie; he opens the door, summons Truman in, who's waiting just outside. Truman
REVISED: sees Cooper's badge and gun. Cooper stands, smiles at Harry. He walks out, head high.
REVISED: #2.010
REVISED: 1. CONTINUED:
REVISED: Sheriff, I'll need to ask you a few questions.
REVISED: I'll stand.
REVISED: Let me begin by saying that whatever Agent Cooper is
REVISED: guilty of will not be held against you; your cooperation
REVISED: will be very useful - and greatly appreciated by the FBI.
REVISED: If I understand the law correctly, you
REVISED: need extradition papers in order to get a statement from
REVISED: me. And you  need a subpeona from a judge.
REVISED: Unless either of you have the appropriate paperwork -
REVISED: you can take my cooperation and stuff It.
REVISED: That attitude will not serve you or Agent Cooper -
REVISED: It's not an attitude, it's a promise. I've had nothing, but
REVISED: respect for the FBI since the day Cooper walked into my
REVISED: office. He's the finest law man I've ever known; check
REVISED: that, the finest man period. I don't know what
REVISED: information you have or where you got it from, but I can
REVISED: tell you this ... it's dead wrong
REVISED: Truman turns on his heels and walks out.
REVISED: 22. INT. HIGH SCHOOL GYM - DAY
REVISED: CLOSE ON an animated TEENAGE GIRL'S FACE - cheering.
REVISED: STEEPLEJACKS, STEEPLEJACKS, ROLL 'EM!!!!
REVISED: ANOTHER ANGLE reveals CHEERLEADING TRYOUTS. Nadine is next in the line of
REVISED: AUDITIONING GIRLS. The P.E. TEACHER and Vice Principal Greege sit behind a
REVISED: table, judging. Behind them hangs a BANNER for the "Twin Peaks Steeplejacks".
REVISED: TWO WRESTLERS work out in another corner of the gym, under the WRESTLING
REVISED: COACH'S supervision.
REVISED: The Cheering Girl finishes off with a big jump in the air, touching both toes. The Pep Squad
REVISED: applauds. Nadine is waved forward and eagerly approaches the JUDGES' TABLE.
REVISED: #2.010
REVISED: 22. CONTINUED:
REVISED: Nadine Butler.
REVISED: Greege nods to the P.E. Teacher, who, trying to act normal, writes this down.
REVISED: P.E. TEACHER
REVISED: I'll need your permission slip, please, Nadine.
REVISED: Permission?
REVISED: P.E. TEACHER
REVISED: Signed by your parents.
REVISED: Oh. My parents are in Europe.
REVISED: TWO GIRLS in the line snicker. Greege intervenes.
REVISED: She's okay. I've spoken. to her hus - to her guardian.
REVISED: Nadine brightens.
REVISED: P.E. TEACHER
REVISED: Alright, Nadine, let's start you off with tumbling
REVISED: Nadine bounces over to center stage. A MALE CHEERLEADER stands by to spot her. He
REVISED: rolls his eyes - condescending. Nadine, grinning ear-to-ear, walks backwards. Further and
REVISED: further, as if this were her routine. We HEAR a few laughs.
REVISED: With a little jump, she starts running forward, and does a FRONT FLIP, followed by another
REVISED: FRONT DOUBLE FLIP, into a series of CARTWHEELS, landing right in front or the
REVISED: aghast MALE CHEERLEADER. She picks him up by his waist and tosses him into the air.
REVISED: Corkscrew!
REVISED: And he indeed SPINS through the air, across the gym, landing on the matt on top of the
REVISED: wrestlers. The Coach looks from the hapless cheerleader over to Nadine - very impressed.
REVISED: Nadine beams proudly, barely out of breach.
REVISED: 23. INT. LEO JOHNSON'S HOUSE - NIGHT
REVISED: SHELLY'S in the kitchen, brushing LEO'S teeth with an electric toothbrush. The whirring
REVISED: produces quite a bit of foam around Leo's mouth, running down his chin. The PHONE
REVISED: RINGS.
REVISED: #2.010
REVISED: 23. CONTINUED:
REVISED: I'm not answering -
REVISED: No! All day, not one word.
REVISED: It RINGS again, and this time Shelly turns off the toothbrush, slamming it down on the
REVISED: counter. She hops over Leo and answers the phone.
REVISED: Johnson's Nursing Home.
REVISED: Well that's just great, Bobby. I'm glad things went so
REVISED: well. This must've been the longest meeting, in history.
REVISED: CAMERA MOVES down, shooting Shelly through the spokes of Leo's wheelchair.
REVISED: Yes, I still love you. Bobby, I've been thinking, we're
REVISED: really gonna have to put Leo somewhere - in a home.
REVISED: The wheel of Leo's chair turns one full revolution, rolling slowly through the frame, and stops.
REVISED: It's not worth it. I don't want the money. I want a life.
REVISED: Shelly turns and starts to sit; stops, looking at Leo. Something's wrong, but she can't place it.
REVISED: Bobby, I think he moved. I swear, Leo moved.
REVISED: Okay, maybe I am losing my mind. That's what I've
REVISED: been trying to tell you. Get over here tomorrow, first
REVISED: thing. Please. Bye, lover.
REVISED: Shelly hangs up, and goes over to Leo - the foam still hanging from his mouth - looking quite
REVISED: mad. Shelly looks at where she thought the chair was, and where it is now. Could it be? She
REVISED: shakes her head. A long day. Shelly moves around in front of Leo, peering cautiously into his
REVISED: eyes.
REVISED: Leo Johnson, are you in there?
REVISED: Nothing. Shelly turns away, reaching for a towel. As Leo BLOWS A BUBBLE.

FADE OUT: #2.010
FADE OUT: 24. INT. DINER - NIGHT
FADE OUT: Cooper sits in a booth, drinking coffee, and studying a small PORTABLE CHESS BOARD,
FADE OUT: wearing jeans and a flannel shirt. Truman walks in, relieved to see Cooper, sits opposite.
FADE OUT: Who are you playing, with?
FADE OUT: Windom Earle. A formidable opponent.
FADE OUT: Cooper moves his pawn, then writes his move down on a piece of paper. He puts the note in an
FADE OUT: ENVELOPE, already addressed to Windom Earle, Personals Dept., USA TODAY.
FADE OUT: I've been looking all over for you.
FADE OUT: I went to the library. Took a walk. I got hungry.
FADE OUT: What was at the library?
FADE OUT: William O. Douglas. A man from this neck of the
FADE OUT: woods, and one of the great ministers of justice. I was
FADE OUT: seeking, inspiration and I found it there.
FADE OUT: Preparing your defense?
FADE OUT: Yes. Douglas said in times of trouble a man should
FADE OUT: immerse himself in wilderness. I'm going fishing.
FADE OUT: You know, Harry, somewhere between William
FADE OUT: Douglas and the Dalai Lama lies the perfect man.
FADE OUT: Their attention is drawn to Norma, angrily folding up all the tableclothes and dumping them
FADE OUT: in a box behind the counter.
FADE OUT: Norma appears to be quite upset this evening.
FADE OUT: That damn food critic finally wrote a review. Ran this
FADE OUT: afternoon in the Seattle paper.
FADE OUT: #2.010
FADE OUT: 24. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: That bad?
FADE OUT: To call it scathing would be kind.
FADE OUT: Cooper reaches for his check. Truman takes it.
FADE OUT: Let me. I'm the one who still has a paycheck.
FADE OUT: Harry, you're aces. Excuse me.
FADE OUT: Norma? You know what they say? A critic is a legless
FADE OUT: man who teaching running.
FADE OUT: Did you read it?
FADE OUT: It doesn't matter; you couldn't keep people out of here if
FADE OUT: you tried.
FADE OUT: You're very nice, to say so. Thanks.
FADE OUT: Harry, is it hunting season?
FADE OUT: Not unless they've switched months on the calender.
FADE OUT: Norma chews that over. Cooper and Truman exit.
FADE OUT: Harry, it's time to put that Green Butt Skunk to work.
FADE OUT: They exit, passing Vivian just entering. She moves to Norma at the cash register.
FADE OUT: What's happened to the tablecloths?
FADE OUT: The critic has spoken. I feel like a fool.
FADE OUT: Darling, pick your lower lip up off the floor. It wasn't
FADE OUT: that bad.
FADE OUT: #2.010
FADE OUT: 24. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: Mother, don't tell me how to feel. This business is all I
FADE OUT: have. I just want to keep my regular customers. I don't
FADE OUT: care if anyone else ever comes here again. And they won't;
FADE OUT: not after "if you're looking for local color stop in, but for
FADE OUT: good food - give this one a wide berth."
FADE OUT: It said "local charm," not color.
FADE OUT: What did you do, memorize the piece of crash?
FADE OUT: No. I wrote it.
FADE OUT: Pause.
FADE OUT: You might as well know so we can get this particular
FADE OUT: melodrama over with. M. T. Wentz, c'est moi.
FADE OUT: I can't belive it. Is that why you came to visit. To run
FADE OUT: me into the ground?
FADE OUT: Norma, darling, I wanted to write a good review, but it's
FADE OUT: just not a good restaurant. I can't violate my professional
FADE OUT: ethics -
FADE OUT: Ethics? I'm your daughter -
FADE OUT: Some standards have to prevail over -
FADE OUT: What about standards for common decency? Kindness?
FADE OUT: Or don't those fall within the standards of your
FADE OUT: "profession" -
FADE OUT: Of course they do -
FADE OUT: No, the proof's in the pudding. Even if you find it
FADE OUT: inedible. I wouldn't treat a dog like this, much less my
FADE OUT: own daughter.
FADE OUT: #2.010
FADE OUT: 24. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: As usual, you're over-reacting -
FADE OUT: Am I? Maybe I am. But it's my reaction. I'm the one
FADE OUT: who's hurt here and how I react is none of your damn
FADE OUT: business -
FADE OUT: Dear, be sensible -
FADE OUT: I am being sensible. Leave this place, now and get out of
FADE OUT: my life. I 'm not going to lei you hurt me anymore.
FADE OUT: Norma -
FADE OUT: Goodbye. Go.
FADE OUT: She stares at her. Vivian grows cold and leaves. Norma pours herself a cup of coffee. Tears
FADE OUT: fall, her hands shake, rattling the cup but she knows she turned a corner.
FADE OUT: 25. INT. ONE-EYED JACK'S - BLACKIE'S OFFICE - NIGHT
FADE OUT: Hank and Ernie, still in hunting attire with rifles, are escorted in by a couple of PICK-UPS.
FADE OUT: Thanks, kids. We'll take it from here.
FADE OUT: Bagged our limit today, Ern, without firing a shot.
FADE OUT: Welcome to the Fun Zone.
FADE OUT: I'll remind you I'm a married man. Recently married.
FADE OUT: To an extremely wealthy woman. And as we discussed
FADE OUT: we're real eager to get into business with you -
FADE OUT: I will not steal my wife's money!
FADE OUT: Stealing? Who said anything about stealing? You're the
FADE OUT: computer whiz, old buddy, hit the keyboard, she won't
FADE OUT: #2.010 Revised 10-22-90 CHERRY

FADE OUT: even see a ripple in the pond. Look at it this way, Ernie,
FADE OUT: if you don't help us, how long do you think she's going to
FADE OUT: be your wife?
FADE OUT: Vivian will throw you out of the house, then my partner
FADE OUT: will kill you. So I suggest you get with the program,
FADE OUT: pal.
FADE OUT: Jean enters silently. He looks at Ernie, not liking what he sees.
FADE OUT: This is him?
FADE OUT: Ernie, meet Jean Renault. Met him in the woods one
FADE OUT: night when he stuck a gun in my ear. Lucky for me I had
FADE OUT: my state prosecutor's badge with me. Don't leave home
FADE OUT: without it.
FADE OUT: Jean, this is the Professor. What he can do with numbers
FADE OUT: could make a thousand dollar hooker blush like a nun.
FADE OUT: A recent investment opportunity fell through, leaving us
FADE OUT: in a cash-poor position. We need $125,000. Immediately.
FADE OUT: I understand completely.
FADE OUT: Do you, Professor?
FADE OUT: This, this will not be difficult. Just so you know a little
FADE OUT: bit more about me, I've been associated with a number
FADE OUT: of the most prestigious financial institutions in the
FADE OUT: country; I've laundered massive amounts of money, I've
FADE OUT: brokered tremendously large deals for the Columbian
FADE OUT: and Bolivian industries. In other words, I'm wired in.
FADE OUT: Hard-wired I'm your man. Definitely. Definitely your
FADE OUT: man.

FADE OUT: 33A.
FADE OUT: 25. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: You said the magic words.
FADE OUT: Jean turns around and walks out. Ernie looks at Hank - is this it, I'm a goner?
FADE OUT: Nicely done, Ernie. Are you making this up?
FADE OUT: #2.010 Revised 10-5-90, PINK
FADE OUT: 25. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: No, no, no, no.
FADE OUT: Jean returns, bringing with him Sergeant King, the Mountie, now in civilian dress. He carries a
FADE OUT: briefcase.
FADE OUT: The Professor. Our new broker.
FADE OUT: The Mountie lays out his briefcase, opens it, revealing multiple KILOS of COCAINE.
FADE OUT: Ernie's eyes bug out. Hank pats him on the back.
FADE OUT: You can handle this puny little load, can't you Ernie?
FADE OUT: He'll take care of it for us - won't you Professor?
FADE OUT: Yes. Yes, yes, yes.
FADE OUT: Hank, take the Professor down to the tables. I understand
FADE OUT: you have quite a system; roulette, craps. Very scientific.
FADE OUT: I did, I used to, I don't, I don't gamble anymore.
FADE OUT: We're all gamblers here, Professor. Enjoy life.
FADE OUT: A nod to Hank, who quickly ushers Ernie out.
FADE OUT: I don't like the look of him.
FADE OUT: We'll see, won't we?
FADE OUT: Four for us, one to put the last nail in Cooper's coffin.
FADE OUT: I'll call you when it's done.
FADE OUT: #2.010
FADE OUT: 25. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: Where will you put it?
FADE OUT: His car. We won't need much. A trace.
FADE OUT: I want him crucified.
FADE OUT: The Mountie nods. Exits. Stay on jean.
FADE OUT: 26. EXT. HARRY TRUMAN'S LOG CABIN HOUSE - NIGHT
FADE OUT: 27. INT. HARRY TRUMAN'S - NIGHT
FADE OUT: A SOUND outside. Truman sits bolt up right in bed. He listens. Hears footsteps. He takes
FADE OUT: his pistol from the holster hanging on the headboard, moves cautiously towards the door in the
FADE OUT: darkness. He sees a shadow of movement outside the window against a curtain. Then a rattle
FADE OUT: at the door, someone trying the handle.
FADE OUT: Hefting the gun, Truman moves to the door, stands to the side, then pulls the door open
FADE OUT: inwards. JOSIE PACKARD falls into the room, into his arms. She's exhausted, faint, a
FADE OUT: wound on her forehead.
FADE OUT: Josie ...
FADE OUT: Help me ...
FADE OUT: She slips into unconsciousness. He holds her.
FADE OUT: 13. EXT. CAMPSITE - NIGHT
FADE OUT: Surrounded by towering Douglas Firs, Cooper and Major Briggs sit by their campfire -
FADE OUT: putting MARSHMALLOWS on sticks. FISHING GEAR dries against a tree. The remains
FADE OUT: of their dinner, TROUT BONES and HEADS, lay on tin plates.
FADE OUT: Major this is a fascinating concept. The other side of
FADE OUT: love is not hate - but fear?
FADE OUT: #2.010
FADE OUT: 28. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: Absolutely. And fear is the absence of love.
FADE OUT: For yourself as well.
FADE OUT: All perceptions or conditions must begin with the self.
FADE OUT: They put their marshmallows over the fire.
FADE OUT: So when I let fear into my life, I'm not loving myself.
FADE OUT: You are in direct contradiction to a state of loving
FADE OUT: acceptance; incapable of it. Direct denial.
FADE OUT: Major Briggs, if I may ask a personal question ... do you
FADE OUT: love yourself?
FADE OUT: Very much.
FADE OUT: Cooper's fascinated. He rotates his marshmallow in the fire.
FADE OUT: Then it stands to reason that Leland Palmer didn't.
FADE OUT: One could draw that conclusion. There are powerful
FADE OUT: forces of evil in the world. It is some men's fate to
FADE OUT: confront great darkness. We each choose how to react. If
FADE OUT: the choice is fear, then we become vulnerable to darkness.
FADE OUT: Cooper looks around, at the literal darkness surrounding him.
FADE OUT: Tomorrow I face my own demons, Major Briggs. But,
FADE OUT: thanks to you, I believe I will do so without fear. I
FADE OUT: carefully considered my actions before proceeding. I
FADE OUT: went forward. I must accept the consequences.
FADE OUT: You can do no more.
FADE OUT: An owl hoots somewhere in the woods. They look for it. A reflective pause.
FADE OUT: #2.010
FADE OUT: 23. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: Major, I think about "Bob." If he truly exists.
FADE OUT: I have pondered the some question continuously since this
FADE OUT: horror was revealed to us.
FADE OUT: I try to imagine him, "it", out there somewhere, lurking.
FADE OUT: Searching for prey. Terrible.
FADE OUT: Yes. But remember, we have a choice; to think about it in
FADE OUT: that way, to fear it, imparts power to evil. There are ways
FADE OUT: to resist. You, Sir, are blessed with certain gifts. In this
FADE OUT: respect you are not alone. Have you ever heard of the
FADE OUT: White Lodge?
FADE OUT: The White Lodge. No.
FADE OUT: Excuse me, mine is now seared to perfection.
FADE OUT: Briggs pops the whole blackened marshmallow into his mouth. Cooper rises.
FADE OUT: I'll be right back, Major. Call of nature. There's nothing
FADE OUT: quite like urinating in the open air. I look forward to
FADE OUT: hearing about the White Lodge.
FADE OUT: The Major, his mouth full, gives a "thumbs up."
FADE OUT: 29. EXT. WOODS - NIGHT
FADE OUT: Cooper moves behind a tree to urinate. An OWL SCREECHES.
FADE OUT: ON THE TREE BRANCHES above him, two luminous EYES shine out of the darkness.
FADE OUT: Cooper heads back to camp. There's another OWL SCREECH - much louder, more chilling.
FADE OUT: And between him and campsite, a flash of WHITE LIGHT.
INTERCUT: 
INTERCUT: 30. MAJOR BRIGGS
INTERCUT: Looking into the white light - surrounding a TALL, DARK, CLOAKED FIGURE, face
INTERCUT: obscured by a cowled hood.
INTERCUT: #2.010 Revised 10-12-90, YELLOW
INTERCUT: 30. CONTINUED:
INTERCUT: Cooper!
INTERCUT: Cooper hurries back to camp, fighting fear with every step.
INTERCUT: Major? Major Briggs?
INTERCUT: He stops. A new marshmallow is on Briggs' stick, laying in the fire. The MARSHMALLOW
INTERCUT: IGNITES. Briggs is gone. Cooper looks up, past the fire, toward the white light that first
INTERCUT: drew the Major's attention.
INTERCUT: MAJOR?
INTERCUT: Cooper runs toward the light, up a dark hill. But as he nears it, the light suddenly goes out.
INTERCUT: HOLD ON Cooper for a beat.
FADE OUT: 
FADE OUT: THE END
