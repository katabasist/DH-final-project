REVISED: #2.005
REVISED: 1. EXT. GREAT NORTHERN HOTEL - MORNING
REVISED: 2. INT. COOPER'S HOTEL ROOM - MORNING
REVISED: COOPER sits on the edge of the bed in his boxer shorts. Flips on his tape recorder.
REVISED: Diane, it's 6:42 a.m., a bit of a late start, due to a
REVISED: persisting soreness in the rib area ...
REVISED: An ache that feels as if a wing were cut away in my
REVISED: sleep.
REVISED: Diane, a strange dream to report: I dreamt I was
REVISED: eating a large, tasteless gumdrop. I soon awoke to
REVISED: realize I was aggressively munching on one of my
REVISED: Air-Pillow Silicon Ear Plugs. Hence the
REVISED: tastelessness. I suspect some unexpressed feeling of
REVISED: aggression is responsible.
REVISED: Diane, rather than equilibrate through the use of my
REVISED: gravity boots, which could induce further rib
REVISED: separation, this morning I'm going to attempt a
REVISED: headstand.
REVISED: I'm now upside down, my mind becoming porous,
REVISED: the day tasks coming into focus, objects growing
REVISED: clearer ...
REVISED: Looking out in the darkness of the stained wood floor, which now looks to us like the ceiling.
REVISED: Cooper sees a white envelope under, or rather over, the bed. Cooper unfurls and reaches for
REVISED: it.
REVISED: "My special agent ..."
REVISED: Diane, the Giant was right. I did forget something
REVISED: He opens the envelope, pulls out the card and reads Audrey's lost note.
REVISED: 3. EXT. SHERIFF'S STATION - MORNING
REVISED: #2.005
REVISED: 4. OMITTED
REVISED: 5. INT. SHERIFF'S STATION RECEPTION AREA
REVISED: HAWK enters, encountering HARRY TRUMAN, who awaits Cooper's arrival.
REVISED: I was afraid we lost you to the Kalispell woods.
REVISED: A pair of retired female schoolteachers lived in that
REVISED: house next to the Palmers. The name's not
REVISED: Robertson and they had no memory of a greyhaired
REVISED: man. Had to drink three pots of camomile tea to
REVISED: find that out.
REVISED: #2.005
REVISED: 5. CONTINUED:
REVISED: All right. The one-armed man's come back into the
REVISED: picture. Take a look, so far we've struck out.
REVISED: LUCY MORAN walks up carrying a day bag and looking a little teary-eyed.
REVISED: Excuse me, Sheriff, I'm sorry to interrupt, but
REVISED: Sheriff, I just wanted to say goodbye because as you
REVISED: know, I'm going down to Tacoma for two days to
REVISED: visit my sister, Gwen and her husband, Larry, who
REVISED: had a baby last week, you remember, it was a boy
REVISED: and as soon as the Can Do temp girl gets here I'll
REVISED: explain the phones and the coffee and the intercom
REVISED: and the Wagon Wheel Do-Nut run and ... and ...
REVISED: Lucy. It's okay.
REVISED: No, she should have been here by now, I can wait and
REVISED: at least show her ... show her ...
REVISED: Lucy. Go.
REVISED: With silent gratitude, she picks up her bag and exits ahead of Hawk. Cooper then enters,
REVISED: eyes cool, intently ablaze. Both he and Truman instinctively step toward an empty corridor.
REVISED: Harry -
REVISED: 'You get word on our delivery tonight?
REVISED: We won't need it. We've got the jump on them.
REVISED: I know where Audrey is.
REVISED: 6. EXT. LEO JOHNSON'S HOUSE - DAY
REVISED: #2.005
REVISED: 7. INT. LEO JOHNSON'S LIVING ROOM - DAY
REVISED: A hospital bed has replaced the living room sofa. In a wheelchair beside the bed sits BOBBY
REVISED: BRIGGS, allowing the medical supplies salesman, TIM PINKLE, to demonstrate a lifting
REVISED: apparatus. Pinkle is a pasty, perspiration-prone man with an affectation of high duty.
REVISED: SHELLY JOHNSON stands a step removed, looking on.
REVISED: The Port-O-Patient will allow you to fluently
REVISED: transport the unfortunate Mr. Johnson, allowing him
REVISED: even to sit outside and experience what he can of
REVISED: nature.
REVISED: Mr. Pinkle, I want my cousin Leo to have the fullest
REVISED: possible experience of life.
REVISED: That's what we're here for. Let's take
REVISED: Pinkle inspects the electrical engine that, along with the rest of the host, looks to be quite
REVISED: antiquated. Bobby sits in the loose body sling connected to an overhead bar by two sagging
REVISED: crossing chains, giving this crane-like device the look of a silvery praying mantis.
REVISED: Mr. Pinkle are you going to put in a ramp.
REVISED: Ah... sure. I've got some plywood, uh, pinewood
REVISED: ramp boards I'll install outside. Absolutely.
REVISED: Pinkle finds the switch to start the engine.
REVISED: Okay, here we go.
REVISED: He flips the switch. Nothing happens.
REVISED: That's a new wrinkle. It was working the other day.
REVISED: Pinkle fiddles with the cord to the socket. Nothing. Suddenly the engine starts. The bar jerks
REVISED: up and the chains snap tight across a frightened Bobby, who's yanked up from his seat and
REVISED: tossed back down. Then the machine stops. Flashing Pinkle a homicidal look, Bobby fights his
REVISED: way out of the chains, sling, and chair.
REVISED: Bobby, 'you alright?
REVISED: #2.005
REVISED: 7. CONTINUED:
REVISED: How about getting Mr. Pinkle a cold drink?
REVISED: As Shelly leaves, Bobby pulls Pinkle aside by the back of his neck.
REVISED: That thing's a death trap, Pinkle. I told you we have
REVISED: to keep him alive.
REVISED: Insurance companies don't exactly pay off like the
REVISED: slots. After both our cuts, it was either this or a first-
REVISED: rate wheelbarrow.
REVISED: Shelly returns. Pinkle takes the soda and dives into tinkering with the machine.
REVISED: Bobby?
REVISED: I've got to meet Leo's lawyer.
REVISED: The hearing's today, right?
REVISED: Be just another second, folks.
REVISED: Bobby, are we okay?
REVISED: His response is a passionate stare. She smolders back. With Pinkle about, they can do no
REVISED: more than look and want. But outside ... Bobby takes her hand.
REVISED: Come on, he can let himself out.
REVISED: They exit. Pinkle, studies the non-working hoist. After a moment he climbs up into the sling.
REVISED: Testing. He shouts back to Bobby.
REVISED: Probably a short in the switch.
REVISED: Pinkle reaches down and hits the switch a couple of time; finally, the bar lifts, the chains
REVISED: tighten and the salesman rises.
REVISED: There we go ...
REVISED: #2:005
REVISED: 7. CONTINUED:
REVISED: But the machine doesn't stop, lifting Pinkle up to a precarious height and pulling him back,
REVISED: his arms pinned by the crossing chains.
REVISED: Hit that switch down there, would you, Bobby?
REVISED: Bobby? ... Bobby?
REVISED: 8. EXT. ROADHOUSE - DAY
REVISED: 9. INT. ROADHOUSE - DAY
REVISED: The entry doors have been closed, the tables pushed against the front wall. Two rows of
REVISED: chairs face a long, solid judge's table at the back of the room. Andy escorts Leland past
REVISED: Cooper and Truman, standing near the door, to a defendant's table in the front row. The
REVISED: prosecutor's table sits alongside, SARAH PALMER and MADDY FERGUSON sit behind
REVISED: Leland in the second row, along with a few habitual COURT WITNESSES. Leland takes
REVISED: Sarah's hand for a moment.
REVISED: The small group stands as JUDGE CLINTON STERNWOOD, all in shining black robes,
REVISED: strides expansively into the room; a rich, magisterial presence and powerful, uncluttered
REVISED: eyes. His trailed by SID, his bailiff. Appraising the prosecutorless situation, Sternwood stops
REVISED: beside Cooper and Truman.
REVISED: Morning. Where's Lodwick the prosecutor?
REVISED: Hasn't shown.
REVISED: Took a long constitutional this morning. The path
REVISED: leading down to the waterfall. A fine, invigorating
REVISED: mist in the air. There was a twelve-point buck
REVISED: drinking from the pool; he saw me but didn't bolt.
REVISED: Time stood still. I In the presence of the eternal, I
REVISED: suppose that's as it should be.
REVISED: #2.005
REVISED: 9. CONTINUED!
REVISED: BEN HORNE has entered, late, immediately makes his way to the power in the room.
REVISED: Benjamin.
REVISED: Your Honor, a pleasure, sorry I missed you last night.
REVISED: Your dining room served a wild boar with a cherry
REVISED: sauce that I haven't yet found the words to describe.
REVISED: I've been around the Great Northern since the dawn
REVISED: of man. Hammered my way through law school
REVISED: there.
REVISED: Clinton worked construction for my father. In my
REVISED: boyhood memory he built half the hotel single-
REVISED: handedly.
REVISED: There's a door near my room, opening out to the
REVISED: back, that's like nothing I've ever seen. Two panel
REVISED: oak, all joined with tongues, tenons, and dowels.
REVISED: Not a nail or a screw in it.
REVISED: Thank you. I remember that door. Dryclamped and
REVISED: lying in the sun. Beautiful piece of work -
REVISED: DARRYL LODWICK, the state prosecutor, arrives, apologetically approaching Sternwood.
REVISED: Sorry, I had a bit of trouble. Lost my wallet.
REVISED: Enter the State.
REVISED: #2.005
REVISED: 10. INT. ROADHOUSE - DAY
REVISED: Sitting alone and imposing at his long table, Sternwood GAVELS and commences.
REVISED: Mr. Palmer has pleaded not guilty to the charge of
REVISED: murder in the first degree. Defense has requested
REVISED: bail. This is a pretrial hearing to determine if that
REVISED: bail will be granted. Mr. Prosecutor ...
REVISED: We, the people of the state of Washington, move that
REVISED: the defendant be denied bail on the basis of: 1)the
REVISED: great seriousness of the crime for which he's been
REVISED: accused; 2) the apparently premeditated nature of
REVISED: this act; and 3) the oft-witnessed instability of Mr.
REVISED: Palmer during the period following the death of his
REVISED: daughter.
REVISED: All eyes are on Leland as Lodwick sits.
REVISED: Sheriff Truman will speak for the defense.
REVISED: Mr. Palmer is a well-known, respected member of
REVISED: this community, with a good professional reputation
REVISED: and established roots. And beyond that ... I'd like
REVISED: to say that none of us can really know what it's like to
REVISED: lose a seventeen year-old daughter the way he did.
REVISED: What that might do to any one of us ...
REVISED: That's all.
REVISED: Sternwood deliberates. Truman takes his seat beside Andy, who is glancing up and over a
REVISED: row up at Leland's partial profile. Truman glances down at the sketchpad in Andy's lap and
REVISED: sees ...
REVISED: Andy's sketch of Leland, from the same angle as just seen by Truman: a profile favoring the
REVISED: back left side of the head.
REVISED: Andy notices Truman's attention.
REVISED: I thought I might sell this to the Gazette. They
REVISED: seem to like courtroom sketches.
REVISED: You might try for a little more of his face. Just a
REVISED: suggestion.
REVISED: #2.005
REVISED: 10. CONTINUED:
REVISED: Good. Thanks, Sheriff.
REVISED: Sternwood gavels.
REVISED: On the basis of his high standing in the community,
REVISED: the pristine nature of his public and private
REVISED: reputation and his evident respect for the letter of the
REVISED: law, which is well known to me ... defendant is
REVISED: released on his own recognizance. Leland, as you
REVISED: know, I'll require you to remain in town, making
REVISED: your whereabouts known to the Sheriff on a regular
REVISED: basis. Sid, check the calendar. We'll set the date for
REVISED: Mr. Palmer's trial.
REVISED: Reactions all round: for Leland, a shred of dignity retained.
REVISED: 11. EXT. HAROLD SMITH'S APARTMENT - DAY
REVISED: 12. INT. HAROLD SMITH'S APARTMENT - DAY
REVISED: HAROLD SMITH leads DONNA HAYWARD in, sits behind his mahogany desk. DONNA
REVISED: HAYWARD sits in the antique chair opposite.
REVISED: So, what behind those deep blue eyes today?
REVISED: I've got a proposition for you.
REVISED: Now you've got my attention.
REVISED: I'll share my fife with you. I'll tell it to you. Be a
REVISED: part, of your living novel ...
REVISED: If I can read Laura's diary.
REVISED: Intriguing.
REVISED: I'll read it to you, It mustn't physically leave this
REVISED: room.
REVISED: #2.005
REVISED: 12. CONTINUED:
REVISED: Acceptable.
REVISED: You'll start?
REVISED: Acceptable.
REVISED: Harold undoes the secret bookshelf. Donna tries not to make an obvious point of observing.
REVISED: He tries to casually conceal the fact he's concealing how the locking mechanism works. He
REVISED: takes out a fresh ledger, lays Laura's diary on the desk beside him, makes a show of taking
REVISED: out an expensive fountain pen and cracks open the new book.
REVISED: Donna ... Hayward.
REVISED: Begin ...
REVISED: Alright. I'm from Twin Peaks. That is I was born
REVISED: here. My father delivered me. He's a doctor.
REVISED: Where are you from?
REVISED: I grew up in Boston. Actually, I grew up in books.
REVISED: There are things you can't get from books.
REVISED: There are things you can't get anywhere. But we
REVISED: dream they can be found in other people. Continue.
REVISED: Donna stands, comes over to the desk coquettishly along its edge.
REVISED: Maybe our dreams are real.
REVISED: Harold nervously pull back. Donna quickly grabs Laura's diary and playfully steps away.
REVISED: #2.005
REVISED: 12. CONTINUED:
REVISED: My turn ...
REVISED: No, we've only just started. Please.
REVISED: He steps towards her. Donna mischievously throws open the front door.
REVISED: Maybe I'll read it out here on the lawn.
REVISED: Give that back to me, please.
REVISED: Why don't you come out with me? Come on.
REVISED: What's there to be afraid of?
REVISED: She backs through the open doorway. He bolts forward; but suddenly it's as if she's backed
REVISED: over a cliff. His face flushes at the flood of daylight. A trembling ignites in his fingers.
REVISED: Oh God ... oh God ...
REVISED: Harold?
REVISED: He gets down on the ground, hyperventilating, looking almost paralyzed.
REVISED: DONNA .
REVISED: Harold?
REVISED: His breathing locks. She hurries to him, kneels down, half-props him against her chest, he
REVISED: grasps at her, trying to breathe again.
REVISED: It's all right. It's all right. I'm so sorry.
REVISED: I just ... I just got too close.
REVISED: To what?
REVISED: As his panic fades, seeking and finding permission in her eyes, he kisses her tenderly. They
REVISED: look at each other.
FADE OUT: 
FADE OUT: #2.005
FADE OUT: 13. INT. ROADHOUSE - DAY
FADE OUT: Leo Johnson competency hearing. Judge Sternwood is holding court, facing Prosecutor
FADE OUT: Lodwick and JACK RACINE, a sardonic defense attorney representing Leo Johnson.
FADE OUT: We begin CLOSE ON a blown-up photograph of Leo Johnson, before and after injury and a
FADE OUT: diagram on an easel Racine is showing to the judge and closeby gallery area, occupied by
FADE OUT: Cooper, Truman, and Shelly Johnson. The diagram is of two EEG waves, one large and
FADE OUT: varied, the other flat and undisclosing.
FADE OUT: You can see by these EEG's, the one above, which is
FADE OUT: actually of my own head and intended to show
FADE OUT: normal brain activity . The line below is of Mr.
FADE OUT: Johnson and shows minimal activity. The previously
FADE OUT: submitted medical report states that Mr. Johnson has
FADE OUT: suffered diffuse brain damage. He isn't currently
FADE OUT: even capable of taking the standard CST
FADE OUT: competency tests. We therefore submit that trying
FADE OUT: this individual would constitute a mockery of the
FADE OUT: justice system, a proceeding the unfortunate young
FADE OUT: man wold not even faintly comprehend.
FADE OUT: Racine withdraws.
FADE OUT: Mr. Prosecutor.
FADE OUT: Lodwick stands, takes a posturing step toward an almost empty gallery, and accidentally
FADE OUT: makes eye contact with Shelly Johnson before folding back toward the judge.
FADE OUT: I know that Leo Johnson isn't in very good shape. On
FADE OUT: the surface, it might seem ridiculous to make him
FADE OUT: stand trial. But a trial doesn't just punish a
FADE OUT: wrongdoer; it also brings a feeling of justice and
FADE OUT: retribution to a community. Among the various
FADE OUT: crimes he's suspected of, the murder of Laura Palmer
FADE OUT: is the sort that can wound an entire town.
FADE OUT: #2.005
FADE OUT: 13. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: For there to be even a shred of feeling that the
FADE OUT: perpetrator of this terrible crime got away with it -
FADE OUT: - this simply cannot be. As long as Leo Johnson
FADE OUT: carries a breath, he is as eminently deserving of a
FADE OUT: trial as this community is of a resolution -
FADE OUT: All right, have a seat, Mr. Lodwick. You fellas catch
FADE OUT: your breath, I'm going to need to deliberate.
FADE OUT: Mr. Cooper, Sheriff Truman if I could have the
FADE OUT: pleasure of your company ...
FADE OUT: Sternwood waves them over to join him at the bar.
FADE OUT: Sid, how about fixing me up a Black Yukon on Sucker
FADE OUT: Punch?
FADE OUT: Sid contentedly goes to work behind the bar, concocting an elaborate drink. Cooper and
FADE OUT: Truman flank Sternwood at the bar.
FADE OUT: Lodwick really planted his feet and looked it in the
FADE OUT: eye. I didn't think he'd press on the murder charge.
FADE OUT: Is Leo Johnson your man?
FADE OUT: No, sir, I don't believe he is.
FADE OUT: Harry, what's the town's temperature? Do they want
FADE OUT: a trial or a lynching?
FADE OUT: They want the right man brought to justice.
FADE OUT: Then they don't a need a circus. This poor bastard
FADE OUT: seems to be a head of cabbage. Thoughts, Cooper?
FADE OUT: I feel the right man will eventually be apprehended.
FADE OUT: Sid brings Sternwood his drink. With full ritualistic relish, Sternwood lights a cigar. Looks
FADE OUT: #2.005
FADE OUT: 13. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: over at Shelly, sitting alone, looking small.
FADE OUT: I declare Leo Johnson not competent to stand trial.
FADE OUT: When medically possible, he may be sent home.
FADE OUT: Harry, maybe you'd like to tell the little lady
FADE OUT: yourself.
FADE OUT: Truman nods gratefully, moves to Shelly.
FADE OUT: How long you been here, Cooper?
FADE OUT: Close to two weeks, sir.
FADE OUT: I'll advise you to keep your eye on the woods. The
FADE OUT: woods are wondrous here. But strange.
FADE OUT: Sternwood drinks his drink, his eye on some distant, sinister horizon. Truman kneels down
FADE OUT: beside Shelly, who, distracted, doesn't notice him at first.
FADE OUT: Shelly? They're not going to try him.
FADE OUT: Her silent, complex response.
FADE OUT: Leo's coming home.
FADE OUT: A beat. Shelly's face seems to ask, who is really being sentenced?
FADE OUT: 14. EXT. ED HURLEY'S HOUSE
FADE OUT: 15. INT. HURLEY'S LIVING ROOM
FADE OUT: JAMES HURLEY waits inside the open front door. NADINE, with ED behind her, enters
FADE OUT: entranced and confused in the doorlight. James moves to her.
FADE OUT: Can I get you anything, Nadine?
FADE OUT: #2.005
FADE OUT: 15. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: who are you?
FADE OUT: Who am I?
FADE OUT: From behind her, Ed rolls his eyes in explanation of the fact that there is no explanation, and
FADE OUT: that this is pretty standard behavior. Nadine suddenly grins in recognition.
FADE OUT: You go to the high school.
FADE OUT: Well ... yeah.
FADE OUT: It took me a second. You're not in any of my classes.
FADE OUT: Ed or no Ed, James is knocked over.
FADE OUT: Why don't you sit, honey and I'll get you a drink.
FADE OUT: No, I'll get it.
FADE OUT: Where are mom and dad?
FADE OUT: They're ... out of town.
FADE OUT: Oh. Okay.
FADE OUT: She goes into the kitchen.
FADE OUT: Wow.
FADE OUT: Doc said to roll with the punches, James.
FADE OUT: What about Jacoby? Why don't you take her to see
FADE OUT: him?
FADE OUT: #2.005
FADE OUT: 15. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: He's in Hawaii, recovering from that heart attack.
FADE OUT: Agent Cooper said I should talk to someone about
FADE OUT: ... what's been going on. Laura. And Donna. And
FADE OUT: Maddy ...
FADE OUT: Donna's a good girl, James. Her kind are pretty rare.
FADE OUT: I'm just so damned confused ...
FADE OUT: Confused?
FADE OUT: A sudden RIPPING SOUND from the kitchen. Ed and James trade looks.
FADE OUT: James, I'm a little confused myself.
FADE OUT: Nadine, shocked, steps into the living room entranceway; in one hand she is gripping, by
FADE OUT: its handle, a refrigerator freezer door.
FADE OUT: It just came right off.
FADE OUT: 16. EXT. GREAT NORTHERN HOTEL - DAY
FADE OUT: 17. INT. BEN HORNE'S OFFICE - DAY
FADE OUT: BEN HORNE enters carrying a black briefcase.
FADE OUT: Mr. Tojamura is here.
FADE OUT: Mr. Who?
FADE OUT: Ben looks up to see an ASIAN GENTLEMAN, dressed in a loose-fitting dark suit and
FADE OUT: sunglasses, step crisply toward the guest chair and unhesitatingly take a seat. An impeccably
FADE OUT: dressed VALET trails behind him. Ben puts the briefcase behind his desk.
FADE OUT: #2.005
FADE OUT: 17. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: Excuse me? Did you have an appointment, Mr. ... ?
FADE OUT: Tojamura. I represent Asian investment firm. We
FADE OUT: have superior offer for Ghostwood Project.
FADE OUT: Revolutionize Northwest tourism. We have
FADE OUT: commitment letters from Tokyo banks. Prepared
FADE OUT: to move immediately.
FADE OUT: I'm sure this all sounds very interesting, I
FADE OUT: unfortunately have a very important conference call in
FADE OUT: a couple of minutes...
FADE OUT: Here is prospectus ...
FADE OUT: Perhaps another time, Mr. uh ...
FADE OUT: And taste.
FADE OUT: The valet hands Tojamura a check. He pushes it across the desktop.
FADE OUT: Five.
FADE OUT: ... million.
FADE OUT: He picks up the prospectus with renewed interest.
FADE OUT: 18. INT. GREAT NORTHERN CORRIDOR - DAY
FADE OUT: HANK walks in and heads immediately for Ben's office. BOBBY enters at a safe distance and
FADE OUT: watches Hank disappear down the hallway. Cooper enters moments later.
FADE OUT: 19. INT. BEN HORNE'S OFFICE - DAY
FADE OUT: Seeing Tojamura to the door.
FADE OUT: I want you to leave all this with me and let my
FADE OUT: people take a look at it.
FADE OUT: #2.005
FADE OUT: 19. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: Point of visit.
FADE OUT: Hank enters, stops when he sees Tojamura. Ben waves Hank back. Tojamura bows to Ben.
FADE OUT: Ben bows back.
FADE OUT: Look forward to further discussion.
FADE OUT: Arrigato, Tojamura san.
FADE OUT: Tojamura exits. Hank watches him go.
FADE OUT: Cooper's on way his in.
FADE OUT: The phone starts to ring. Ben looks at his watch, waves Hank towards the inner office door.
FADE OUT: Hank disappears, an instant before Cooper enters the office.
FADE OUT: You, pushed it pretty close.
FADE OUT: Is that our call?
FADE OUT: Exactly as we discussed.
FADE OUT: Ben nods, picks up and puts it on the speaker phone.
FADE OUT: Benjamin Horne.
FADE OUT: JEAN RENAULT'S VOICE
FADE OUT: Are you ready to play?
FADE OUT: Let me speak to my daughter.
FADE OUT: RENAULT'S VOICE
FADE OUT: That can wait til tonight. One time:
FADE OUT: ... across the border, five miles east of Grand Forks
FADE OUT: on the road to Castlegars, is a bar called the
FADE OUT: Columbian. Behind it is a failed amusement park.
FADE OUT: Go to the merry-go-round. Leave the briefcase
FADE OUT: beside the horse with no head. At midnight. Alone.
FADE OUT: #2.005
FADE OUT: 19. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: Midnight.
FADE OUT: And you'll of course have Audrey there with you ...
FADE OUT: I'll ... I'll be sending my representative -
FADE OUT: The line goes dead on Ben. He puts down the phone and opens the briefcase. Cooper scans
FADE OUT: the money.
FADE OUT: Serialized denominations. As you instructed.
FADE OUT: Cooper closes the case and takes it in hand.
FADE OUT: My daughter's life is in your hands.
FADE OUT: I'll bring her back. Stay by a phone.
FADE OUT: Cooper exits. A moment on Ben. Hank comes out of inner office.
FADE OUT: Follow him. Make sure that he and the money are
FADE OUT: neatly delivered. Bring Audrey back.
FADE OUT: Cooper's not bringing her back?
FADE OUT: Cooper's not coming back. And if you can manage
FADE OUT: it ... bring back Audrey and the briefcase.
FADE OUT: Already on the wavelength, Hank nods, steps back into the blackness of the hallway.

FADE OUT: 20. INT. DOUBLE R - NIGHT
FADE OUT: Donna and Maddy sit at the dining table with a homemade drawing of the floor plan of
FADE OUT: Harold Smith's Apartment between them. Two pocket flashlights sit on the table.
FADE OUT: Once you're in the Harold's apartment you have to go
FADE OUT: as fast as you can.
FADE OUT: This is scary.
FADE OUT: This is for Laura.
FADE OUT: Her diary is in a secret shelf at the very bottom of
FADE OUT: the bookcase behind a row of fake books. There's a
FADE OUT: doohickey on the right hand side of the bookshelf,
FADE OUT: when you pull it out you can slide the secret shelf out.
FADE OUT: All of the notebooks in there look the same, except
FADE OUT: for Laura's. It's smaller. has a red cover -
FADE OUT: How are you going to get him to go outside?
FADE OUT: Not outside. Just out of the front room.
FADE OUT: I'll signal you through the window. The door will
FADE OUT: be open.
FADE OUT: I thought you liked this guy?
FADE OUT: I do like him.
FADE OUT: Doesn't it make you feel a little weird, stealing
FADE OUT: from him?
FADE OUT: Look, if there's nothing in that diary we'll give it
FADE OUT: back to him. But we have to know.
FADE OUT: And if there isn't, do you think you'd still want to
FADE OUT: #2.005
FADE OUT: 20. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: see him?
FADE OUT: Yes. I like him. A lot.
FADE OUT: A beat. Maddy smiles.

FADE OUT: They laugh quietly.
FADE OUT: Right.

FADE OUT: the elbow. BLACKIE watches.
FADE OUT: Cooper hands me the briefcase. I take it.
FADE OUT: Renault thrusts out his forearm as if to take a briefcase. With a distinct sound, the knife
FADE OUT: whistles down the chute and bolts to a stop well past the hand area, a show of gleaming,
FADE OUT: finest-cut steel blade.
FADE OUT: What about Ben Horne?
FADE OUT: He relinquishes control of Jack's. It's all yours.
FADE OUT: With his daughter dead?
FADE OUT: You love a good steak, but you don't want to know
FADE OUT: how it got on your plate.
FADE OUT: With Battis gone and Home out of the way, you're
FADE OUT: going to have to get serious about your business,
FADE OUT: Blackie.
FADE OUT: How are you going to do the girl?
FADE OUT: Renault motions to a syringe, drugs and chemistry set on his desk. Blackie moves seductively
FADE OUT: towards Renault, with an eye on the drugs.
FADE OUT: #2.005

FADE OUT: Is it my turn to play?

FADE OUT: In the other room.
FADE OUT: Blackie exits.
FADE OUT: The girl asleep?
FADE OUT: Dreamland.
FADE OUT: Does she dream of fishes? Of dark lake beds and
FADE OUT: tangled weeds?
FADE OUT: Renault caresses her leg, pulls a knife from her boot. Nancy doesn't move.
FADE OUT: What about Blackie? I've waited long enough.
FADE OUT: We'll have our fun tonight.
FADE OUT: Renault caresses her with the knife.

FADE OUT: #2.005
FADE OUT: 25. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: Is she feeling stronger?
FADE OUT: Yeah. She tore the freezer door right off the
FADE OUT: refrigerator.
FADE OUT: Was she mad about something?
FADE OUT: No. She was happy.
FADE OUT: The front door opens. TOJAMURA enters. Norma freezes. Tojamura nods.
FADE OUT: Dinner for one?
FADE OUT: Tojamura, nods again. Norma shows him to a booth facing the front window and hands him
FADE OUT: a newly calligraphic menu. Maddy hurries into the diner. Stops short when she sees James.
FADE OUT: Tries to look past him looking for a waitress
FADE OUT: Hi.
FADE OUT: Hi.
FADE OUT: Can I get a coffee to go?
FADE OUT: Seen Donna today?
FADE OUT: No, sorry. You?
FADE OUT: No. What's with the coffee?
FADE OUT: Coffee? It's for Uncle Leland.
FADE OUT: You don't have coffee at home?
FADE OUT: James, I can't talk now. I need to go.
FADE OUT: #2.005
FADE OUT: 25. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: You need to go?
FADE OUT: Where are you going?
FADE OUT: Home. Bye, James.
FADE OUT: Maddy leaves. James probingly watches. Waits. Then gets up and follows her out. Norma
FADE OUT: and Hank exit from the kitchen, Norm carrying a plate of food. She points out Tojamura to
FADE OUT: Hank.
FADE OUT: Louise said he checked into the Great Northern under
FADE OUT: the name of Tojamura. This must be the food critic.
FADE OUT: Does he have ponytail?
FADE OUT: I think he's been here already.
FADE OUT: What? When?
FADE OUT: Let me handle this.
FADE OUT: Hank takes the plate from Norma, moves towards Tojamura carrying the sliced turkey and
FADE OUT: mashed potatoes smothered with gravy. Norma looks on anxiously from the back of the
FADE OUT: room. Hank glides up and slides the plate through the air, holding it for an instant under
FADE OUT: Tojamura's.
FADE OUT: Our specialty.
FADE OUT: He then shoves the back of the Asian's head forward, ramming his face into the gravy
FADE OUT: mountain of mashed potatoes. Hank drops the plate on the table, slaps his palms clean in self-
FADE OUT: satisfaction, and looks back at a stunned Norma.
FADE OUT: This guy's no critic, he's a ...
FADE OUT: Tojamura's mud-and-cloud face rises. Hank glances down. Realizes. Wrong Asian. He looks
FADE OUT: back at Norma's Face of Death.

FADE OUT: 26. INT. SHERIFF'S STATION RECEPTION AREA - NIGHT
FADE OUT: The last half hour before closing up. ANDY BRENNAN concludes a bravura evening
FADE OUT: manning the switchboard. His chest and surrounding area are covered with yellow post-it
FADE OUT: notes.
FADE OUT: No, sir, I'm sure not the regular girl. She's gone to
FADE OUT: Tacoma to visit her sister. There's supposed to be a
FADE OUT: number for her written down here somewhere.
FADE OUT: Andy begins to look for it, but that's not what the caller is concerned about. Andy listens to
FADE OUT: him for a moment.
FADE OUT: Well, I'm certainly not a lawyer, sir, but my
FADE OUT: interpretation of the law would be that if your
FADE OUT: neighbor's cow has each of his four hoofs completely
FADE OUT: on his property, but his head is stretched over into
FADE OUT: your property and he's chewing up your ...
FADE OUT: Well, I'm certainly no veterinarian, but I think that
FADE OUT: would kill the cow. Right. Okay. Bye.
FADE OUT: Andy disconnects. A pause in the action brings him to his moment of truth. He takes out a
FADE OUT: scribbled piece of paper. Exhales. Dials.
FADE OUT: Yeah, I'm calling for some test results. Doc
FADE OUT: Hayward said I could just call you an ... what's it
FADE OUT: for? It was for a ...
FADE OUT: Semens analysis. Brennan. Andy.
FADE OUT: Yes? Uh, could you go slow, I want to write all this
FADE OUT: down.
FADE OUT: Oligospermia. That sounds terrible. I have that?
FADE OUT: Oh, I had it. "Too few sperms." Had it? You mean
FADE OUT: I'm cured?
FADE OUT: Doc said, "They're not just three guys on a fishing
FADE OUT: trip,
FADE OUT: #2.005
FADE OUT: 26. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: they're a whole damned town." Yeah, l know what
FADE OUT: that means; they're not really real people, they're ...
FADE OUT: okay, thank you. Thanks very much.
FADE OUT: Andy hangs up. He is overjoyed. Truman peeks out of his office curious about Andy's
FADE OUT: excitement. Andy turns to him.
FADE OUT: I'm a whole damned town.
FADE OUT: 27. INT. TRUMAN'S OFFICE
FADE OUT: Cooper and Truman at Truman's desk, leaning over Cooper's floor plan of One-Eyed Jack's.
FADE OUT: This is what I saw at One-Eyed Jack's. Main bar
FADE OUT: and greeting room. Offices here. Casino and
FADE OUT: Get-acquainted Room.
FADE OUT: HAWK enters. Cooper adroitly sweeps the map to the side, a move the deputy notices.
FADE OUT: The one-armed man's been staying at a motel on
FADE OUT: Highway 9. No one's seen him for the last day, day-
FADE OUT: and-a-half. His room looks lived in. I found this.
FADE OUT: Hawk empties a paper bag of SYRINGES and several VIALS OF LIQUID.
FADE OUT: Same drug, as before.
FADE OUT: Weird, deep smell.
FADE OUT: We're still waiting for Albert's analysis. Good
FADE OUT: work, Hawk.
FADE OUT: Hawk grabs a look at the plans. Truman dismisses Hawk's concern.
FADE OUT: See you in the morning, Hawk.
FADE OUT: Hawk exits. Cooper breaks the floor plans back out.
FADE OUT: We'll approach thru the woods from the back. Scale
FADE OUT: this hill to the rear door.
FADE OUT: #2.005
FADE OUT: 27. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: Our entry point.
FADE OUT: Inside are stairs that lead down to the rooms. And
FADE OUT: Audrey.
FADE OUT: What kind of muscle do they have?
FADE OUT: Couple of floor men in the casino. May be more
FADE OUT: inside, I never went back there.
FADE OUT: Let's go get her.
FADE OUT: 28. OMITTED
FADE OUT: 29. INT. RECEPTION AREA
FADE OUT: Truman and Cooper sweep by Andy. After they go out Andy reviews his scrap of paper
FADE OUT: containing the fertility information and notices for the first time the blotter upon which it sits.
FADE OUT: Lucy's blotter, with a swarm of phone numbers, one of them distinctly circled. His eyes are
FADE OUT: drawn to this fresh-looking track. He picks up the phone and dials. Two rings.
FADE OUT: Adams Abortion Clinic ... hello?
FADE OUT: Andy's face and phone hand are frozen.

FADE OUT: 30. EXT. HAROLD SMITH'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
FADE OUT: Maddy sits behind the front bushes, coffee cup in hand, eyes fixed on Harold Smith's
FADE OUT: bedroom window.
FADE OUT: 31. INT. HAROLD SMITH'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
FADE OUT: Donna and Harold sit together as before, she on the chair, he behind the desk. Harold opens
FADE OUT: the diary with quiet ceremony. Quietly, with muted intensity, he begins:
FADE OUT: Donna Hayward. Tuesday. March the seventh.
FADE OUT: Second session.
FADE OUT: Harold looks up at Donna, waits for her to begin. Donna pauses, tongue-tied, a little
FADE OUT: embarrassed. She sips from her glass of wine, as if to seek inspiration. Harold offers a
FADE OUT: comforting smile. And some unexpected humor:
FADE OUT: "Dear Diary ...
FADE OUT: Donna smiles, shrugs.
FADE OUT: Tell me a story.
FADE OUT: What kind?
FADE OUT: Anything you like. It's a diary. Filled with loves
FADE OUT: and hates.
FADE OUT: #2.005
FADE OUT: 31. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: Loves.
FADE OUT: Good.
FADE OUT: A beat. Harold waits for her to begin. Takes a sip from his own glass of wine. Finally:
FADE OUT: Uhm ... "Dear Diary ..."
FADE OUT: This is from a long time ago. Is that okay?
FADE OUT: All right. Uhm ... I'm thirteen years old. Fourteen
FADE OUT: maybe. Me and Laura put on our tightest shortest
FADE OUT: skirts. Too tight, but Laura talks me into it. And we
FADE OUT: go to the roadhouse to meet boys.
FADE OUT: Donna pauses. Harold watches her intently, writes as he listens. The room is suddenly very
FADE OUT: quiet and still. Almost eerie. As Donna gains the confidence to remember:
FADE OUT: Their names are Josh, Rick, and Tim. About twenty
FADE OUT: years old . A nd they're nice to us, they treat us like
FADE OUT: we're older. Rick asks if we want to parry and Laura
FADE OUT: says yes.
FADE OUT: There's a stream in the woods. It seems pale and
FADE OUT: light out. The boys build a fire. I like Tim the
FADE OUT: best. He isn't so full of loud jokes like the others.
FADE OUT: Rick gets out a bottle of vodka and Laura starts
FADE OUT: drinking. I can't believe how much she drinks. She
FADE OUT: hands it to me. I take a sip. It feels good.
FADE OUT: Laura starts to dance around the boys. Moving her
FADE OUT: hips back and forth. Rick starts to clap. But Tim
FADE OUT: doesn't do anything. He just watches. Somehow that
FADE OUT: makes me mad. So I say, "Let's go skinny-dipping."
FADE OUT: #2.005
FADE OUT: 31. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: We take off our clothes. I know the boys are
FADE OUT: watching us. The water feels really warm. The boy's
FADE OUT: legs are white and I can see them under the water.
FADE OUT: When Laura starts to kiss Josh and Rick, I don't know
FADE OUT: what to do. So I swim away. I think maybe I want
FADE OUT: to run but I don't. Tim swims over to me. I let him
FADE OUT: kiss me. And I let him touch me. Once.
FADE OUT: When we leave, and this is what I remember best, the
FADE OUT: boys are really nice. They don't make fun or talk
FADE OUT: down to us. And Tim ... Tim kisses my hand when
FADE OUT: we say goodbye. Then he kisses me.
FADE OUT: I can still feel that kiss. His lips are warm and
FADE OUT: sweet. My heart sort of jumps. He's talking to me
FADE OUT: but I don't really hear him. Just the kiss.
FADE OUT: I never saw him again. It was the first time I ever
FADE OUT: fell in love. But Laura ...
FADE OUT: Donna exhales, a little overwhelmed. Tears shine in her dark eyes.
FADE OUT: That's all.
FADE OUT: Sorry.
FADE OUT: That was beautiful, Donna.
FADE OUT: Harold closes the diary.
FADE OUT: #2.005
FADE OUT: 32. INT. HAROLD SMITH'S GREENHOUSE - NIGHT
FADE OUT: START CLOSE on a cymbidium orchid. Pale yellow and red. Quite beautiful. Harold
FADE OUT: Smith's voice is HEARD.
FADE OUT: HAROLD'S VOICE
FADE OUT: Most people imagine orchids growing in exotic
FADE OUT: steamy jungles. But you can grow them anywhere
FADE OUT: with the right kind of care. I mean it's all basically
FADE OUT: water and light, isn't it? Here. Look.
FADE OUT: ANOTHER ANGLE reveals Harold and Donna in the greenhouse. Artificial light. Rows of
FADE OUT: potted orchids. Harold delicately holds an orchid in his palm.
FADE OUT: It's beautiful.
FADE OUT: Humidity is paramount. The control of it, I mean.
FADE OUT: Too much moisture is an invitation to disease.
FADE OUT: Three sepals, three petals bottom petal shaped
FADE OUT: like a lip is called the labellum.
FADE OUT: The colors ...
FADE OUT: It's a landing platform, really. For pollinating
FADE OUT: insects.
FADE OUT: Donna's fingers touch the petal. Then brush against Harold's hand.
FADE OUT: It's sort of romantic.
FADE OUT: Harold now takes Donna's hand into his own. She turns toward him. And they kiss with
FADE OUT: greater intensity than before. Something akin to passion. A beat. Harold steps back from her.
FADE OUT: Will you excuse me for a minute?
FADE OUT: #2.005
FADE OUT: 32. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: Sure.
FADE OUT: Harold steps away into his bedroom. The SOUND of running water is HEARD. Donna
FADE OUT: reaches into her purse, grabs the flashlight. And races toward the front window.
FADE OUT: 33. EXT. HAROLD SMITH'S HOUSE - NIGHT

FADE OUT: eggshell walk toward the bungalow door.
FADE OUT: 34. EXT. ONE-EYED JACK'S - NIGHT
FADE OUT: Re-establish. Hank stands in the shadows, watches something in the near distance. He speaks

FADE OUT: Jack's. And he's not alone.
FADE OUT: 35. EXT. AROUND BACK - NIGHT
FADE OUT: Up over a hillside ridge, a walkway runs just the back French doors. ANGLE ON a GUARD
FADE OUT: on patrol. He hears a NOISE behind him and starts to reach for his gun, but there's suddenly
FADE OUT: a strong yank on his arm. Truman stuffs a rubber ball into his mouth and almost
FADE OUT: simultaneously slaps into handcuffs behind his back. Then from another pocket in his jacket,
FADE OUT: he seals the ball in place with tape. Cooper inspects Truman's JACKET. A modified fishing
FADE OUT: vest loaded with burglary tools. Cooper nods appreciatively. Gestures forward.
FADE OUT: They approach the back door. Locked. Truman plants in odd piece of iron between the
FADE OUT: French doors. Props it between the French doors, pushes the doors in and as they bounce
FADE OUT: back out and OPEN.
FADE OUT: 36. INT. ONE-EYED JACK'S - NIGHT
FADE OUT: Cooper and Truman enter atop a long, ill-lit stairway. They look about, alert, ready for
FADE OUT: anything, then start down the stairs. Party sounds abound from the adjoining main rooms.
FADE OUT: Cooper and Truman walk past the first hallway of noise, the casino, gliding by, trying to
FADE OUT: make themselves invisible. As they approach the next level, a GIRL leads a CUSTOMER out
FADE OUT: into the hall.
FADE OUT: #2.005
FADE OUT: 36. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: They, freeze against the wall: She looks up the stairs and happily prances right past them, a
FADE OUT: little drunk, not seeing. Cooper and Truman exhale. They descend past this level toward the
FADE OUT: darkness of the bottom floor.
FADE OUT: 37. INT. ONE-EYED JACK'S HALLWAY - NIGHT
FADE OUT: Cooper and Truman move stealthily down the hallway. They near Blackie's office, a window,
FADE OUT: their view limited by drooping red curtains. Truman peers inside. Signals "two" occupants to
FADE OUT: Cooper. Cooper gestures a reply. Stay put. I'll circle in the other direction. HOLD ON
FADE OUT: Truman for a beat, as he scoots closer, tries to get a better look inside.
FADE OUT: 38. INT. ONE-EYED JACK'S HALLWAY - NIGHT
FADE OUT: Cooper moves quietly down the hall, looking left and right. Suddenly a woman appears. It's
FADE OUT: Nancy, Blackie's sister. Cooper doesn't hesitate.
FADE OUT: Please take me to Audrey Horne. Now.
FADE OUT: I don't think she's available.
FADE OUT: Cooper takes out his pistol.

FADE OUT: Cooper takes Nancy by the arm. Allows her to lead him forward.
FADE OUT: 39. INT. BLACKIE'S OFFICE - NIGHT

FADE OUT: Not such a bad way to go. All things considered.
FADE OUT: #2.005
FADE OUT: 39. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: Is she alone?
FADE OUT: Nancy's with her.
FADE OUT: What does she do for you that I can't?
FADE OUT: You do all right.
FADE OUT: Renault loads the syringe with a practiced hand. Everything proceeds in business-like fashion.
FADE OUT: Blackie steps a little closer, eyes on the drugs that remain.
FADE OUT: 40. INT. ONE-EYED JACK'S HALLWAY - NIGHT
FADE OUT: Truman leans against the wall, having witnessed much of the latter. He looks down the
FADE OUT: hallway for Cooper, some sign. But sees and hear nothing. Truman scoots a little closer to the
FADE OUT: office door. Considers his next move.
FADE OUT: 41. INT. ONE-EYED JACK'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
FADE OUT: Cooper and Nancy enter the bedroom. Cooper sees Audrey, dazed, bound up on the bed.
FADE OUT: He gives Nancy a quick stare: of controlled rage. She equivocates:
FADE OUT: It's not my idea, okay? We're nothin' but meat on a
FADE OUT: hook to these people.
FADE OUT: I'll do whatever I can to help. Serious.
FADE OUT: Cooper's not listening. He kneels at Audrey's side.
FADE OUT: Audrey. Can you hear me?
FADE OUT: Mmmmm ... Who ... ? ... My ... my prayers ...
FADE OUT: #2.005
FADE OUT: 41. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: Audrey, I'm going to take you out of here now.
FADE OUT: Cooper hears the sound of brushing silk. He reacts, turns in time to SEE Nancy take a stiletto
FADE OUT: out of her boot. Her hand sweeps forward, blade flashing. Cooper shifts to avoid. But the
FADE OUT: steel catches his arm, rips and tears. Cooper grabs Nancy's wrist with his free hand, wrenches
FADE OUT: the knife from her grasp, sends her sprawling with a punch to the jaw. She's out cold.
FADE OUT: Cooper retrieves the knife, cuts Audrey's ropes. He bundles her in the top blanket, takes
FADE OUT: Audrey into his arms. Cooper moves as quickly as is possible. He knows he is running out of
FADE OUT: time.
FADE OUT: 42. INT./EXT. BLACKIE'S OFFICE - NIGHT
FADE OUT: Truman watches as Renault places the loaded syringe in his pocket Steps toward the door.
FADE OUT: Blackie follows, now steps in his path. She smirks, sidles into Renault's arms. A deep kiss.
FADE OUT: Truman crouches by the doorway, reaches for his pistol. Ready for action. Just then: the
FADE OUT: unmistakable WHISTLE of Renault's spring-loaded KNIFE.
FADE OUT: Blackie gasps, sags. Feels the blade enter her torso. Renault removes the knife, releases her.
FADE OUT: Blackie falls dead from his embrace to the floor.
FADE OUT: Truman reacts with shock. pistol in hand, he stands, turns toward the office.
FADE OUT: Inside the office, Renault spots Truman. He reaches for a pistol, FIRES. Truman ducks for
FADE OUT: cover. Renault's bullet strikes a window, glass shatters, flies. Truman marine crawls to a

FADE OUT: gun in his hands. Means to use it.
FADE OUT: Drop the gun.
FADE OUT: Truman deliberately places his gun on the floor. Cooper holds Audrey tightly in his arms,
FADE OUT: says nothing. The bodyguard's gun cocks. Then a hollow drum-like SOUND. Truman turns
FADE OUT: to see the guard fall forward, a bowie knife lodged deep between his scapulas. Halfway up
FADE OUT: the stairs is Hawk.
