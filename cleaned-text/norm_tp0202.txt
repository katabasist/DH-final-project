REVISIONS: 1. INT. GREAT NORTHERN DINING ROOM - DAY
REVISIONS: Morning. CAMERA MOVES slowly through the dining room, a walking POV. AGENT
REVISIONS: COOPER and ALBERT ROSENFIELD sit at a table up ahead.
REVISIONS: ANOTHER ANGLE reveals this to be the POV of the ASIAN MAN. He continues,
REVISIONS: allows a waitress to seat him.
REVISIONS: 2. INT. GREAT NORTHERN CORRIDOR - NIGHT
REVISIONS: Cooper and Albert sit at the table arrayed with breakfast foods. Griddlecakes, orange
REVISIONS: juice, coffee. Cooper eats, expounds. Albert listens.
REVISIONS: Buddhist tradition reached the Land of Snow in the fifth
REVISIONS: century A.D. The first Tibetan king to be touched by the
REVISIONS: Dharma was Ha-tho-tho-ri gnyan-btsan. He, and all
REVISIONS: succeeding kings were known collectively as the Happy
REVISIONS: Generations. Some histories place the King in the water
REVISIONS: snake year of 213 A.D. Others in 173 A.D. A water-ox
REVISIONS: year. Amazing, isn't it? The Happy Generations.
REVISIONS: Cooper takes a sip of hot coffee, beams. Albert, deadpan, just stares for a very long beat.
REVISIONS: Then, finally:
REVISIONS: Agent Cooper. I'm thrilled to pieces that the Dharma
REVISIONS: came to King Ho-Ho and the Land of Schmoes. I really
REVISIONS: am. But right now I'm trying hard to focus on the more
REVISIONS: immediate problems of our own century. Right here in
REVISIONS: Twin Peaks.
REVISIONS: You'd be surprised by the connections between the two.
REVISIONS: Color me amazed.
REVISIONS: Ronette Pulaski has come out of her coma.
REVISIONS: And?
REVISIONS: #2.002
REVISIONS: 2. CONTINUED:
REVISIONS: I'm thinking Ronette has quite a story to tell, once she
REVISIONS: regains her ability to speak.
REVISIONS: She's not talking.
REVISIONS: Wakened, but silent. Probably shock.
REVISIONS: Cooper pulls two police sketches out of his briefcase. Leo Johnson. And Bob, the long-
REVISIONS: haired man.
REVISIONS: I intend to show her these.
REVISIONS: Leo Johnson. And Bob - the man Sarah Palmer saw in her
REVISIONS: vision. The man who came to me in my dream.
REVISIONS: Has anyone seen 'Bob' on Earth in the last few weeks?
REVISIONS: Not yet.
REVISIONS: Cooper takes a big bite of griddlecake. Albert produces a report, speaks while referring to
REVISIONS: it:
REVISIONS: Fine. I performed the autopsy on Jacques Renault.
REVISIONS: Contents of the deceased's stomach revealed beer cans, a
REVISIONS: Maryland license plate, half a bicycle tire, a goat, and a
REVISIONS: small wooden puppet. Goes by the name of Pinocchio.
REVISIONS: You're making a joke.
REVISIONS: I like to think of myself as one of the Happy Generations.
REVISIONS: The killer snuffed the fat with a pillow. He was
REVISIONS: Wearing gloves. Tape used to bind his wrists was stolen
REVISIONS: from hospital supply closet. That's all. If Jacques has any
REVISIONS: secrets he'll be taking them underground.
REVISIONS: #2.002
REVISIONS: The mill?
REVISIONS: Preliminaries suggest arson. I nominate Leo Johnson.
REVISIONS: We need a statement from Shelly Johnson.
REVISIONS: Hospital says she's well enough.
REVISIONS: How do you feel?
REVISIONS: Me?
REVISIONS: I believe it's customary to inquire after the health of one
REVISIONS: recently plugged with a thirty-eight. Three times.
REVISIONS: Thanks for asking.
REVISIONS: Don't get sentimental.
REVISIONS: Who shot me, Albert?
REVISIONS: My men are interrogating hotel guests. The usual bumper
REVISIONS: crop of rural know-nothings and drunken fly fishermen.
REVISIONS: No leads so far. The world's most decrepit room service
REVISIONS: waiter remembers nothing out-of-the-ordinary about the
REVISIONS: night in question. No surprise there. Senor Drool Cup
REVISIONS: has, shall we say, a mind that wanders. He -
REVISIONS: The waitress interrupts, delivers a check. Cooper holds out a hand, signals he'll pay for it.
REVISIONS: As Cooper signs his name and room:
REVISIONS: #2.002
REVISIONS: 2. CONTINUED:
REVISIONS: I appreciate your coming, Albert. We need the very best.
REVISIONS: Dedication to duty isn't exactly what brought me here,
REVISIONS: Cooper.
REVISIONS: What is?
REVISIONS: Windom Earle.
REVISIONS: Cooper reacts with surprise. Muted trepidation.
REVISIONS: Agent Earle. He retired.
REVISIONS: To a comfortable chair complete with wrist restraints at
REVISIONS: the local laughing academy.
REVISIONS: What happened?
REVISIONS: Nobody knows. Your former partner flew the coop,
REVISIONS: Coop. Into thin air.
REVISIONS: That's not good ...
REVISIONS: HOLD ON Cooper for a beat.
REVISIONS: 3. INT. GREAT NORTHERN DINING ROOM - DAY
REVISIONS: Across the room, someone is watching. It is the Asian Man. He looks long at Agent
REVISIONS: Cooper.
REVISIONS: 4. EXT. HOSPITAL - DAY
REVISIONS: #2.002
REVISIONS: 4. INT. RONETTE PULASKI'S HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
REVISIONS: RONETTE PULASKI gazes at the ceiling with blank expression. ANOTHER ANGLE
REVISIONS: reveals Cooper and Truman at her bedside. A NURSE in the background. Cooper peers at
REVISIONS: the girl, then:
REVISIONS: Ronette?
REVISIONS: The eyes move, nothing else, to acknowledge them.
REVISIONS: Cooper produces the two police sketches, prepatory to showing them to her.
REVISIONS: Ronette, I'm going to show you some pictures. I want
REVISIONS: you to tell me if you have seen these men before. I want
REVISIONS: to know if they are the men that hurt you.
REVISIONS: His words spark a memory, the memory brings pain. All in her dark eyes. Cooper holds
REVISIONS: the sketch of Leo Johnson toward her.
REVISIONS: Do you recognize this man?
REVISIONS: A long beat. Then a surprise. Ronette's arm lifts into the air, as if separate from the rest of
REVISIONS: her body. Cooper and Truman react. Ronette gingerly takes the sketch from Cooper, brings
REVISIONS: it closer to her eyes. As if to better view it. Cooper wonders:
REVISIONS: Can you see, Ronette?
REVISIONS: Ronnette nods, almost imperceptibly. She stares at the sketch for a long, long beat.
REVISIONS: Do you know him?
REVISIONS: A long beat. Ronette proceeds slowly, as though underwater. Finally she nods. Yes.
REVISIONS: Is this the man that hurt you?
REVISIONS: Another beat. Then, finally ... she shakes her head. No.
REVISIONS: #2.002
REVISIONS: No.
REVISIONS: Cooper takes the sketch from Ronette, holds out the second picture. The long-haired man
REVISIONS: named Bob. Again, Ronette reaches for it, brings the sketch toward her face. Near-sighted,
REVISIONS: this is the only way she can clearly see it.
REVISIONS: SUDDENLY Ronette's entire body seems to seize, her eyes dart about wildly.
REVISIONS: Ronette.
REVISIONS: Ronette drops the sketch, her hand now knifes through the air, jagged motions, up and
REVISIONS: down, to the side, and up and down. The nurse hurries forward to aid or restrain. But
REVISIONS: Cooper intervenes.
REVISIONS: Wait.
REVISIONS: She's trying to spell something. Paper.
REVISIONS: Truman produces paper and pen, hands them to the girl. Ronette clutches the pen, begins to
REVISIONS: scrawl.
REVISIONS: Ronette. Is this the man that hurt you?
REVISIONS: Ronette nods furiously as she writes, tears stream down her checks. She finishes, holds the
REVISIONS: paper toward them. Cooper takes it. They read.
REVISIONS: Ronette's fearful scrawl. TRAIN. LAURA. TRAIN.
REVISIONS: The train car.
REVISIONS: But Cooper's not listening. He's staring at the sketch of Bob. The hard features. The long
REVISIONS: flowing hair. Meanwhile, Ronnette begins to moan. Softly at first. Then building to a
REVISIONS: terrified scream.
REVISIONS: HOLD ON this tableau. Ronette upon the hospital bed. Cooper, Truman, and the nurse
REVISIONS: hovering about her.
REVISIONS: #2.002
REVISIONS: 6: EXT. ONE-EYED JACK'S - DAY
REVISIONS: 7: INT. ONE-EYED JACK'S - DAY
REVISIONS: The Get Acquainted Room. Early morning ease pervades. Girls lounge in robes, smoke
REVISIONS: cigarettes. Two blondes play checkers in a corner. A third girl, NANCY, the Pickup seen
REVISIONS: previously in Audrey's room,
REVISIONS: AUDREY HORNE passes through the morning, looking for clues. She sits next to Nancy.
REVISIONS: Morning.
REVISIONS: You say that as if it's news.
REVISIONS: Audrey lights up, ignores the rebuff, gestures toward the newspaper.
REVISIONS: Well, what is news?
REVISIONS: Cookout at the Packard Mill.
REVISIONS: Audrey peers at the banner headline: MILL BURNS. She reacts with unbridled delight.
REVISIONS: Wow.
REVISIONS: Arson maybe.
REVISIONS: I'll bet. Nancy, do me a favor?
REVISIONS: I'm lookin' for somebody.
REVISIONS: Audrey produces a photograph torn from a high school yearbook. Ronette Pulaski.
REVISIONS: We worked Spokane together. Shriners and stuff.
REVISIONS: Ronette.
REVISIONS: #2.002
REVISIONS: 7. CONTINUED:
REVISIONS: You know her?
REVISIONS: Sorta. Just a summer girl. She didn't stay long.
REVISIONS: Ronette had a friend. Laura. Ever see them together?
REVISIONS: Suddenly: a male voice. It's EMORY BATTIS. Battis enters the Get-Acquainted Room,
REVISIONS: pauses to greet familiar faces.
REVISIONS: Audrey tamps out her cigarette, looks for exit.
REVISIONS: Got to go. Maybe we can talk sometime.
REVISIONS: With that, Audrey, rises, steps away. Nancy looks up from her paper, watches her leave.
REVISIONS: There's a cold look in her eyes.
REVISIONS: Anything you say, 'Miss Horne.'
REVISIONS: Busted. Nancy turns her gaze toward Battis by the door.
REVISIONS: 8. EXT. APARTMENT HOUSE - DAY
REVISIONS: DONNA HAYWARD stands at the door, carrying a covered meal tray. She checks a piece
REVISIONS: of paper, doublechecks the address. And knocks.
REVISIONS: Hello? Mrs. Tremond? Meals On Wheels.
REVISIONS: A long beat. Donna's about to step away. Then a voice from within:
REVISIONS: Enter.
REVISIONS: Donna hesitates, tries the door. It's open. She hefts the tray, steps inside.
REVISIONS: 9. INT. TREMOND APARTMENT - DAY
REVISIONS: A shadowy interior. Pill bottles of every size and description on litter the room. An old
REVISIONS: woman, MRS. TREMOND, reclines in bed. A SMALL BOY stands before her. He wears
REVISIONS: a dark suit. The boy's hands move gracefully through the air, perform a magic card trick.
REVISIONS: #2.002
REVISIONS: 9. CONTINUED:
REVISIONS: The old woman expectorates quietly into a handkerchief. She mutters.
REVISIONS: Again.
REVISIONS: The little boy repeats the magic trick. The old woman spits into the handkerchief, mutters.
REVISIONS: It's as if Donna was invisible.
REVISIONS: Mrs. Tremond?
REVISIONS: The old woman gestures toward a coffee table, more pill bottles, nearby.
REVISIONS: Please.
REVISIONS: Donna sets the tray upon the table, removes its cover. Reveals the meal beneath. The old
REVISIONS: woman shifts, peers down at the hot food.
REVISIONS: Cream corn. "I requested no cream corn.
REVISIONS: Sorry.
REVISIONS: We detest yellow food.
REVISIONS: Next time, I'll...
REVISIONS: As they speak, the little boy carries the tray to the old woman, arranges silverware. A
REVISIONS: playing card slips into view, settles amidst warm chicken and rice.
REVISIONS: My niece is a nurse. Sent me hospital food. Can you
REVISIONS: imagine?
REVISIONS: Uhm, no.
REVISIONS: Tastes like paste. I ordered Meals On Wheels myself.
REVISIONS: Laura Palmer brought them to me. She's dead.
REVISIONS: I'm taking over Laura's route.
REVISIONS: The little boy cuts a piece of chicken, holds it toward the old woman. She takes the food in
REVISIONS: #2.002
REVISIONS: 9. CONTINUED:
REVISIONS: her mouth, chews slowly. Donna stands mute, ignored for the moment.
REVISIONS: Did you know her well?
REVISIONS: No.
REVISIONS: The old woman's reply is abrupt, final. She does not desire further conversation. Donna
REVISIONS: sighs. She will learn nothing here.
REVISIONS: Enjoy your meal. I'll remember the corn.
REVISIONS: Donna steps toward the door. Suddenly:
REVISIONS: Young lady.
REVISIONS: You might ask Mr. Smith next door. He was Laura's
REVISIONS: friend. Mr. Smith does not leave his room.
REVISIONS: Thank you.
REVISIONS: The little boy steps to Donna's side. He produces a red rose, sleight of hand, and offers it to
REVISIONS: her. Donna smiles.
REVISIONS: 10. EXT. APARTMENT HOUSE - DAY
REVISIONS: Donna stands before apartment number 3, knocks. But no one answers. She scribbles a note,
REVISIONS: slides it under the door.
REVISIONS: Donna steps back to her car. Behind her, hands gently part pale curtains. Someone watches
REVISIONS: her leaving.
REVISIONS: 11. INT. BEN HORNE'S OFFICE - DAY
REVISIONS: BEN HORNE sits at his desk, a mill ledger spread out before him. JERRY HORNE
REVISIONS: bounds about, nibbling on a block of cheese. Flames leap in the office fireplace.
REVISIONS: Ben barks an order into the phone.
REVISIONS: Tell Mrs. Horne I'm in a meeting.
REVISIONS: #2.002
REVISIONS: Jerry pauses in front of Ben's desk. Gestures. As if to make a formal presentation.
REVISIONS: Ben, I'm struggling for understanding. Evidence to be
REVISIONS: examined. Two mill ledgers.
REVISIONS: One fake, one real.
REVISIONS: The real?
REVISIONS: Josie was running a loser.
REVISIONS: The fake?
REVISIONS: Catherine was covering it up.
REVISIONS: Criminally.
REVISIONS: To our advantage. With our consent.
REVISIONS: Which brings us to Andrew Packard's will.
REVISIONS: The ledger gambit guarantees the mill goes bankrupt, the
REVISIONS: will gives Catherine the mill. Catherine sells to us and
REVISIONS: pockets the cash.
REVISIONS: The intercom buzzes, intrudes. Ben sighs, picks up the phone.
REVISIONS: Now whit?! Tell her I'm still in a meeting.
REVISIONS: Ben slams down the phone.
REVISIONS: So you promised Catherine the moon. Catherine eats
REVISIONS: cheese instead.
REVISIONS: Jerry offers Ben a bite from the block he's holding. Ben shakes it off, replies:
REVISIONS: #2.002
REVISIONS: Josie is a more than pliable business partner.
REVISIONS: Query: How pliable?
REVISIONS: She gets the cash. We get the mill. And the land for
REVISIONS: Ghostwood.
REVISIONS: I wonder ... what does Josie really want?
REVISIONS: I don't know. You?
REVISIONS: Stumped.
REVISIONS: Eternal Query: What do women want?
REVISIONS: Doublestumped.
REVISIONS: Jerry's pacing brings him back to the desk, the ledger spread out before him.
REVISIONS: So ... which ledger is this?
REVISIONS: The fake.
REVISIONS: Bad news for Catherine.
REVISIONS: May flights of angels guide her to her rest.
REVISIONS: Bad news for us then.
REVISIONS: If it went public.
REVISIONS: #2.002
REVISIONS: Let's keep it private.
REVISIONS: How private?
REVISIONS: Dust to dust...
REVISIONS: Ashes to ashes.
REVISIONS: Ben tosses the ledger to Jerry. Jerry tosses the ledger into the roaring fire. Both pause to
REVISIONS: watch it burn.
REVISIONS: Just then: a harried SECRETARY marches into the office.
REVISIONS: I told you I'm in a meeting!
REVISIONS: The secretary interrupts, holds out a note for his perusal.
REVISIONS: 11. CONTINUED:
REVISIONS: Mrs. Horne?
REVISIONS: The secretary nods, exits. Ben opens the folded paper, reads. A beat.
REVISIONS: Good news?
REVISIONS: No. Audrey appears to be missing.
REVISIONS: #2.002
REVISIONS: 12. EXT. BLUE PINE LODGE - DAY
REVISIONS: 13. INT. BLUE PINE LODGE - DAY
REVISIONS: Cooper, Truman, and Albert gather about PETE MARTELL at the dining room table.
REVISIONS: Pete's dazed, a little singed around the edges.
REVISIONS: She was afraid. I've never seen Catherine afraid before.
REVISIONS: Well. When we went camping she killed a snake. And a
REVISIONS: tree hit me one time. She had a reaction.
REVISIONS: Albert rolls his eyes. But Cooper preempts him with a stern glance. Pete produces an
REVISIONS: account ledger, places it on the table.
REVISIONS: Catherine asked me to help her find the account ledger.
REVISIONS: She asked me to help her.
REVISIONS: This was in her safe. Catherine said it was the wrong one.
REVISIONS: Josie showed me a second ledger.
REVISIONS: Sounds like your wife was cookin' the books.
REVISIONS: We couldn't find it anywhere. But I found my high school
REVISIONS: yearbook. Midge Jones.
REVISIONS: Midge had blue eyes like a robin's egg. And a funny way
REVISIONS: of walking. One foot here, one foot there, one foot here,
REVISIONS: one foot there.
REVISIONS: Feets don't fail me now.
REVISIONS: Pete? Let's make a heroic attempt to keep our minds, and
REVISIONS: what's left of yours, trained on the night in question. The
REVISIONS: night the mill burned down.
REVISIONS: #2.002
REVISIONS: 13. CONTINUED:
REVISIONS: Pete looks up, seems to see Albert for the first time.
REVISIONS: I don't like you.
REVISIONS: No one does, Pete.
REVISIONS: Amen to that.
REVISIONS: Well bounce my butt out of the Glee Club. Gentlemen,
REVISIONS: I've got a job to do.
REVISIONS: Did Catherine tell you what was in the ledger?
REVISIONS: Heavens no. But she was desperate to find it. Until the
REVISIONS: phone rang and she was gone. I saw her car out front. The
REVISIONS: mill was burning. So I went inside ...
REVISIONS: Pete can't continue.
REVISIONS: I'm sorry, Pete. We all are.
REVISIONS: Have you found ... her body?
REVISIONS: Cooper shakes his head. No.
REVISIONS: A mill fire burns somewhere close to two thousand
REVISIONS: degrees, Mr. Martell. That's hot enough to incinerate
REVISIONS: bone.
REVISIONS: Cooper places a reproving hand on Albert's, stops him from continuing. Pete fixes Albert
REVISIONS: with a baleful stare. A beat. Then, in a whisper:
REVISIONS: Catherine's dead.
REVISIONS: Pete sighs. Then stands, offers.
REVISIONS: #2.002
REVISIONS: 13. CONTINUED:
REVISIONS: Let me get you boys some coffee.
REVISIONS: Pete shuffles off toward the kitchen. Cooper and Albert trade conclusions. Truman watches
REVISIONS: quietly, as a spectator at a tennis match.
REVISIONS: Leo's clothing reeked of gasoline.
REVISIONS: Gas cans found at the hot spot matched those in the back
REVISIONS: of his truck.
REVISIONS: Catherine hired Leo to burn down the mill.
REVISIONS: She gets a phone call. From Leo?
REVISIONS: Maybe something went wrong.
REVISIONS: Wrong enough. Mill burns. Catherine with it.
REVISIONS: I want Shelly Johnson. She can put Leo at the scene.
REVISIONS: Catherine too.
INTERCUT WITH: 
INTERCUT WITH: 14. INT. BLUE PINE LODGE KITCHEN - DAY
INTERCUT WITH: Pete prepares coffee. Wipes a fugitive tear from his eye. The phone rings. He answers it.
INTERCUT WITH: Hello?
INTERCUT WITH: Josie! Where are you?
INTERCUT WITH: Pete writes down her reply.
INTERCUT WITH: Harry and Agent Cooper arc in the living room with a
INTERCUT WITH: man I don't like. I can -
INTERCUT WITH: All right, Josie. I won't tell a soul.
INTERCUT WITH: #2.002
INTERCUT WITH: 15. INT. BLUE PINE LODGE - DAY
INTERCUT WITH: Meanwhile, Cooper and Albert continue. Truman spectates as before.
INTERCUT WITH: We need a look at Catherine Martell's will.
INTERCUT WITH: Who stood to benefit from her death?
INTERCUT WITH: Who gets the mill? Or what's left of it.
INTERCUT WITH: Life insurance.
INTERCUT WITH: I'll run the policy for beneficiaries.
INTERCUT WITH: Albert turns to Truman, sneers at his silence.
INTERCUT WITH: Don't be shy, Prince of Yokels. You too can participate in
INTERCUT WITH: the investigatory process.
INTERCUT WITH: Truman rises. Cooper grabs him by the arm. Just then: Pete interrupts.
INTERCUT WITH: Excuse me, boys. Coffee. Piping hot.
INTERCUT WITH: Morons and mooncalves, everywhere I go.
INTERCUT WITH: Pete carries a wooden tray into view. He speaks as he sets and pours coffee for four.
INTERCUT WITH: When I met Catherine, she was dating a fellow named
INTERCUT WITH: Rodney Pocquet. French-Canadian millionare's son.
INTERCUT WITH: Rich as Croesus. Rodney never said it, but he looked
INTERCUT WITH: down on me. I know he did. And why not? Rodney in
INTERCUT WITH: his fine summer suits. Me in my overalls and boots. I
INTERCUT WITH: never minded all that much.
INTERCUT WITH: Until he started talking rude to me. Like I wasn't even
INTERCUT WITH: there. Rodney Pocquet hurt my feelings. He embarrassed
INTERCUT WITH: me in front of my friends. That made me mad.
INTERCUT WITH: Pete pauses, sets down the coffee pot. Albert wonders.
INTERCUT WITH: #2.002
INTERCUT WITH: 18A.
INTERCUT WITH: Is there a point to this insensate ramble?
INTERCUT WITH: Well, yes. There is. I hiked up to Rodney's big house.
INTERCUT WITH: And I socked him on the jaw. Rodney never talked that
INTERCUT WITH: way to me again.
INTERCUT WITH: Albert looks to Cooper and Truman. He knows what's coming.
INTERCUT WITH: Not again.
INTERCUT WITH: They nod. And Pete floors Albert with a slow right cross to the jaw.
INTERCUT WITH: 16. INT. THE DOUBLE R DINER - DAY
INTERCUT WITH: OPEN ON a police flyer. The official sketch of the long-haired man named Bob. And a
INTERCUT WITH: headline. HAVE YOU SEEN THIS MAN?
INTERCUT WITH: ANOTHER ANGLE reveals DEPUTY ANDY BRENNAN as he carefully attaches the
INTERCUT WITH: flyer to the inside of the Double R Diner doors. Andy's using scotch tape to affix the paper
INTERCUT WITH: flyer. He's managed to get a piece caught in his tufted hair. LELAND PALMER and
INTERCUT WITH: MADDY FERGUSON enter past Andy and move to a booth. Leland is resplendent in
INTERCUT WITH: sharp suit, bright white hair, and a whole new attitude. He nearly beams.
INTERCUT WITH: #2.002
INTERCUT WITH: 16. CONTINUED:
INTERCUT WITH: Best chocolate malteds this side of the Mississippi.
INTERCUT WITH: I haven't tried a malt here yet.
INTERCUT WITH: Then I insist, dear. Simple pleasures. Life is too short.
INTERCUT WITH: NORMA JENNINGS approaches.
INTERCUT WITH: Norma, two chocolate malteds, with a dollop of
INTERCUT WITH: whipped cream on the top.
INTERCUT WITH: You're looking well, Mr. Palmer.
INTERCUT WITH: I'm feeling well, thank you.
INTERCUT WITH: Norma moves back to the counter. Leland recounts a happy memory.
INTERCUT WITH: Laura's favorite was a drink we used to call a Brown Cow.
INTERCUT WITH: It's like a root beer float only made with a cola drink
INTERCUT WITH: and vanilla ice cream. She had her first, with me, in that
INTERCUT WITH: booth right there.
INTERCUT WITH: I'm glad you're feeling better, Uncle Leland.
INTERCUT WITH: A man must take care of his family. And I still have a
INTERCUT WITH: family to take care of.
INTERCUT WITH: He reaches over, takes her hands. With pride.
INTERCUT WITH: I'm coming through the pain, Maddy. I'm coming
INTERCUT WITH: through alive.
INTERCUT WITH: 17. INT. DINER - DAY
INTERCUT WITH: Behind the counter, Norma makes chocolate shakes. HANK JENNINGS enters the diner,
INTERCUT WITH: moves behind the counter with a winning smile. Norma can't help but return it.
INTERCUT WITH: What are you grinning about?
INTERCUT WITH: #2.002
INTERCUT WITH: 17. CONTINUED:
INTERCUT WITH: You.
INTERCUT WITH: Hank.
INTERCUT WITH: I look at you, and I feel a little tug at the edge of my
INTERCUT WITH: lips, right next to the kissing part. And before I know it,
INTERCUT WITH: I'm grinning again.
INTERCUT WITH: No sale; you're thirty minutes late.
INTERCUT WITH: Okay, you found me out.
INTERCUT WITH: Hank produces a poloroid, holds it up for Norma to examine.
INTERCUT WITH: A 1965 GTO. Convertible. One owner. Forty thousand
INTERCUT WITH: miles. Clean and cherry.
INTERCUT WITH: For what?
INTERCUT WITH: For you. It's a surprise, honey. Well, it was.
INTERCUT WITH: Where will we get the money? The diner's barely
INTERCUT WITH: breaking even.
INTERCUT WITH: I put a little money away for something special. Trust
INTERCUT WITH: me, okay?
INTERCUT WITH: Trust you?
INTERCUT WITH: Hank pulls Norma a little closer, brings his hips as close as propriety allows. Norma
INTERCUT WITH: reacts, but she doesn't move away. Hank nearly whispers.
INTERCUT WITH: It's the car you always wanted, Norma. The car I said
INTERCUT WITH: I'd get you one day. Remember?
INTERCUT WITH: #2.002
INTERCUT WITH: Tell me you remember, Norma.
INTERCUT WITH: Norma looks him right in the eyes, gently, but determined to resist him just the same.
INTERCUT WITH: I remember.
INTERCUT WITH: With that she picks up the malteds and moves to Leland's booth.
INTERCUT WITH: 18. INT. THE DOUBLE R DINER - DAY
INTERCUT WITH: Norma sets down the malteds.
INTERCUT WITH: Thank you, Norma. Now, Maddy, a little piece of
INTERCUT WITH: heaven.
INTERCUT WITH: They try their malteds.
INTERCUT WITH: Incredible.
INTERCUT WITH: What did I tell you? Just another routine miracle of
INTERCUT WITH: everyday life here in Twin Peaks.
INTERCUT WITH: Uncle Leland, you're doing all the right things.
INTERCUT WITH: What do you mean, dear?
INTERCUT WITH: When Dad died two years ago, I thought I'd never get
INTERCUT WITH: over it. Mom never has. It was focusing on the little
INTERCUT WITH: things that got me through it. The "everyday miracles."
INTERCUT WITH: Life is a miracle. Maddy, I want to say something to
INTERCUT WITH: you, you don't have to answer, in fact you shouldn't. You
INTERCUT WITH: should think about it first. Promise first.
INTERCUT WITH: Okay.
INTERCUT WITH: You've said you don't really have that much to go back to
INTERCUT WITH: in Missoula. You've also said how much you like it here.
INTERCUT WITH: #2.002
INTERCUT WITH: 18. CONTINUED:
INTERCUT WITH: It's true.
INTERCUT WITH: What I want to say is: you don't have to go back. You can
INTERCUT WITH: stay with Sarah and me if you like, get your own place, of
INTERCUT WITH: course, but stay in town. We're family, too. We can
INTERCUT WITH: make a family here.
INTERCUT WITH: I don't know what to say.
INTERCUT WITH: You shouldn't say anything until you eat that malted.
INTERCUT WITH: She smiles. They dig in.
INTERCUT WITH: 21. INT. THE DOUBLE R DINER - DAY
INTERCUT WITH: MAJOR BRIGGS enters and sits at the counter, enjoys a cup of coffee, a little
INTERCUT WITH: contemplation. The LOG LADY appears, sits beside him. Holding, patting her log. She
INTERCUT WITH: eyes the medals arrayed on the Major's uniform.
INTERCUT WITH: You wear bright objects on your chest.
INTERCUT WITH: Yes. I do.
INTERCUT WITH: Are you proud?
INTERCUT WITH: Achievement is its own reward. Pride obscures it.
INTERCUT WITH: Cream?
INTERCUT WITH: The Log Lady nods. Major Briggs adds cream to her coffee. She sips.
INTERCUT WITH: My log has something to tell you. Do you know him?
INTERCUT WITH: I don't believe we've been introduced.
INTERCUT WITH: My log requires no introduction. Can you hear it?
INTERCUT WITH: #2.002
INTERCUT WITH: 21. CONTINUED-
INTERCUT WITH: No, ma'am. I cannot.
INTERCUT WITH: I will translate.
INTERCUT WITH: 'Deliver the message.' Do you understand?
INTERCUT WITH: Major Briggs peers at the Log Lady with the usual impenetrable resolve. Then, a surprise:
INTERCUT WITH: Yes. As a matter of fact, I do.
INTERCUT WITH: 22. EXT. SHERIFF'S STATION - DAY
INTERCUT WITH: 23. INT. SHERIFF'S STATION - DAY
INTERCUT WITH: Deputy Andy marches up to reception, LUCY MORAN behind the sliding glass. He pulls
INTERCUT WITH: it open with a forceful tug. But Lucy glares ...
INTERCUT WITH: No messages, Deputy Brennen.
INTERCUT WITH: ... and slams it shut. Undaunted, Deputy Andy throws the glass partition open a second time,
INTERCUT WITH: even more forcefully. Lucy reacts with surprise.
INTERCUT WITH: Listen to me, Lucy Moran. You just listen.
INTERCUT WITH: When the Tacoma Sperm Bank was looking for donors,
INTERCUT WITH: naturally I applied. But a routine physical revealed that I
INTERCUT WITH: was sterile. Sure, I thought it meant I didn't have to
INTERCUT WITH: bathe, but the doctors told me the truth. They told me I
INTERCUT WITH: can't have babies. So what I want to know now is why are
INTERCUT WITH: you having one? And how?
INTERCUT WITH: Lucy looks up at Andy, her lips quivering slightly. Then she reaches forward, as if to caress
INTERCUT WITH: him. Andy reacts, leans closer ... and Lucy TEARS the scotch tape from his head, closes the
INTERCUT WITH: glass door one last time.
INTERCUT WITH: 24. INT. SHERIFF TRUMAN'S OFFICE - DAY
INTERCUT WITH: Hank Jennings stands and stares at the stag's head mounted on the wall behind Sheriff
INTERCUT WITH: Truman's desk. There's a placard beneath it that reads: THE BUCK STOPPED HERE.
INTERCUT WITH: Suddenly, a voice behind him:
INTERCUT WITH: #2.002
INTERCUT WITH: 24. CONTINUED-
INTERCUT WITH: TRUMAN'S VOICE
INTERCUT WITH: Hello, Hank.
INTERCUT WITH: Hank turns to find Sheriff Truman and Agent Cooper enter the office.
INTERCUT WITH: I'm betting Lucy asked you to wait outside.
INTERCUT WITH: Might've. You know me, Harry. I'm an impulsive guy.
INTERCUT WITH: Truman sighs, circles to his desk. Retrieves the appropriate form.
INTERCUT WITH: I know enough not to waste my time on small talk. So
INTERCUT WITH: why don't you sign in like a good boy, and keep your nose
INTERCUT WITH: clean for another week.
INTERCUT WITH: Hank stares at Harry for a long beat. There is bad blood between them. Then he signs
INTERCUT WITH: without a word, turns on his heels, and steps out the door. A beat, then:
INTERCUT WITH: How long were you and Hank friends?
INTERCUT WITH: We grew up together. Ed, Hawk, Hank, myself.
INTERCUT WITH: Bookhouse Boys. Back then Hank was the best of us.
INTERCUT WITH: But he had a way of setting his heart on something, then
INTERCUT WITH: taking it. No matter how much it cost him. One day he
INTERCUT WITH: set his heart on Norma. And he took her from Big Ed.
INTERCUT WITH: "Never cheat a pal." That was our code. Hank broke it.
INTERCUT WITH: An intercom beeper interrupts. Lucy's VOICE is heard:
INTERCUT WITH: LUCY'S VOICE
INTERCUT WITH: Sheriff Truman? I have Ben Home on the phone for you.
INTERCUT WITH: The line with the light that's blinking.
INTERCUT WITH: Thank you, Lucy ... hello? Yes, Ben ... What? ... Right away.
INTERCUT WITH: Truman returns the phone to its cradle. He looks up at Cooper, speaks with quiet urgency:
INTERCUT WITH: Audrey Horne is missing.
INTERCUT WITH: #2.002
INTERCUT WITH: 25. INT. SHERIFF'S STATION - DAY
INTERCUT WITH: Harry escorts Ben out of his office.
INTERCUT WITH: I'd appreciate it if you would keep this quiet, Harry.
INTERCUT WITH: I'll do what I can. But...
INTERCUT WITH: Audrey has a penchant for the dramatic. The unexplained
INTERCUT WITH: disappearance, is, after all, a part of her repetoire. And
INTERCUT WITH: with Laura's killer in custody, well, you understand. No
INTERCUT WITH: need to panic.
INTERCUT WITH: Harry knows different. But Ben's attitude irks him just the same.
INTERCUT WITH: I understand, Ben. We'll be in touch.
INTERCUT WITH: Ben exits. Harry turns to find Cooper in the office doorway, watching with evident concern.
INTERCUT WITH: 26. INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
INTERCUT WITH: LEO JOHNSON stares at the ceiling. At the future, at the past, at nothing at all. His eyes
INTERCUT WITH: are blank and fathomless.
INTERCUT WITH: SHELLY JOHNSON stands with DOC HAYWARD at his bedside. She is dressed in
INTERCUT WITH: hospital garb. Shelly peers at Leo with fear, muted revulsion. His death was something to
INTERCUT WITH: be wished for. But this intermediate state is beyond Shelly's ability to understand.
INTERCUT WITH: The bullet lodged in Leo's spine. We removed it
INTERCUT WITH: successfully. As for possible paralysis, it's too early to
INTERCUT WITH: tell. Leo lost so much blood, most of it before we had a
INTERCUT WITH: chance to' operate...
INTERCUT WITH: I'm afraid tile resulting oxygen deprivation starved his
INTERCUT WITH: brain, induced the coma you see here.
INTERCUT WITH: He's a vegetable?
INTERCUT WITH: #2.002
INTERCUT WITH: 26. CONTINUED:
INTERCUT WITH: He is not in pain. Beyond that, it's hard to tell.
INTERCUT WITH: Can you make him better?
INTERCUT WITH: Shelly's tone suggests she's not exactly pining for cure.
INTERCUT WITH: We can maintain his current state. Offer him
INTERCUT WITH: nourishment, life support. But beyond that, our only ally
INTERCUT WITH: is time. I'm sorry, Shelly.
INTERCUT WITH: Me too. Arc they going to put him in prison?
INTERCUT WITH: I know he's suspected of several felonies. But he can't be
INTERCUT WITH: charged with a crime until he's conscious or ruled
INTERCUT WITH: competent to stand trial.
INTERCUT WITH: I guess, at the moment, he's kind of in prison anyway.
INTERCUT WITH: Yes he is.
INTERCUT WITH: She starts to cry, softly. Doc puts a comforting arm around her.
INTERCUT WITH: #2.002
INTERCUT WITH: 27. INT. GREAT NORTHERN HOTEL LOBBY - DAY
INTERCUT WITH: Leland Palmer steps through the lobby. Full of life, new purpose, he nearly skips. A
INTERCUT WITH: receptionist sees him pass by, doubletakes.
INTERCUT WITH: 28. INT. BEN HORNE'S OFFICE - DAY
INTERCUT WITH: Ben sits behind his desk. Jerry enters, tosses a document upon it.
INTERCUT WITH: One life insurance policy. Unsigned.
INTERCUT WITH: 'Un'?!
INTERCUT WITH: The agent said Catherine was concerned about "certain
INTERCUT WITH: irregularities." Like naming Josie chief beneficiary.
INTERCUT WITH: The agent wasn't supposed to show it to her.
INTERCUT WITH: Considering Catherine's toasty fate, for our side it's just
INTERCUT WITH: as well
INTERCUT WITH: Win a few, lose a few ... let's get those pickled Icemen on
INTERCUT WITH: the blower.
INTERCUT WITH: Jerry starts to dial internationally. Ben picks up an extension. Just then: a cheery shout at the
INTERCUT WITH: door.
INTERCUT WITH: LELAND'S VOICE
INTERCUT WITH: Gentlemen!!
INTERCUT WITH: Ben looks up. Now what? Leland hops into the office, all smiles and manic energy.
INTERCUT WITH: I've been giving this a lot of thought. The mill fire will
INTERCUT WITH: no doubt put contract signing on hold for the moment, so
INTERCUT WITH: we must insure that the moment, our moment, does not
INTERCUT WITH: pass. I would recommend a quick and cordialfollow-up
INTERCUT WITH: phonecall to Iceland, a little gentle handling, just to let
INTERCUT WITH: Einer know we're on top of it.
INTERCUT WITH: #2.002
INTERCUT WITH: 28. CONTINUED:
INTERCUT WITH: We can handle that.
INTERCUT WITH: Just then: the call comes through.
INTERCUT WITH: Ben Home for Einer Thorson - Einer!
INTERCUT WITH: What's that? You heard about it how? Mr. Palmer called
INTERCUT WITH: you to tell you about the fire?
INTERCUT WITH: Leland gives a big "ok" sign to Ben. Jerry rolls his eyes.
INTERCUT WITH: No, I wouldn't call it a disaster at all. It was just one of
INTERCUT WITH: those things. An unfortunate development but I assure you
INTERCUT WITH: it in no way affects our developmcnt plans.
INTERCUT WITH: Jerry Horne here, Einer. All systems go. Full speed
INTERCUT WITH: ahead.
INTERCUT WITH: Of course, Einer. We will fax you all the pertinent
INTERCUT WITH: details. Yes, Einer, immediately. Don't you worry your
INTERCUT WITH: attractive little blond head about it, listen, in a meeting,
INTERCUT WITH: gotta run.
INTERCUT WITH: Ben puts down the receiver.
INTERCUT WITH: Leland, here's an idea, let's take you off damage control
INTERCUT WITH: and have you concentrate on something you can handle,
INTERCUT WITH: like my tax return -
INTERCUT WITH: #2.002
INTERCUT WITH: But Leland's not listening. He stares at Ben's desk, the police flyer upon it. Bob the long-
INTERCUT WITH: haired man. HAVE YOU SEEN ...?
INTERCUT WITH: I know him.
INTERCUT WITH: Excuse me?
INTERCUT WITH: Leland picks up the flyer, stares at the sketch. His mood is suddenly quiet, pensive.
INTERCUT WITH: My grandfather's summer home at Pearl Lakes. He lived
INTERCUT WITH: next door. I was only a boy. But I know him.
INTERCUT WITH: I must tell the Sheriff immedidately.
INTERCUT WITH: Leland turns on his heels and marches out the door. A beat, then:
INTERCUT WITH: I would like, I deserve, a little fun in my day. Nothing
INTERCUT WITH: complicated. No big deal. just a little fun.
INTERCUT WITH: 29. EXT. ONE-EYED JACK'S - NIGHT
INTERCUT WITH: 30. INT. ONE-EYED JACK'S CORRIDOR - NIGHT
INTERCUT WITH: An attractive Fifty-Two PICKUP carries a bucket of ice down the hall. Audrey lingers
INTERCUT WITH: outside a closed door, wonders.
INTERCUT WITH: I'll take it from here. Tag team.
INTERCUT WITH: The Pickup shrugs, offers the bucket. And her free hand to 'tag.' Audrey slaps her palm,
INTERCUT WITH: carries the ice inside.
INTERCUT WITH: #2.002
INTERCUT WITH: 31. INT. ONE-EYED JACKS ROOM - NIGHT
INTERCUT WITH: Emory Battis sits in a comfortable armchair, feet up. He wears an Oriental robe, a Santa's
INTERCUT WITH: cap, and a silk scarf tied around his eyes. His toenails have been painted bright red, cotton
INTERCUT WITH: balls between them as they dry.
INTERCUT WITH: Battis hears the door open, chirps:
INTERCUT WITH: Frosty? My little Snowman?
INTERCUT WITH: Audrey enters, sets the bucket at his feet. Battis, blindfolded, grins.
INTERCUT WITH: I feel a cold front moving in.
INTERCUT WITH: Audrey slips behind him, places her hands over the blindfold. Then slowly unties the knot
INTERCUT WITH: behind his head.
INTERCUT WITH: Mmmm. Better. Visible sin.
INTERCUT WITH: Audrey lets the loosened scarf slip down about his chin. Then, before he can react - she pulls
INTERCUT WITH: it tightly about his neck.
INTERCUT WITH: Hey!
INTERCUT WITH: Hiya, Mr. Battis. Remember me?
INTERCUT WITH: The voice, a glimpse of her face, tell Battis all he needs to know. He nods.
INTERCUT WITH: I'm gonna tell you a bedtime story. Are you listening?
INTERCUT WITH: With that she tugs the scarf a little tighter.
INTERCUT WITH: Yes. Yes.
INTERCUT WITH: Once upon a time there was this innocent little girl
INTERCUT WITH: named Red. That's me. And she met a horrible wolf.
INTERCUT WITH: That's you. And the wolf took her to a secret place and
INTERCUT WITH: did terrible things to her against her will. But the little
INTERCUT WITH: girl was tougher than she looked. She kicked the crap out
INTERCUT WITH: of the bad old wolf, and told her father all about it.
INTERCUT WITH: After that she told the police. And the bad old wolf
INTERCUT WITH: went to prison for a thousand years.
INTERCUT WITH: #2.002
INTERCUT WITH: 31. CONTINUED:
INTERCUT WITH: As she speaks, Audrey twists the scarf tighter and tighter. Now she releases it. Battis gasps
INTERCUT WITH: for breath. At last:
INTERCUT WITH: What do you want?
INTERCUT WITH: I want to know everything you know. The perfume
INTERCUT WITH: counter. Laura Palmer. Ronette Pulaski. And One-Eyed
INTERCUT WITH: Jack's.
INTERCUT WITH: You're insane.
INTERCUT WITH: I'm Audrey Horne. And I get what I want. Understand?
INTERCUT WITH: Audrey moves as if to tighten the scarf again. Battis protests.
INTERCUT WITH: Yes. All right.
INTERCUT WITH: A long beat. Battis sighs. And begins:
INTERCUT WITH: I work for the owner of One-Eyed Jack's.
INTERCUT WITH: Audrey pulls on the scarf. Whenever Battis hesitates, is tempted to lie, she reins him in.
INTERCUT WITH: Who is?
INTERCUT WITH: Your father. He owns it all. Hell, he owns everything.
INTERCUT WITH: I run girls through the perfume counter. I recruited
INTERCUT WITH: Ronnette and Laura.
INTERCUT WITH: Did Laura come here?
INTERCUT WITH: One weekend. She was using drugs, we threw her out. I
INTERCUT WITH: never saw her again. I swear.
INTERCUT WITH: Did my father know she was here?
INTERCUT WITH: #2.002
INTERCUT WITH: 31. CONTINUED:
INTERCUT WITH: Yes. Yes he did. Mr. Home makes it his business to
INTERCUT WITH: entertain all the girls.
INTERCUT WITH: Did she know Jac owned it.?
INTERCUT WITH: Owned what?
INTERCUT WITH: One-Eyed Jack's.
INTERCUT WITH: I don't know. Yes. Yes, she probably did.
INTERCUT WITH: Audrey finally drops the scarf from his neck. The information - her father, Laura - troubles
INTERCUT WITH: her deeply. Scares her too. A beat. Then, quietly:
INTERCUT WITH: Laura always got what she wanted. Just like you.
INTERCUT WITH: Understand?
INTERCUT WITH: The repetition chills her.
INTERCUT WITH: 32 EXT. HAYWARD HOUSE - NIGHT
INTERCUT WITH: JAMES HURLEY sits on a couch in the living room, holds a guitar in his hands. Donnna sits
INTERCUT WITH: in a chair nearby, watches him play.
INTERCUT WITH: It's a slow blues riff, snakes and ladders up the fret board. James concentrates with typically
INTERCUT WITH: solemn expression, lost in the music. Then he looks up, sees Maddy return to the room with
INTERCUT WITH: a soda.
INTERCUT WITH: Maddy smiles, sways to the music. Then, slowly, she begins to dance. It's a sweet sudden
INTERCUT WITH: moment. Maddy dancing across the carpet, hips rolling side to side, her body keeping
INTERCUT WITH: time. James stares at Maddy. The sexy steps. The easy smile. It could almost be Laura
INTERCUT WITH: dancing there.
INTERCUT WITH: Donna sees it too. She frowns, steps quickly from the room.
INTERCUT WITH: Excuse me.
INTERCUT WITH: James abruptly stops playing. Maddy dances a single beat after, then freezes. James follows
INTERCUT WITH: Donna toward the kitchen.
INTERCUT WITH: 33 INT. HAYWARD HOUSE CORRIDOR - NIGHT
INTERCUT WITH: James catches up to her in the hall. He takes Donna by the arm. Donna whirls violently
INTERCUT WITH: about to face him.
INTERCUT WITH: Donna, what's going on?
INTERCUT WITH: Nothing.
INTERCUT WITH: Donna -
INTERCUT WITH: Donna interrupts with a passionate embrace. James resists at first. But Donna will not be
INTERCUT WITH: dissuaded. She bites at his lips, offers soft kisses, then hard. James relents. And their
INTERCUT WITH: embrace deepens, gives rise to whispered moans. And the fevered kiss continues.
INTERCUT WITH: Finally: James pulls away, quite breathless. He looks at Donna in the shadows, as if uncertain
INTERCUT WITH: who is standing there.
INTERCUT WITH: Donna, what's going on?
INTERCUT WITH: #2.002
INTERCUT WITH: 33. CONTINUED:
INTERCUT WITH: I'm trembling, James. You made me.
INTERCUT WITH: Donna reaches for James, means to pull him back again. But a telephone rings OFF-
INTERCUT WITH: SCREEN. Doc Hayward's VOICE is heard.
INTERCUT WITH: HAYWARD'S VOICE
INTERCUT WITH: Donna. It's for you. Harold Smith?
INTERCUT WITH: Donna reacts. Steps away.
INTERCUT WITH: 34. INT. HAYWARD HOUSE - NIGHT
INTERCUT WITH: Donna moves to the phone, answers.
INTERCUT WITH: Hello? Mr. Smith?
INTERCUT WITH: SMITH'S VOICE
INTERCUT WITH: I received your note.
INTERCUT WITH: I received yours.
INTERCUT WITH: SMITH'S VOICE
INTERCUT WITH: Yes.
INTERCUT WITH: I'd like to talk to you.
INTERCUT WITH: SMITH'S VOICE
INTERCUT WITH: Tomorrow.
INTERCUT WITH: Great. We can meet ... ?
INTERCUT WITH: SMITH'S VOICE
INTERCUT WITH: Here. At noon. The time we meet is critical.
INTERCUT WITH: Oh. Okay.
INTERCUT WITH: SMITH'S VOICE
INTERCUT WITH: Tomorrow, Donna. I will show you what Laura gave me.
INTERCUT WITH: He hangs up. Donna holds the phone for a beat. Now sees James standing in a doorway,
INTERCUT WITH: wondering who she's talking to.
INTERCUT WITH: #2.002
INTERCUT WITH: 35. INT. HAYWARD LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
INTERCUT WITH: Maddy sits alone. She feels a chill, looks to her right.
INTERCUT WITH: BOB, the long-haired man, sits-quietly at the dining, room table. Now he turns to face her,
INTERCUT WITH: returns Maddy's gaze.
INTERCUT WITH: Maddy screams. Donna and James rush back into the living room.
INTERCUT WITH: Maddy!
INTERCUT WITH: James rushes to her side, takes Maddy into his arms. She's nearly in shock.
INTERCUT WITH: What happened?
INTERCUT WITH: Are you all right?
INTERCUT WITH: Maddy turns back toward the dining room, afraid of what she might see. But the long
INTERCUT WITH: haired man is gone.
INTERCUT WITH: 36. EXT. LEO JOHNSON'S HOUSE - NIGHT
INTERCUT WITH: 37. INT. LEO JOHNSON'S HOUSE - NIGHT
INTERCUT WITH: BOBBY BRIGGS and Shelly sit entwined upon a couch.
INTERCUT WITH: It's so weird. It's like his eyes are empty but he's looking
INTERCUT WITH: at something really far away. Like he's remembering.
INTERCUT WITH: Weird.
INTERCUT WITH: I don't want to be afraid of Leo anymore.
INTERCUT WITH: Bobby's here, baby. You don't have to be afraid.
INTERCUT WITH: #2.002
INTERCUT WITH: 37. CONTINUED:
INTERCUT WITH: Did you find out about the insurance?
INTERCUT WITH: I made a couple calls. Told 'em I was Leo's cousin. Leo
INTERCUT WITH: gets his disability as long as he's not in prison. It's a lot
INTERCUT WITH: of money, Shelly, over five thousand a month. But you
INTERCUT WITH: only get it if Leo stays at home.
INTERCUT WITH: I don't care about the money. I don't want Leo home.
INTERCUT WITH: Leo's in dreamland. We can stick him in a corner and
INTERCUT WITH: hang plants from his ears.
INTERCUT WITH: Sheriff Truman wants me to make a statement.
INTERCUT WITH: No way. Tell the Sheriff you got amnesia or something.
INTERCUT WITH: The fire twisted your brain.
INTERCUT WITH: I'm feeling pretty twisted right now.
INTERCUT WITH: They can't force you to testify against your husband. All
INTERCUT WITH: you got to do is get Leo home. Then sit back and collect
INTERCUT WITH: the checks.
INTERCUT WITH: Leo owes you, baby. Now we can really make him pay.
INTERCUT WITH: You want something nice? We can buy it. You wanna go
INTERCUT WITH: someplace special, sit in the sun? It's on Leo.
INTERCUT WITH: Understand?
INTERCUT WITH: It'd be nice not to worry about money. I got a shoebox
INTERCUT WITH: full of bills ...
INTERCUT WITH: Bills. Forget about bills. We're talkin' about a new life
INTERCUT WITH: here.
INTERCUT WITH: Together?
INTERCUT WITH: #2.002
INTERCUT WITH: 37-38
INTERCUT WITH: 37. CONTINUED:
INTERCUT WITH: What do you think?
INTERCUT WITH: Bobby lifts Shelly's hand to his mouth, kisses it. He gently sucks on a finger. Shelly sighs.
INTERCUT WITH: I think I want to get comfortable.
INTERCUT WITH: Shelly flows into Bobby's arms, kisses him, playfully bites at his lip. Bobby hums with
INTERCUT WITH: pleasure.
INTERCUT WITH: Bobby Briggs, I'm gonna eat you up.
INTERCUT WITH: Promise?
INTERCUT WITH: Just watch me.
INTERCUT WITH: Bobby and Shelly sink down upon the couch to make love.
INTERCUT WITH: 38. OMITTED
INTERCUT WITH: 39. INT. AGENT COOPER'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
INTERCUT WITH: START CLOSE on Audrey's note to Agent Cooper, still hidden on the floor beneath his bed.
INTERCUT WITH: A trilling musical scale is HEARD from above.
INTERCUT WITH: CAMERA REVEALS Cooper on his bed, shoes off, holding his handmade wooden flute.
INTERCUT WITH: He pauses to glance at the television glowing in a corner. Then en activates the micro-
INTERCUT WITH: recorder positioned on a bedside table.
INTERCUT WITH: #2.002
INTERCUT WITH: 39. CONTINUED:
INTERCUT WITH: Diane, I received bad news today. Windom Earle has
INTERCUT WITH: vanished. Audrey Home is missing. There is of course no
INTERCUT WITH: connection, except for the simple fact that my former
INTERCUT WITH: partner's disappearance seems to matter less to me than
INTERCUT WITH: that of a troublesome high school girl.
INTERCUT WITH: Mr. Home is convinced she has run away and will return.
INTERCUT WITH: I wish I shared his confidence. Though not his callous
INTERCUT WITH: indifference.
INTERCUT WITH: An all-points bulletin, routine checks of the train car and
INTERCUT WITH: Jacques' cabin have revealed nothing. Not a trace of her.
INTERCUT WITH: Cooper shuts off the recorder. As if to wonder. Then he starts it again. Speaks more softly:
INTERCUT WITH: Audrey's absence touches me in ways I did not predict. I
INTERCUT WITH: find myself thinking not of clues or evidence, but of the
INTERCUT WITH: content of her smile. The way it gives the lie to her
INTERCUT WITH: delinquent posing, the hardened exterior which I suspect
INTERCUT WITH: is more a matter of self-preservation than a heart that is
INTERCUT WITH: cold. Audrey's heart is warm.
INTERCUT WITH: Cooper flicks off the recorder. Sets it on his bedside table. just then: a knock at the door.
INTERCUT WITH: Just a minute.
INTERCUT WITH: #2.002
INTERCUT WITH: 39. CONTINUED
INTERCUT WITH: Cooper rises with a wince - his wounds still give pain - and steps to the door. The last
INTERCUT WITH: time he opened it, Cooper received three slugs in the chest. This time he finds Major Briggs
INTERCUT WITH: standing there.
INTERCUT WITH: Major Briggs.
INTERCUT WITH: May I come in?
INTERCUT WITH: Please.
INTERCUT WITH: Briggs enters, Cooper gestures toward the room's single chair. Briggs sits.
INTERCUT WITH: I have a message for you.
INTERCUT WITH: From whom?
INTERCUT WITH: I am not at liberty to reveal the nature of my work. This
INTERCUT WITH: secrecy pains me from time to time. Any bureaucracy
INTERCUT WITH: that functions in secret inevitably lends itself to
INTERCUT WITH: corruption. But these are the rules I have pledged to
INTERCUT WITH: uphold. I believe a pledge is sacred.
INTERCUT WITH: Speaking as both a man and a fellow employee of the
INTERCUT WITH: federal government so do I.
INTERCUT WITH: I may reveal this much. Among my many tasks is the
INTERCUT WITH: maintenance of deep space monitors aimed at galaxies
INTERCUT WITH: beyond our own. We routinely receive various
INTERCUT WITH: communications, space garbage to decode and examine.
INTERCUT WITH: The results look something like this.
INTERCUT WITH: Briggs produces a paper readout, holds it out for Cooper to examine. The sheet is covered
INTERCUT WITH: with letters, numbers, signifying nothing.
INTERCUT WITH: Radio waves and gibberish, Agent Cooper. Until Friday
INTERCUT WITH: night. Saturday morning, to be exact.
INTERCUT WITH: When I was shot.
INTERCUT WITH: #2.002
INTERCUT WITH: 39. CONTINUED:
INTERCUT WITH: The readout took us by surprise.
INTERCUT WITH: Briggs holds out another paper readout, the usual jumbled numbers and letters. And a
INTERCUT WITH: message at its center: THE OWLS ARE NOT WHAT THEY SEEM. Cooper examines
INTERCUT WITH: the message, wonders:
INTERCUT WITH: Why did you bring this to me?
INTERCUT WITH: Briggs holds out one last readout.
INTERCUT WITH: Later that morning.
INTERCUT WITH: Cooper looks at the paper. More letters, numbers. And something else, quite recognizable,
INTERCUT WITH: repeated over and over. COOPER. COOPER. COOPER. Cooper reacts, exchanges a
INTERCUT WITH: look with Briggs.
INTERCUT WITH: 39A.OMITTED
INTERCUT WITH: 39B.INT. COOPER'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
INTERCUT WITH: FADE IN. The darkened bedroom. The phone RINGS. Cooper turns on a bedside light,
INTERCUT WITH: answers it.
INTERCUT WITH: Agent Cooper.
INTERCUT WITH: AUDREY'S VOICE
INTERCUT WITH: I know who it is.
INTERCUT WITH: Audrey. Where are you?
INTERCUT WITH: Helping you. just like I said.
INTERCUT WITH: This is not the time or place for schoolgirl games. I want
INTERCUT WITH: you to come home.
INTERCUT WITH: #2.002
INTERCUT WITH: 39B.CONTINUED:
INTERCUT WITH: Keep your shirt on. I'll be back before you know it.
INTERCUT WITH: Wait'll you hear what I found out.
INTERCUT WITH: Audrey, if you're in any kind of trouble...
INTERCUT WITH: Trouble? Never.
INTERCUT WITH: You look real cute in your tuxedo. Like a movie star.
INTERCUT WITH: With that she hangs up.
INTERCUT WITH: Audrey? Audrey?
INTERCUT WITH: 40. INT. ONE-EYED JACKS - NIGHT
INTERCUT WITH: Audrey sets down the receiver. She turns, reacts. BLACKIE and Emory Battis stand before
INTERCUT WITH: her.
INTERCUT WITH: Trouble, Miss Home? You don't know trouble. Not by
INTERCUT WITH: half
INTERCUT WITH: Audrey looks left and right. No exit. Trapped.
INTERCUT WITH: THE END
