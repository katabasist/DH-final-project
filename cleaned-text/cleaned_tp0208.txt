Donna, James, come on in ...
They enter the living room
We just came by to say goodbye to Maddy.
Oh, I'm sorry, you just missed her. I dropped her
off at the bus station not twenty minutes ago.
She's gone?
Donna looks, at James, trying to get a read on his reaction.
Yes. She thought you were coming by last night.
James and Donna glance at each other.
Did she say anything?
I'd have to say she was a little disappointed -
Sarah calls from upstairs.
Leland?

He goes halfway up the stairs. Donna and James look at each other.
I'm glad we were together last night, and I'm not
sorry we missed her, are you?
No.
Leland returns.
You could try writing, I'm sure she'd love to hear
from you. Do you have her address?
Yes. Sorry to have bothered you.
No bother, say hi to your folks for me, Donna.
She nods, Leland walks them to the door and they leave. From off screen ...

it into the light rough. Close, but no cigar. He carries a cellular phone.

Norma sets the plate down in front of TOAD. Vivian inspects it.
I trust those are real potatoes and not flakes.
Real potatoes. What a nice ... what a surprise.
Before Toad can take a bite Vivian reaches over, takes a fork from the counter and tests his
potatoes.
Hmm, very good. I see they taught Henry a skill in

Hank's ... not here right now.

Vivian starts to walk along the counter, checking out the place.
Mother, if you don't mind my asking, what are you

Norma takes the coffee to Ernie.

Norma takes a shot at a smile, comes up a little short. Ernie's off the phone, comes over, sets
his paper and cup down on the counter.
Norma, looking forward to spending more time
with you. Do they have cellular service in the car.
Vivian, if it's all right with you we should check in,
there's a Tokyo fax wait for me at the desk.
We'll be at the Northern, dear. Sorry we missed
Henry. I'll call later.
Vivian and Ernie leave. Norma picks up the paper Ernie left behind. Notices that he wasn't
looking at the Dow Jones, but rather the spread sheet from the USA TODAY sports section

The deputy opens the cell door. Jerry hands him a small Japanese flag. Jerry, steps inside. The
deputy closes the door and leaves. The Brothers look at each other for a long moment.

They suddenly embrace long and hard, then step back.
Ben, since your regular mouthpiece has been charged
with murder himself, I'm going to handle your case

windows shut, I want two men on his door
Hawk takes Gerard and escorts him out.
No ... no ...
They leave. Ben cooly eyes Truman.
You two bit lumberjack, you're finished in this town!
Be quiet!
Everyone is. Cooper looks at Harry and smiles.

Harry, I think we better talk outside.
Truman hesitates, finally nods yes, and walks out, followed by Cooper. Jerry starts to rub
Ben's shoulder's, speaking softly in warm soothing tones.
INT. DOWNSTAIRS CORRIDOR - NIGHT
Cooper and Truman step into the corridor.
Harry, I think we're saddling the horse here before
we're ready to ride.
I don't follow.
I don't think Ben Horne killed Laura Palmer.
What?
We should release him.
Coop, look, I've tried to help you every step of the
way, I've stood by you. But I have had just about
enough of giants, dwarfs, dreams and throwing rocks
at Tibetan milk bottles. Somebody does a crime,
it's my job to lock 'em up. And I cannot in good
conscience let a man walk from my jail who I think
is a killer! I can't do it.
Cooper looks at Harry, smiles.
You're right. This is your backyard. Sometimes an
outsider can forget that.
Cooper pats Harry on the arm. Walks away. We move in on Truman, wondering how and
why he won that battle so easily.

Establish.
INT. GREAT NORTHERN DINING ROOM - NIGHT
Close on Hank, gnawing on a huge beef rib, staring at Ernie. Vivian takes a bite of her
salmon, tastes it carefully.
Firm ... fresh ... just a little overcooked.
Mine too.
Hank smiles, barbecue sauce on his chin.
Just right.
Norma stands. The evening is not going well.
Will you excuse me for a moment?
I'll join you.
Ernie stands as they leave. Hank hurriedly rises as well, wiping off his chin.
Ladies ... hurry back.
They leave. Ernie stands for a moment then sits back down. Hank sets down the rib. They
study each other for a moment.
You're not going to say anything, are you? If Vivian
ever found out I was "inside," she'd leave me flat.
Hank begins to chuckle.
Ernie Niles. Ernie "The Professor" Niles.
So... when .. did you ...?
Revised 9-26-90, GREEN
#2.008 34.
Couple weeks. But let me tell you Ernie, without
you to pal around with, those last six months were
sheer hell. Nobody to go to the library with...
nobody to stamp license plates with...
Hank puts a hand on Ernie's shoulder, gives him a rough shake. Ernie tries to smile, but
Hank clearly makes him nervous.
So what's the angle here with Miss Moneybags,
anyway?
There's no angle.
Come on, buddy, we never had any secrets. Vivian's
rolling in dough.
Vivian and I met at a Republican fundraiser. We're
married.
You musta told her some tall tale. A whopper.
I am trying very hard to tell nothing but the truth
these days. It's therapeutic.
Vivian wants me to handle all her investments.
What about yours? You gonna introduce her to your
loansharks?
I'm out of it, Hank. I don't gamble anymore. I go
to meetings. I go to church, too.
So does Vivian know you ran off with the
congregation's picnic fund?
I would never steal from a church. It was a savings
and loan. I was sick, it was an illness and I've paid
my debt. It's a new life. A clean slate.

So she doesn't know.
You know, Ernie, this is interesting to me because
family is the most important thing in the world to
me. And one must be prepared to pay any price ...
to protect it. Wouldn't you agree?
I completely agree.
We'll talk some more, Ernie. I always enjoyed our
talks out in the yard - Man to man, prisoner to
prisoner.
Norma and Vivian return, Ernie rises abruptly. Hank more leisurely.
We're back.
I'd like to propose a toast ... to the newlyweds and
their happiness.
Thank you, Henry. What a nice gesture.
To Ernie and Vivian ... may the future bring them
much success.
... in all their future dealings.
They all drink, Hank gulps his. We move in on Norma watching Hank and Ernie's reaction.
She senses something's up.
INT. HALLWAY GREAT NORTHERN - NIGHT
Moving slowly down the hallway toward a door, we stop, room 315.

INT. COOPER'S ROOM - NIGHT
We pull back from the curtains, blowing in the wind, pass over an untouched piece of pie,
stop on a shirtless Cooper, changing the dressing on his wound, still wearing his shoulder
holster. He picks up his mini recorder.
Diane, 11:05, pm. Great Northern Hotel. Not a
star in the sky tonight. Ben Horne's in custody. If
the Great Northern grieves it bears its sadness in
silence ... the trail narrows, Diane. I'm close, but the
last few steps are always the darkest and most
difficult ...
A gust of wind wildly blows the curtains. Cooper, turns looks at it, there's a knock on the
door. He turns off the recorder, picks up his gun from the table. Cautiously walks to the
door. Opens it. AUDREY stands looking at a shirtless Cooper, holding a gun.
Audrey.
They look at each other for a moment.
Can I come in? Talk?
Of course.
She enters. Cooper reholsters his gun, Audrey looks at his wound.
Is that where you got shot?
Yes.
She wants to reach out and touch it, but doesn't. Then embarrassed, turns around and looks
out the window.
You arrested him?
Yes.
Did he do it?
#2.008
That's for the court to decide.
What do you think?
What I think ... doesn't matter right now.
Did you arrest him because of... what I said?
Only in part.
But I helped.
Yes.
All I ever really wanted was for him to love me.
I'm sure he does.
He's ashamed of me ...
No.
Agent Cooper, when I was at One Eyed Jacks, I
never ... I never let anyone ...
You don't have to say anything.
Just so you know -
#2.008
I know.
She looks at him longingly. Starts to reach out to touch him. The phone rings. Pause.
I have to get that.
OK.
Cooper answers the phone.
Hello.
Where? How long ago? I'm on my way.
He hangs up, reaches for his shirt. Audrey senses the seriousness of the call.
What's wrong?
Audrey, want you to go to your room and lock the
door. Stay there.
Why?
No questions. Do this for me.
She looks into his eyes.
All right.
EXT. WATERFALL NIGHT
Water rushing, misting. A pool near the bottom of the falls. Flashlights. Hawk, Cooper,
Truman. Ambulance attendants. A body, alive or dead we're not sure, being pulled from the
water and laid on a stretcher.
#2.008
Coop ... it's Maddy Ferguson.
They watch the stretcher being carried away.
