REVISED: 1A. EXT. WOODS - DAY
REVISED: MAJOR BRIGGS sits in an armchair in the middle of a fog forest clearing. It's an odd
REVISED: image. As if it occurred inside his mind. Briggs' moods shifts with great alacrity, alternating
REVISED: between inchoate rambling and coherence, as if someone had popped his mental cork.
REVISED: I ... I remember stepping from the flames, a vague shape
REVISED: in the dark ... then nothing. Until I found myself standing
REVISED: by the cold remains of our campfire. Two days later.
REVISED: VOICES enter the Major's dreamscape. Dr. Hayward and Agent Cooper.
REVISED: HAYWARD'S VOICE
REVISED: Major, there are some new therapeutic techniques that
REVISED: might help us to break through your amnesia.
REVISED: My memories are immune to regression. I can feel
REVISED: them, they are palpable. The smell and sensations...
REVISED: everything is known to me. Yet somehow beyond my
REVISED: reach.
REVISED: COOPER'S VOICE
REVISED: Do you remember anything else?
REVISED: Very little. Save for one disturbing image. A giant
REVISED: owl. Pervasive.
REVISED: COOPER'S VOICE
REVISED: A giant owl. How big?
SUDDENLY: a flash of blinding LIGHT, the image of a screeching OWL flying fast
SUDDENLY: and low, and a second FLASH leading us to...
SUDDENLY: 1. INT. SHERIFF'S CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
SUDDENLY: Briggs seated in the same armchair inside the conference room. AGENT COOPER and
SUDDENLY: SHERIFF TRUMAN gather around him. DR. HAYWARD completes a physical exam, has
SUDDENLY: just snapped a poloroid of the Major's head - hence the second FLASH of light.
SUDDENLY: Enough to cloud my mind and memory.
SUDDENLY: #2.013.1 Revised 11-7-90, BLUE
SUDDENLY: 1. CONTINUED:
SUDDENLY: (receiving undeveloped print, reporting his
SUDDENLY: findings)
SUDDENLY: Three triangular scars behind his right ear. In perfect
SUDDENLY: proportion.
SUDDENLY: Major Briggs, exactly what kind of work do you do?
SUDDENLY: That information is, as I have repeated endlessly to
SUDDENLY: myself ... classified. Though the keeping of secrets
SUDDENLY: seems less meaningful to me now.
SUDDENLY: Perhaps there are sources of information that transcend
SUDDENLY: the human need to conspire. Information of such weight
SUDDENLY: that it pertains not to the ...
SUDDENLY: My God, is this meant for the soul, my soul ...?
SUDDENLY: Maybe you should start at the beginning.
SUDDENLY: Are you familiar with Project Blue Book?
SUDDENLY: The Air Force project dedicated to the investigation of
SUDDENLY: Unidentified Flying Objects.
SUDDENLY: Officially disbanded in 1969. But there are those of us
SUDDENLY: who continue in an unofficial capacity. Examining the
SUDDENLY: heavens as before. And, in the case of Twin Peaks, the
SUDDENLY: earth below.
SUDDENLY: We are searching for a place called the White Lodge -
SUDDENLY: Cooper reacts, remembers Hawk's stories. But before he can answer... a knock at the door,
SUDDENLY: followed by the entrance of two stern UNIFORMED MP'S.
SUDDENLY: MP #1
SUDDENLY: Major Briggs?
SUDDENLY: #2.013.1 Revised 11-7-90, BLUE
SUDDENLY: 1. CONTINUED:
SUDDENLY: I've been expecting you.
SUDDENLY: Briggs rises to join them. The MP's mean to escort him to the door. Truman protests.
SUDDENLY: Now wait just one minute...
SUDDENLY: MP #1
SUDDENLY: Colonel Reilly's orders.
SUDDENLY: I'm afraid we will have to continue this discussion at a
SUDDENLY: later date. Goodbye.
SUDDENLY: With that, the MP's lead Briggs from the room. Hayward looks at the poloroid, now
SUDDENLY: developed. He hands it to Agent Cooper. Three scars behind the Majors right ear in perfect
SUDDENLY: proportion. Just then: a drop of WATER falls from above, splatters upon the image From a
SUDDENLY: fire sprinkler overhead. Just like the one that heralded Bob's flight to freedom.
SUDDENLY: 2. HARRY'S OFFICE - DAY
SUDDENLY: ERNIE NILES stares at the telephone on Truman's desk as if, it was his worst enemy.
SUDDENLY: DENISE BRYSON stands nearby, gestures toward it.
SUDDENLY: Go ahead, Ernie. It won't bite.
SUDDENLY: A lot you know. We're dealing with a murderous thug
SUDDENLY: here. Not that I haven't had plenty of dealings with his
SUDDENLY: kind before. Jean Renault is a hard man, but I've known
SUDDENLY: men who'd make him quiver -
SUDDENLY: Ernie.
SUDDENLY: All right, all right, all right.
SUDDENLY: Ernie picks up the receiver. Just then: Cooper and Truman step into the room. Startled, Ernie
SUDDENLY: returns the receiver to its cradle with a resounding SLAM.
SUDDENLY: Sorry.
SUDDENLY: #2.013.1 Revised 11-7-90, BLUE
SUDDENLY: 2. CONTINUED:
SUDDENLY: Setting the buy?
SUDDENLY: Trying to. Ernie's a little gunshy.
SUDDENLY: Gunshy? Ernie Niles is bold as bold can be. Let me at
SUDDENLY: him.
SUDDENLY: Please don't make me do this. This is suicide. I know.
SUDDENLY: I'm begging you, please. I don't want to. I'm begging.
SUDDENLY: Denise deadpans, gestures toward the telephone. A long beat. Ernie sighs, dials. Someone
SUDDENLY: answers. He pales a bit, pauses, then, meekly:
SUDDENLY: May I please speak to Jean Renault?
SUDDENLY: 3. A STATION CORRIDOR - DAY
SUDDENLY: Deputy ANDY BRENNEN enters a corridor, finds Tremayne waiting for him.
SUDDENLY: Andrew, where have you been?
SUDDENLY: Cat in tree.
SUDDENLY: A peace officer's work is never done. Lucky for us my
SUDDENLY: efforts bore more palatable fruit.
SUDDENLY: I paid the Happy Helping Hand adoption agency a visit
SUDDENLY: where several blue-haired ladies were only too happy to
SUDDENLY: sup from my open palm. Unfortunately, all of Little
SUDDENLY: Nicky's records had been sealed and returned to the
SUDDENLY: Orphanage.
SUDDENLY: We'll never know what really happened to Little Nicky's
SUDDENLY: parents.
SUDDENLY: Courage, Andrew. Do not despair. Next stop: that
SUDDENLY: selfsame Orphanage. And Little Nicky's records
SUDDENLY: within.
SUDDENLY: #2.013.1 Revised 11-7-90, BLUE
SUDDENLY: 3. CONTINUED:
SUDDENLY: Maybe we should tell Lucy.
SUDDENLY: Absolutely not. Our investigation into Nicky's past
SUDDENLY: must proceed sub rosa. This, dear boy, is strictly a
SUDDENLY: man's job.
SUDDENLY: Follow me.
SUDDENLY: Andy and Tremayne exit. Lucy peeks out of her cubicle, curious. All she SEES is Agent
SUDDENLY: Cooper as he approaches. Cooper wonders:
SUDDENLY: Any luck, Lucy?
SUDDENLY: I checked the personals columns in every national
SUDDENLY: newspaper on the list and I didn't find anything that
SUDDENLY: looked like a chess thing or any mention of the name
SUDDENLY: Windom Earle. Sorry.
SUDDENLY: Cooper gives Lucy an encouraging pat, and turns toward the door.
SUDDENLY: 4. EXT. DOUBLE R DINER - DAY
SUDDENLY: 5. OMITTED
SUDDENLY: 5A. INT. DOUBLE R DINER - DAY
SUDDENLY: ED HURLEY finishes breakfast at the counter. NORMA JENNINGS hands him his check.
SUDDENLY: The latter occurs under the watchful eye of HANK JENNINGS, standing to the rear.
SUDDENLY: Everything all right, Ed?
SUDDENLY: Just fine, thanks. For you.
SUDDENLY: Ed rises, hands her a bill. And a NOTE beneath it. Norma reacts, tucks the note into her apron.
SUDDENLY: #2.013 Revised 11-16-90, CHERRY
SUDDENLY: 5. CONTINUED:
SUDDENLY: 'Bye now
SUDDENLY: They exchange a meaningful glance. Ed exits. And behind them, his eyes dark with anger and
SUDDENLY: suspicion, Hank watches every single move.
SUDDENLY: 6. MIKE AT THE COUNTER
SUDDENLY: MIKE NELSON enjoys a morning cup of coffee. His respite is shattered by the sudden
SUDDENLY: appearance of NADINE HURLEY at the stool beside him.
SUDDENLY: Good morning, Mike Nelson!
SUDDENLY: Oh, Lord.
SUDDENLY: Wanna share a soda? How about a nice big piece of
SUDDENLY: cherry pie. Two forks.
SUDDENLY: Mrs. Hurley, Nadine, I want my own piece of cherry pie.
SUDDENLY: In fact, I want two pieces of cherry pie for myself
SUDDENLY: Okay. Meat loaf!
SUDDENLY: Cherry pie and coffee. In fact, sixteen cups of coffee.
SUDDENLY: I don't want to talk with you. I don't want to walk with
SUDDENLY: you. I don't want to see you. I don't want to know you.
SUDDENLY: Is that clear enough to understand? Or will I need a
SUDDENLY: court order to get my point across?
SUDDENLY: A long beat. Nadine's worldview severely challenged. She bows her head for a beat,
SUDDENLY: chastised. Then looks up, the light of love not yet extinguished in her eyes.
SUDDENLY: Mike Nelson you are the handsomest boy I've ever
SUDDENLY: known. And I would really like it if you and I could go
SUDDENLY: out on a date.
SUDDENLY: A beat of stunned silence. Suddenly - Nadine gives Mike a kiss. Deep, much deeper than he
SUDDENLY: has ever been kissed before. And more sexual than the kisses of a hundred high school girls.
SUDDENLY: 2.013
SUDDENLY: 6. CONTINUED:
SUDDENLY: Finally, Nadine releases him, beams.
SUDDENLY: Sorry. Sometimes I can't help myself.
SUDDENLY: Mike pauses, stunned. By both the kiss ... and how much he liked it.
SUDDENLY: 7. HANK JENNINGS
SUDDENLY: HANK enters from the kitchen, carrying an order. He pauses to watch NORMA
SUDDENLY: JENNINGS grab car keys and purse from a shelf beneath the register.
SUDDENLY: Where're you headed?
SUDDENLY: I've got a couple errands.
SUDDENLY: Little early for errands, isn't it? We've still got most of
SUDDENLY: the breakfast crowd.
SUDDENLY: Think of this as a test, Hank. Just you, an a kitchen full
SUDDENLY: of scrambled eggs. I'll be right back.
SUDDENLY: Norma exits. Hank watches her go. She lied to him and he knows it.
SUDDENLY: 8. EXT. LEO JOHNSON'S HOUSE - DAY
SUDDENLY: 9. INT. LEO JOHNSON'S HOUSE - DAY
SUDDENLY: SHELLY JOHNSON directs a spoonful of cereal into LEO JOHNSON's mouth. But Leo
SUDDENLY: sputters, gurgles, and half the cereal spews out upon the table. And Shelly.
SUDDENLY: Dammit. It's your turn to feed him.
SUDDENLY: BOBBY BRIGGS, seated opposite, looks up from his paper. Like a beleaguered husband no
SUDDENLY: longer satisfied with happy memories.
SUDDENLY: #2.013.1 Revised 11-7-90, BLUE
SUDDENLY: 9. CONTINUED:
SUDDENLY: I got practice.
SUDDENLY: Football season is over.
SUDDENLY: This is baseball, baby. Our national pastime.
SUDDENLY: Okay. Then you can wash him when you get back.
SUDDENLY: I'm not coming back.
SUDDENLY: What did you say?
SUDDENLY: You're lookin' at Ben Horne's brand new boy. Do the
SUDDENLY: words "golden opportunity" mean anything to you? This
SUDDENLY: is my big break. And I've got better things to do than
SUDDENLY: give Leo Johnson a bubble bath.
SUDDENLY: And what about me? Don't I have anything better to do?
SUDDENLY: Not that I can think of.
SUDDENLY: He didn't mean it. Shelly SLAPS him hard across the face. Bobby stares at her for a beat.
SUDDENLY: Then turns and walks out the door. Shelly yells after:
SUDDENLY: Bobby!!!!
SUDDENLY: 10. INT./EXT. MARSH GARAGE - DAY
SUDDENLY: JAMES HURLEY at the garage phone. He dials, waits.
SUDDENLY: Uncle Ed? Yeah, it's me ... I'm okay. Listen. I need a
SUDDENLY: favor. Get the money out of my savings account,
SUDDENLY: whatever's left. And send it care of me to The Broken
SUDDENLY: Bones, it's a bar out on 96...
SUDDENLY: #2.013.1 Revised 11-7-90, BLUE
SUDDENLY: 10. CONTINUED:
SUDDENLY: James senses someone close by, looks up. It's EVELYN MARSH, standing quite still in the
SUDDENLY: garage doorway. She wears dark sunglasses. James stares at her for a beat, returns to Big Ed on
SUDDENLY: the phone.
SUDDENLY: ... I can't explain. I'll call you later. Got to go.
SUDDENLY: James lowers the receiver from his lips. Evelyn steps closer, she smiles.
SUDDENLY: Long distance?
SUDDENLY: Twin Peaks.
SUDDENLY: Are you homesick, James?
SUDDENLY: No.
SUDDENLY: Evelyn runs her hand along the Jaguar's sleek lines. As she approaches, James can see a bruise
SUDDENLY: beneath her right eye. A wound the sunglasses cannot completely hide.
SUDDENLY: Tell me about Twin Peaks.
SUDDENLY: There isn't much to say.
SUDDENLY: You could start with why you left. A woman, as I recall.
SUDDENLY: Two of them.
SUDDENLY: Evelyn's keeping it light. A gentle flirtation. James responds quietly, lets a secret out of his
SUDDENLY: heart.
SUDDENLY: I loved a girl who died.
SUDDENLY: Evelyn stops still to face him.
SUDDENLY: Her name was Laura. I thought I knew her but I didn't.
SUDDENLY: Nobody did.
SUDDENLY: #2.013 Revised 11-7-90, BLUE
SUDDENLY: 10. CONTINUED:
SUDDENLY: I'm sorry.
SUDDENLY: My life used to make sense, you know? I didn't like it
SUDDENLY: all the time. But it was mine and I felt like it belonged
SUDDENLY: to me. Then Laura died. And the whole world went
SUDDENLY: crazy. Suddenly my life belonged to something else.
SUDDENLY: To Laura. And no matter what I did, or how much I
SUDDENLY: tried to help, and I tried, I really did...
SUDDENLY: Another girl died. And all I wanted to do was get on
SUDDENLY: my bike and ride as far away from Twin Peaks as it
SUDDENLY: would take me.
SUDDENLY: James pauses, deeply shaken. Evelyn steps to him, takes James into her arms. A long beat.
SUDDENLY: She whispers:
SUDDENLY: I know the feeling, James. I know the feeling.
SUDDENLY: Their mouths come closer together, awkward, shy. They kiss. James gently removes her
SUDDENLY: sunglasses. He wants to see into her eyes. A long beat. James traces the bruise on her check
SUDDENLY: with his fingertips.
SUDDENLY: Why do you let him hurt you?
SUDDENLY: Evelyn takes his hand, presses it against her lips. She will not answer. Instead, she kisses James
SUDDENLY: with great passion. Their embrace deepens. Suddenly: the SOUND of a car pulling up the drive.
SUDDENLY: Evelyn steps out of James' arms, looks to the main house. MALCOM steps out of a limousine,
SUDDENLY: pauses to shoot a warning glance in their direction. Then proceeds inside.
SUDDENLY: Jeffrey's leaving.
SUDDENLY: Evelyn turns back to James, whispers before leaving.
SUDDENLY: I need you. Will you help me?
SUDDENLY: Evelyn hurries out of the garage without waitin for an answer. HOLD ON James for a beat.
SUDDENLY: Considering his reply.

SUDDENLY: 12. INT. BLUE PINE LODGE - DAY
SUDDENLY: JOSIE PACKARD answers a knock at the kitchen door. It's Sheriff Truman.
SUDDENLY: Harry.
SUDDENLY: Two days, Josie. Two nights. And not a word.
SUDDENLY: I'm sorry.
SUDDENLY: What the hell are you doing here?
SUDDENLY: This is my home.
SUDDENLY: After everything you told me? Home with Catherine?!
SUDDENLY: I have no choice.
SUDDENLY: Josie turns from him, she cannot bear his gaze. But he reaches after, pulls her into his arms.
SUDDENLY: Let me take care of you. Please.
SUDDENLY: Don't you understand? I'm safe here. And you are safe as
SUDDENLY: well.
SUDDENLY: No.
SUDDENLY: Look at me. I am Catherine Packard's maid.
SUDDENLY: Go away, Harry. I'm no good for you now.
SUDDENLY: Truman steps closer, he sees the servant's clothing, the tears that shine in her eyes.
SUDDENLY: I want you. Good or bad. I don't care.
SUDDENLY: #2.013.1 Revised 11-7-90, BLUE
SUDDENLY: 12. CONTINUED:
SUDDENLY: Truman reaches for her blouse, unfastens it.
SUDDENLY: Harry ...
SUDDENLY: I want you.
SUDDENLY: With that, Truman removes her blouse; she reaches for his shirt, they begin to make love.
SUDDENLY: FADE OUT.
SUDDENLY: #2.013.1 Revised 11-7-90, BLUE
SUDDENLY: 13. INT. GREAT NORTHERN CORRIDOR - DAY
SUDDENLY: AUDREY HORNE wanders down the corridor outside her father's office. She pauses, hears
SUDDENLY: Ben shouting inside.
SUDDENLY: BEN'S VOICE
SUDDENLY: Dammit, Longstreet. We may have come to this
SUDDENLY: godforsaken town in search of shoes, but we will leave it
SUDDENLY: with Grant on his knees, and our sights set on
SUDDENLY: Washington!
SUDDENLY: Audrey reacts, steps toward the office door.
SUDDENLY: 14. INT. GREAT NORTHERN HOTEL - DAY
SUDDENLY: Audrey enters, finds an amazing tableau within. BEN HORNE has transformed the floor of
SUDDENLY: his office into a huge diorama depicting the Battle of Gettysburg, complete with rolling hills,
SUDDENLY: tiny trees, miniature soldiers in uniform. And a chugging train that hoots about the periphery.
SUDDENLY: Lost in combat, Ben holds two toy soldiers, continues a conversation between them. Ben is
SUDDENLY: dressed in the requisite finery of a Southern General.
SUDDENLY: Yessir, General Lee.
SUDDENLY: Longstreet, I want you to lead the assault on the Round
SUDDENLY: Tops. Ewell will take Culp's Hill -
SUDDENLY: Daddy ... ?
SUDDENLY: Yes, Culp's Hill, are you deaf? And where's Jeb Stuart
SUDDENLY: and his calvary?! Damn his eyes!!
SUDDENLY: Jeb's a-comin', Sir. I know it.
SUDDENLY: He'd better be. For all our sakes. We meet the enemy
SUDDENLY: here. And we meet him by morning.
SUDDENLY: DADDY!!
SUDDENLY: Horne freezes, looks up from battle. Wild-eyed and disheveled.
SUDDENLY: #2.013 Revised 11-12-90, YELLOW
SUDDENLY: 14. CONTINUED:
SUDDENLY: Suddenly it's daybreak.
SUDDENLY: What in the world are you doing?
SUDDENLY: THERE'S A CIVIL WAR GOING ON HERE.
SUDDENLY: War?
SUDDENLY: The war between the states. And who are you?
SUDDENLY: Audrey, your daughter, and you need some help.
SUDDENLY: Thank you but I just want to be left alone, this is an
SUDDENLY: important day.
SUDDENLY: This is an important day, alright, we've got a business to
SUDDENLY: save. You and me. And I am going to help you.
SUDDENLY: Audrey?
SUDDENLY: Yes, Daddy?
SUDDENLY: You're standing on General Stuart.
SUDDENLY: She moves. Ben snatches the soldier from under her feet.
SUDDENLY: We spotted ol' Jeb, General Lee. He brought us a
SUDDENLY: hundred and twenty-five wagons.
SUDDENLY: #2.013.1 Revised 11-7-90, BLUE
SUDDENLY: 14. CONTINUED:
SUDDENLY: Fool, I have no use for wagons! I need my eyes and ears
SUDDENLY: beside me. Bring me General Stuart!! Ready the good
SUDDENLY: men of the Alabama 15th!! On to Victory!!
SUDDENLY: Audrey can't believe it. She holds back a sob, turns and runs from the office. Leaving her
SUDDENLY: father - and the Civil War - behind. Ben doesn't notice.
SUDDENLY: 15. INT. HURLEY HOUSE - DAY
SUDDENLY: BIG ED HURLEY steps nervously about the living room, checks a clock on the knickknack
SUDDENLY: shelf. Just then: a KNOCK at the door. Ed answers it. Norma steps inside, still wearing her
SUDDENLY: Double R uniform. An awkward beat. Neither sure just what to say or do. Then:
SUDDENLY: Norma, I've been thinking -
SUDDENLY: Ed, I came here so I could -
SUDDENLY: You first.
SUDDENLY: Okay. When I go to bed, you're the last thing I think of.
SUDDENLY: When I wake up, you're the first thing on
SUDDENLY: my mind. I know the world's gone to pieces. And I
SUDDENLY: know it all seems designed to keep us apart. But there's
SUDDENLY: one thing bad luck never takes into account. We love
SUDDENLY: each other, Ed. And I think we have to stand up to that.
SUDDENLY: No matter what.
SUDDENLY: A beat. Ed takes her into his arms, they kiss deeply.
SUDDENLY: Your turn.
SUDDENLY: Ed?
SUDDENLY: Later.
SUDDENLY: Norma smiles, returns his kisses with greater fervor.

SUDDENLY: 19. INT. SHERIFF TRUMAN'S OFFICE - DAY
SUDDENLY: START CLOSE on hands attaching a hidden microphone to a rather sweaty chest. A
SUDDENLY: protesting voice is heard. Ernie Niles.
SUDDENLY: ERNIE'S VOICE
SUDDENLY: Careful. Watch the chest hair. Ouch.
SUDDENLY: ANOTHER ANGLE reveals Sheriff Truman, Agent Cooper. And DEPUTY HAWK
SUDDENLY: fitting Niles with the wire, putting baby powder on his chest.
SUDDENLY: You're sweating like a pig, Mr. Niles.
SUDDENLY: I suffer from nervous perspiration. Hyperhidrosis. It's a
SUDDENLY: childhood condition. Though I never really noticed it
SUDDENLY: until the war ...
SUDDENLY: ... Korea. I was leading a battalion toward the forty-
SUDDENLY: ninth parallel. Just a bunch of young, fresh-faced kids,
SUDDENLY: no idea what kind of hell we were about to step into -
SUDDENLY: Ernie? Ernie, I want you focus on the here and now.
SUDDENLY: Repeat your instructions. Step by step.
SUDDENLY: I take Denise up to Dead Dog Farm, introduce her to
SUDDENLY: Renault as a big-time buyer from Seattle. I lead
SUDDENLY: Renault through the buy. Complete the transaction. And
SUDDENLY: get the hell out of the way.
SUDDENLY: Good. Harry? You'll take it from there.
SUDDENLY: Wish I could go in with you, but I've temporarily lost
SUDDENLY: my enforcement franchise.
SUDDENLY: #2.013
SUDDENLY: 19. CONTINUED:
SUDDENLY: I've been giving that some thought.
SUDDENLY: Truman reveals a Twin Peaks DEPUTY'S BADGE, hands it toward him.
SUDDENLY: Consider yourself deputized. The Bureau's loss is my
SUDDENLY: gain.
SUDDENLY: Thank you, Harry. I hope I can live up to it.
SUDDENLY: I'm done. Might want to towel him off before we go.
SUDDENLY: Just how long will it take you to storm the farmhouse? I
SUDDENLY: mean from the time I complete the buy? Maybe I
SUDDENLY: should be wearing a vest. Can I ask a question?
SUDDENLY: Sure, Ernie.
SUDDENLY: Don't make me do this. Please. I'm not the man you
SUDDENLY: think I am. I'm a coward. Really. This isn't my line of
SUDDENLY: work, I -
SUDDENLY: I'm fine. Sorry. A momentary lapse. Count on me.
SUDDENLY: Where's Denise?
SUDDENLY: Just then: Denise, or rather Dennis, enters the room. She's reverted back to male dress for the
SUDDENLY: occasion, hair tied neatly back in a ponytail.
SUDDENLY: DENISE/DENNIS
SUDDENLY: Right here.
SUDDENLY: Somehow it seemed ... appropriate.
SUDDENLY: Cooper offers an unfazed thumbs up.
SUDDENLY: 20. EXT. ORPHANAGE - DAY
SUDDENLY: A stately building among the pines.
SUDDENLY: #2.013
SUDDENLY: 21. INT. ORPHANAGE OFFICE -DAY
SUDDENLY: An empty office. Two or three cluttered desks. A series of file cabinets. Suddenly, the
SUDDENLY: sound of heated whispers outside, shadows playing across the office door's opaque window.
SUDDENLY: TREMAYNE'S VOICE
SUDDENLY: We may have to pick the lock. Tricky business, that.
SUDDENLY: Just then: the door opens, REVEALING Tremayne and Andy on the other side. Andy has
SUDDENLY: simply turned the knob of the unlocked door.
SUDDENLY: Voila. We enter.
SUDDENLY: Where is everybody?
SUDDENLY: Lunch.
SUDDENLY: Here we are ... the case files.
SUDDENLY: Tremayne leafs through the cabinet, reading names as he goes.
SUDDENLY: Nails, Neaster, Neatherby, Needleman. Nicholas
SUDDENLY: Needleman. Our little Nicky.
SUDDENLY: We can read it in the car.
SUDDENLY: Patience, Andrew ... Hmm. The usual background
SUDDENLY: information. Birthplace, initial adoption.
SUDDENLY: Dick.
SUDDENLY: The first of several, it seems. A-ha, the plot thickens.
SUDDENLY: Where are thy secrets, Little Nicky?
SUDDENLY: DICK.

SUDDENLY: Tremayne turns to the door. He sees a KINDLY COUPLE, the pleasant-faced HUSBAND.
SUDDENLY: Tremayne panicks, slams the file back inside the cabinet, banging his finger in the process.
SUDDENLY: Hi. We're the Brunston's. I know we're a little early.
SUDDENLY: But we were just so damn eager to see him ...
SUDDENLY: Can we see him? Where is Donnie?
SUDDENLY: Speechless, Andy simply points at Tremayne. Tremayne faces the unexpected guests, replies:
SUDDENLY: Dead.
SUDDENLY: The husband pales, the wife gasps. Tremayne improvises further.
SUDDENLY: Dead tired, that is. I'm afraid Donnie isn't feeling up to
SUDDENLY: snuff.
SUDDENLY: But he was in perfect health, yesterday.
SUDDENLY: Dick.
SUDDENLY: Just one minute. Let me help these good people. Now
SUDDENLY: where were we..?
SUDDENLY: Tremayne looks up at the inquisitive couple a supplicating look on his face.

SUDDENLY: Norma sits on the side of the bed, adjusts her stockings. Ed sits behind her, legs about her hips.
SUDDENLY: Are you happy?
SUDDENLY: I love you, Norma. I'm hard pressed to think of
SUDDENLY: anything else that matters.
SUDDENLY: Norma smiles, kisses the arms that hold her. Suddenly: a KNOCK at the door. Both react.

SUDDENLY: Ed opens the door, finds DONNA HAYWARD standing there.
SUDDENLY: I need your help, Ed.
SUDDENLY: What can I do for you?
SUDDENLY: I've been looking for James everywhere. He hasn't been
SUDDENLY: in school. No one's seen him at the Diner. I even went
SUDDENLY: to his house but I can't find him.
SUDDENLY: Donna. Listen to me. James is all right. He called.
SUDDENLY: Tell me.
SUDDENLY: James asked me to send him some money care of a bar
SUDDENLY: out on 96. We didn't talk long ...
SUDDENLY: That's all I know.
SUDDENLY: Donna peers at the envelope for a beat. An address written there.
SUDDENLY: Let me take it to him.
SUDDENLY: What about your folks?
SUDDENLY: I'll speak to them. They'll understand.
SUDDENLY: Ed's not so sure, but Donna doesn't hesitate. She gives Ed a kiss on the cheek, exits. Ed pauses,
SUDDENLY: turns back to the bedroom. Norma's standing in the doorway. Both listen to the sound of
SUDDENLY: Donna's car driving away.
SUDDENLY: I've got to get back.
SUDDENLY: I'll call.
SUDDENLY: Norma steps into his arms, they kiss.

SUDDENLY: Norma exits. Ed pauses to watch her go. Then, at last, he closes the door, turns back to the
SUDDENLY: living room ... and finds Hank Jennings standing before him.
SUDDENLY: Oh, Ed. The things we do for love.
SUDDENLY: Hank SLAMS his fist into Ed's jaw. Ed topples over backward. Hank leaps upon him. He'll
SUDDENLY: beat him to death if he can. Just then: someone OPENS the front door. Norma returning?
SUDDENLY: No. It's Nadine, carrying a satchel of books. Thinking about Mike. Thinking about Ed.
SUDDENLY: Thinking about her parents in Europe.
SUDDENLY: Eddie? I'm home!
SUDDENLY: Nadine SEES Hank and Big Ed. One looming over the other.
SUDDENLY: Eddie?
SUDDENLY: Hank turns to Nadine, revealing Ed below him, face bloodied and battered. Nadine reacts in
SUDDENLY: a flash. She leaps forward, swings her book satchel like a scimitar, bashing Hank in the head.
SUDDENLY: Hank yowls in protest, tries to avoid. But Nadine is stronger and faster than his darkest
SUDDENLY: nightmare. And now she turns the full force of her anger upon him.
SUDDENLY: Nadine batters Hank through the living room, pile-driving into a coffee table, hurling
SUDDENLY: him through the knickknack shelf, and with one last great punch...sends him careening over the
SUDDENLY: sofa. A beat of stunned silence. Hank lies still. Nadine hurries to Big Ed's side.
SUDDENLY: Eddie? Can you hear me?
SUDDENLY: Nadine?
SUDDENLY: Nadine's here. Don't worry, baby. Nadine will take
SUDDENLY: care of everything.

SUDDENLY: 26. INT. BEN HORNE'S OFFICE - DAY
SUDDENLY: A victorious Ben Horne, still in military raiment, eyes the battleground before him. Bobby
SUDDENLY: Briggs looks on with a sinking feeling. His big break is turning to sand before his eyes.
SUDDENLY: Colonel Chamberlain and the 20th Maine were trapped
SUDDENLY: at the summit of Little Round Top. A third of his men
SUDDENLY: already fallen. His one chance, his only chance, was to
SUDDENLY: take the offensive; to move his left flank down the
SUDDENLY: hillside, like a swinging gate and take us by surprise.
SUDDENLY: Uh, Mr. Horne..?
SUDDENLY: But we were waiting for him. The 15th Alabama
SUDDENLY: attacked before the left flank was able to muster.
SUDDENLY: Chamberlain's desperate manuever ended in failure
SUDDENLY: Little Round Top was ours. From this vantage point, we
SUDDENLY: were able to roll back the Federal line, setting the stage
SUDDENLY: for Pickett's mighty charge. And victory.
SUDDENLY: Victory. Oh boy.
SUDDENLY: Bobby looks to the door, Audrey peeking inside. He shrugs. What can I do? Meanwhile, Ben
SUDDENLY: produces a sword from behind his desk, hands it to Bobby with great fanfare.
SUDDENLY: General Meade, you have suffered in ignoble defeat. I
SUDDENLY: accept your unconditional surrender.
SUDDENLY: Bobby doesn't know what the hell to do. Ben wants him to hand the sword back.
SUDDENLY: General Meade. I accept your unconditional surrender.
SUDDENLY: Okay. Tell you what, Mr. Horne, I gotta go check with
SUDDENLY: President Lincoln first, okay? So you wait right here,

SUDDENLY: 26. CONTINUED:
SUDDENLY: and we'll get back to you on this surrender thing - hey,
SUDDENLY: don't wanna keep the President waiting.
SUDDENLY: Bobby makes a hasty exit, holding the sword.
SUDDENLY: 27. INT. GREAT NORTHERN CORRIDOR - DAY
SUDDENLY: Bobby exits from the office carrying the ceremonial sword, finds Audrey outside. They walk
SUDDENLY: down the corridor together.
SUDDENLY: Baby, I got good news and I got bad news. The bad
SUDDENLY: news is your old man just bought a condo in Flip City.
SUDDENLY: Ben is out to lunch. The good news is he's about to win
SUDDENLY: the Civil War.
SUDDENLY: I'll call Uncle Jerry. He'Il know what to do. And
SUDDENLY: Doctor Jacoby. Maybe he needs an injection. Bobby, I
SUDDENLY: don't care what it takes: we've got to get Ben Horne back
SUDDENLY: on his feet again.
SUDDENLY: Okay, baby. Whatever you say. Bobby's on the case.
SUDDENLY: That may work with Shelly. But not this girl. She deadpans:
SUDDENLY: Don't call me baby.
SUDDENLY: They turn the corner. Catherine Martell, who's overheard some of the exchange, steps around
SUDDENLY: the corner and heads for the office.
SUDDENLY: 28. INT. BEN HORNE'S OFFICE - DAY
SUDDENLY: Ben sits on the couch, enjoys a victory cigar. Someone knocks at the office door.

SUDDENLY: The door opens ... Catherine Martell steps inside.
SUDDENLY: Hello, Ben.
SUDDENLY: Ben reacts. She's a walking reality check, tearing Ben from fantasy's comforting embrace.
SUDDENLY: Catherine.
SUDDENLY: Gettysburg?
SUDDENLY: Yes ...
SUDDENLY: Only you could conceive of winning the Civil War. For the South.
SUDDENLY: I have Washington in my sights.
SUDDENLY: You have the nuthouse in your future if you don't snap out
SUDDENLY: of it.
SUDDENLY: So you've come to gloat. Come to celebrate my
SUDDENLY: demise. Go ahead, then. Laugh. You've defeated me.
SUDDENLY: Left me for dead. As I have defeated General Meade.
SUDDENLY: There's something wistful in Ben's expression. A kind of vulnerability Catherine's never seen
SUDDENLY: before. Catherine looks at Ben for a beat. Then, a little wistful herself.
SUDDENLY: True. I did come here to gloat. You double-crossed me.
SUDDENLY: You tried to kill me. And I, for the very best of reasons,
SUDDENLY: intended to bury you so deeply that future generations
SUDDENLY: would someday unearth and exhibit your remains:
SUDDENLY: Slimey Rat Bastard Americanus: DO NOT FEED.
SUDDENLY: DO NOT TRUST.
SUDDENLY: #2.013 Revised 11-7-90, BLUE
SUDDENLY: 28. CONTINUED:
SUDDENLY: I'm not all that trustworthy, I suppose.
SUDDENLY: Far from it. And yet, despite all the things I know,
SUDDENLY: despite every reason you've given me to despise you ... I
SUDDENLY: find myself here with you ... wanting you.
SUDDENLY: You can't be serious ...
SUDDENLY: I want you, Ben. Horrifying as it seems. I can't escape
SUDDENLY: it. You ... make my body hum.
SUDDENLY: Ben looks at her, speechless. Catherine reaches for him.
SUDDENLY: Now kiss me, General Lee.
SUDDENLY: Catherine pushes Ben down upon the soft couch. Both sides engage.
SUDDENLY: 29. EXT. MARSH GARAGE - DAY
SUDDENLY: Evelyn stands outside the garage, holding a bottle of champagne and two glasses. Eyes closed,
SUDDENLY: she waits; giddy, impatient.
SUDDENLY: Hurry up, "Jim." The champagne's getting warm.
SUDDENLY: JAMES' VOICE
SUDDENLY: Don't call me "Jim."
SUDDENLY: Suddenly: the ROAR of an engine from the garage. Evelyn opens her eyes. And James drives
SUDDENLY: into view behind the wheel of the gleaming Jaguar. Evelyn holds the champagne and glasses
SUDDENLY: into the air, triumphant. James pulls up beside her. He opens the passenger door, steps into
SUDDENLY: view. Presents the automobile with a grinning flourish.
SUDDENLY: Anyplace special you want to go?
SUDDENLY: Jeffrey'll be home by midnight. That doesn't give us a
SUDDENLY: lot of time.
SUDDENLY: #2.013 REVISED 11-7-90, BLUE
SUDDENLY: 29. CONTINUED:
SUDDENLY: I'll take what we got.
SUDDENLY: Deal.
SUDDENLY: James and Evelyn meet at the front of the Jaguar. The engine running. Evelyn pours two
SUDDENLY: glasses, hands one to James. They touch glasses. Evelyn proposes a toast.
SUDDENLY: To handsome strangers and rebuilt engines.
SUDDENLY: James downs his glass with a flourish. Evelyn grins, does the same.
SUDDENLY: I never thought I'd see it ride again. You're a miracle-
SUDDENLY: worker.
SUDDENLY: It was nothing. Honest.
SUDDENLY: You're too modest.
SUDDENLY: I don't want to brag.
SUDDENLY: Oh, go ahead. You deserve it. You're strong and you're
SUDDENLY: kind. You have a wonderfully honest face, James. Don't
SUDDENLY: laugh, it's quite rare. Every time I look at you, I can tell
SUDDENLY: exactly what you're thinking.
SUDDENLY: Guess I ought to be careful about what I'm thinking.
SUDDENLY: Don't be careful. Not on my account.
SUDDENLY: Evelyn pours herself another glass, hands the bottle to James.
SUDDENLY: What are your plans?
SUDDENLY: #2.013 Revised 11-8-90, PINK
SUDDENLY: 29. CONTINUED:
SUDDENLY: I haven't thought about it.
SUDDENLY: Where will you go?
SUDDENLY: I don't know.
SUDDENLY: Don't.
SUDDENLY: What?
SUDDENLY: I don't want you to leave. Give me time, James. I'll
SUDDENLY: think of a hundred reasons for you to stay.
SUDDENLY: Evelyn kisses him. Their passion increases. James begins to remove her blouse. Evelyn reaches
SUDDENLY: for his belt. James eases her down upon on the Jaguar hood, the engine still running hot beneath
SUDDENLY: them. Evelyn smiles, giddy, she whispers:
SUDDENLY: It 's warm.
SUDDENLY: HOLD ON James and Evelyn for a beat. ANOTHER ANGLE reveals Malcolm watching
SUDDENLY: from the garage. And he's smiling.

SUDDENLY: about in the wind. The drug buy in progress. As SEEN through a pair of binoculars.
SUDDENLY: 31. EXT. DEAD DOG FARM BLUFF - DAY
SUDDENLY: Deputy Hawk sits in a police cruiser, wearing a headset, manning the radio and taping controls.
SUDDENLY: Sheriff Truman and Agent Cooper recline atop a small bluff, peer through binoculars at Dead
SUDDENLY: Dog Farm. Both wear portable earpieces. INTERCUT their POV as they watch and listen

SUDDENLY: ERNIE'S VOICE
SUDDENLY: You sure you don't want to wait for Hank? He told me
SUDDENLY: this morning how much he wanted to be in on everything.
SUDDENLY: I feel pretty strongly we should wait a couple more -
SUDDENLY: RENAULT'S VOICE
SUDDENLY: We'll start without him.
SUDDENLY: ERNIE'S VOICE
SUDDENLY: Whatever you say. Dennis ... ?
SUDDENLY: DENNIS'S VOICE
SUDDENLY: May I?
SUDDENLY: RENAULT'S VOICE
SUDDENLY: You're sweating awful bad, Professor. Something wrong?
SUDDENLY: ERNIE'S VOICE
SUDDENLY: Me? Sweating? Hyperhidrosis. It's a childhood
SUDDENLY: condition. I was living in Guam at the time, contracted
SUDDENLY: yellow fever. The. aftereffects are vicious, as you can
SUDDENLY: imagine, heavy sweating's one of the socially
SUDDENLY: inconvenient -
SUDDENLY: DENNIS'S VOICE
SUDDENLY: Everything's in order. I've got a plane to catch, so if we
SUDDENLY: can finish up...
SUDDENLY: KING'S VOICE
SUDDENLY: Sit down, Ernie. Take a deep breath.
SUDDENLY: RENAULT'S VOICE
SUDDENLY: A man needs to learn the art of relaxation. Life is a
SUDDENLY: precious commodity. Why waste it running headlong
SUDDENLY: into the future? Pause. Enjoy each moment as it passes.
SUDDENLY: Treadmills are for lab rats.
SUDDENLY: ERNIE'S VOICE
SUDDENLY: I don't sweat like this all the time. I was in Korea, we
SUDDENLY: were just a bunch of fresh-faced kids ...
SUDDENLY: Suddenly: a crackling BUZZ, static emanating from the wire. Ernie's sweat has caused a short.
SUDDENLY: Chaos follows, sounds of panic, footsteps shuffling, Ernie's muffled pleas.
SUDDENLY: #2.013
SUDDENLY: 31. CONTINUED:
SUDDENLY: They're in trouble.
SUDDENLY: Suddenly: the wire goes dead. Not a sound to be heard. Truman reaches for his headset, as if
SUDDENLY: to adjust. Hawk runs into view.
SUDDENLY: The wire's dead.
SUDDENLY: Cooper turns back to his binoculars, gazes at the farmhouse below.
SUDDENLY: Nothing at first. Perhaps some tumult glimpsed through a window. Then, suddenly, the front
SUDDENLY: door bursts open - it's Jean Renault, pushing Dennis Bryson into view, holding him tight,
SUDDENLY: pressing a gun into his ear. As hostage. Renault bellows:
SUDDENLY: COOPER!!!
SUDDENLY: FADE TO BLACK.
SUDDENLY: #2.013 Revised 11-8-90, PINK
SUDDENLY: 32. EXT. DEAD DOG FARM - DAY
SUDDENLY: Renault presses the gun hard against Bryson's ear. He yells a second time.
SUDDENLY: COOPER!!
SUDDENLY: Cooper and Truman exchange a look. A beat. And Cooper steps forward, out of hiding.
SUDDENLY: Coop!
SUDDENLY: He came for me, Harry.
SUDDENLY: Cooper steps from the bluff toward Jean Renault. Truman turns to Hawk.
SUDDENLY: Get Capability on the radio. I want backup.
SUDDENLY: State police?
SUDDENLY: The Bookhouse Boys.
SUDDENLY: Hawk races back to the cruiser. Below, Cooper nears the farmhouse and Renault.
SUDDENLY: I want safe passage to the border.
SUDDENLY: I'm not authorized to deal.
SUDDENLY: Then bring me someone who is.
SUDDENLY: First, release your hostages.
SUDDENLY: Why?
SUDDENLY: We will kill you if you don't.
SUDDENLY: Then everybody dies.
SUDDENLY: #2.013
SUDDENLY: 32. CONTINUED:
SUDDENLY: That is unacceptable.
SUDDENLY: We are at cross-purposes, Agent Cooper.
SUDDENLY: No. We will trade.
SUDDENLY: Trade?
SUDDENLY: Your hostages. Ernie Niles and Agent Bryson. For me.
SUDDENLY: Renault figures. It's what he wanted after all. Finally ... Renault smiles, nods assent.
SUDDENLY: Agreed.
SUDDENLY: Hands in the air, Agent Cooper. Come to me.
SUDDENLY: Cooper raises his hands, takes lonely steps toward Jean Renault, the farmhouse. Renault
SUDDENLY: releases Bryson. Shoves Ernie Niles after.
SUDDENLY: 33. INT. MARSH GARAGE APARTMENT - NIGHT
SUDDENLY: A dark bedroom. Moonlight pours through an open window, finds James sleeping. Evelyn
SUDDENLY: Marsh at his side. Evelyn slips quietly out of bed, naked, dresses in the shadows. CAMERA
SUDDENLY: FOLLOWS Evelyn as she exits from the bedroom, steps quietly down a flight of stairs.
SUDDENLY: CAMERA REVEALS Malcom standing below, waiting for her. Evelyn smiles sleepily
SUDDENLY: Malcom returns a grin.
SUDDENLY: How's our baby boy?
SUDDENLY: Sound asleep. Dreaming of love.
SUDDENLY: Lucky, lucky, lucky.
SUDDENLY: Malcom opens his arms. Evelyn eases into them. They exchange a deep and lasting kiss.
SUDDENLY: HOLD ON Malcom and Evelyn for a beat. Embracing in the dark.

SUDDENLY: 35. INT. DEAD DOG FARM - NIGHT
SUDDENLY: Cooper and Renault sit opposite each other inside. Renault keeps his pistol trained on Cooper.
SUDDENLY: Preston King paces about, nervous, he peers out a window.
SUDDENLY: More deputies. Sharpshooters. Let's deal. Or let's run.
SUDDENLY: King is starting to panic. But not Renault. He remains calm, quietly philosophical.
SUDDENLY: Will they let us run, Agent Cooper?
SUDDENLY: No.
SUDDENLY: Will they deal?
SUDDENLY: I doubt it.
SUDDENLY: What do you suggest we do?
SUDDENLY: Surrender.
SUDDENLY: I agree.
SUDDENLY: Are you crazy?
SUDDENLY: There is only one thing left to decide. To surrender
SUDDENLY: quietly. Or to kill you first.
SUDDENLY: Then you will die.

SUDDENLY: 35. CONTINUED:
SUDDENLY: I know.
SUDDENLY: Is my death so important?
SUDDENLY: My brothers are dead. I hold you responsible.
SUDDENLY: I met Bernard once. As for Jacques, I arrested him,
SUDDENLY: nothing more.
SUDDENLY: But I blame you, Agent Cooper.
SUDDENLY: Why?
SUDDENLY: Before you came here, Twin Peaks was a simple place.
SUDDENLY: My brothers sold drugs to truck-drivers and teenagers.
SUDDENLY: One-Eyed Jack's welcomed curious tourists and
SUDDENLY: businessmen. Quiet people lived quiet lives. Then a
SUDDENLY: pretty girl dies. And you arrive. Everything changes.
SUDDENLY: My brother Bernard is shot and left to die in the woods.
SUDDENLY: A grieving father smothers my surviving brother with a
SUDDENLY: pillow. Arson, kidnapping. More death and
SUDDENLY: destruction. Suddenly the quiet people here are no
SUDDENLY: longer quiet. Their simple dreams have become a
SUDDENLY: nightmare.
SUDDENLY: (shifts his grip on the pistol, as if he now meant
SUDDENLY: to shoot a hole in Cooper's chest)
SUDDENLY: What's one more death, after all? Maybe yours will be
SUDDENLY: the last. Maybe you brought the nightmare with you.
SUDDENLY: Renault is toying with Cooper, spinning words into ideas. But there is something eerily
SUDDENLY: accurate about his playful philosophizing. King is unimpressed.
SUDDENLY: I don't know what the hell you think you're talkin' about.
SUDDENLY: But I do know that we have a goddam problem and if
SUDDENLY: you don't want to solve it. I will -
SUDDENLY: (stops at the window, stares outside. Open-
SUDDENLY: mouthed)
SUDDENLY: Jean? You want to take a look at this?
SUDDENLY: Renault gets up, steps to the window. Keeping an eye on Cooper all the while. He joins King,
SUDDENLY: peers outside.

INTERCUT: 36. WHAT THEY SEE
INTERCUT: Improbably, impossibly, a WAITRESS from the Double R Diner sashays toward the
INTERCUT: farmhouse, holding a tray aloft into the night air. It's a surreal image, the waitress caught in
INTERCUT: the glaring jeep lights, stepping closer, steam rising off the food above her.
INTERCUT: 35. BACK TO SCENE
INTERCUT: You order food?
INTERCUT: King draws his gun as if to fire. But Renault stops him.
INTERCUT: Let her come.
INTERCUT: Cooper follows their exchange intently, looks toward the door. A beat. And someone knocks
INTERCUT: three times. Renault steps to open it. Standing in the doorway, tray held aloft, is Dennis - or
INTERCUT: rather Denise Bryson, in full Double R regalia.
INTERCUT: Suppertime.
INTERCUT: Several things happen simultaneously; Jean looks closer at the waitress, dimly recognizes the
INTERCUT: face. Denise lets the tray drop down to her waist, revealing a gun upon it. In one smooth
INTERCUT: motion she hurls the pistol toward Cooper, even as he leaps forward out of his chair. Jean turns
INTERCUT: to fire at Cooper. Denise drops Preston King with a right cross to the jaw.
INTERCUT: Cooper shoots Renault through the heart. Sheriff Truman and Deputy Hawk pour inside, guns
INTERCUT: ready. Both spot Renault dead on the floor. Denise cuffing Preston King. They lower their
INTERCUT: weapons. A beat, then:
INTERCUT: Quick thinking, Denise.
INTERCUT: Don't thank me. Thank Sheriff Truman. It was his idea.
INTERCUT: Cooper turns to Harry. Surprised, proud. He smiles.
INTERCUT: Harry S. Truman.

INTERCUT: Bobby!!
INTERCUT: Shelly whirls about, hysterical. That's when she SEES him. Leo Johnson standing across the

INTERCUT: bingo so it took a while to get everybody together.
INTERCUT: Then there was the bang I told you about. It sounded
INTERCUT: like it was right upstairs so we all got out of here.
INTERCUT: Well, it turned out to be the transformer on the pole
INTERCUT: right above and behind the building but we had to wait
INTERCUT: to go back inside because the transformer was shooting
INTERCUT: sparks everywhere and we were afraid it would start the
INTERCUT: station on fire, too. But it didn't.
INTERCUT: Do they know what started it, Lucy?
INTERCUT: "Suspicious in nature," that's what Chief Kipple said. He was suffering
INTERCUT: from smoke inhalation at the time so he sounded a little hoarse -

INTERCUT: Hawk standing by Harry's desk, eyes turned toward his chair. Truman shifts, aims the flashlight
INTERCUT: to follow their gaze ...
INTERCUT: ... and reveals a horrifying tableau. A DEAD MAN seated in the chair, eyes frozen wide in an
