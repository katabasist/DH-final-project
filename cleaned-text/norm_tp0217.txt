FADE OUT: 9. INT. BOOKHOUSE - DAY
FADE OUT: OPEN ON Truman, looking pretty much as before. His breakfast hasn't been touched. His
FADE OUT: whiskey has. He continues to fiddle with the empty shot glass. Cooper enters, taking in the
FADE OUT: whole scene with a glance; he sits down across from Truman.
FADE OUT: Coop.
FADE OUT: Harry.
FADE OUT: We got Josie's dossier in from INTERPOL.
FADE OUT: More good news.
FADE OUT: In addition to her killing Eckhardt, trying to kill me and
FADE OUT: killing Jonathan in Seattle...
FADE OUT: Closed cases.
FADE OUT: She's also been a wanted for a variety of felonies in Hong
FADE OUT: Kong.
FADE OUT: I don't need to hear this.
FADE OUT: She also had two prostitution arrests...
FADE OUT: Truman turns away in despair.
FADE OUT: Harry, eventually it'll help for you to know she was a
FADE OUT: hardened criminal. A killer.
FADE OUT: Get out.
FADE OUT: I know it's not easy now -
FADE OUT: #2.017
FADE OUT: 9. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: Go.
FADE OUT: Cooper stands, gives his friend a long look and walks slowly out of the Bookhouse.
FADE OUT: 10. INT. BLUE PINE LODGE
FADE OUT: CATHERINE sits at her desk, pores over blueprints and documents. Plans for the new and
FADE OUT: improved Ghostwood development. She hears a faint rustling sound, looks up ... and sees
FADE OUT: JONES standing across the room.
FADE OUT: The door was open.
FADE OUT: A country habit. We're all so trusting.
FADE OUT: My name is Jones, I was exec executive assistant to the late Mr.
FADE OUT: Eckhardt.
FADE OUT: Catherine gestures to a chair, carefully watches her guest take a seat. Jones has a satchel purse,
FADE OUT: which Catherine is also watching.
FADE OUT: Thank you. I've come to expedite the transport of his
FADE OUT: body back to Hong Kong.
FADE OUT: (Catherine says nothing: what does this woman
FADE OUT: want?)
FADE OUT: Tragic, what happened. You know, he really did love
FADE OUT: Josie.
FADE OUT: Didn't we all.
FADE OUT: They're going to be buried side by side...
FADE OUT: So they can keep an eye on each other.
FADE OUT: I guess you have your reasons to be bitter.
FADE OUT: #2.017
FADE OUT: 10. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: Call me a healthy skeptic.
FADE OUT: Catherine raises her hand above the desk, reveals the gun she's been holding since she discovered
FADE OUT: Jones in her living room.
FADE OUT: Now, what did you really come here to see me about?
FADE OUT: I came here to give you a gift.
FADE OUT: May I?
FADE OUT: I don't think so.
FADE OUT: Empty it.
FADE OUT: Jones complies, emptying her large purse onto the couch beside her. Out fall no guns or
FADE OUT: weapons of any kind, just women 's minutiae, save one very mysterious looking black box.
FADE OUT: Jones picks it up and hands it to Catherine.
FADE OUT: From Thomas.
FADE OUT: Catherine gazes at it, puzzled. Jones scoops her belongings back into the purse and rises to her
FADE OUT: feet, Catherine lowers the gun barrel.
FADE OUT: I have a few things to tidy up, then I'll be leaving tonight.
FADE OUT: Good luck, Mrs. Martell.
FADE OUT: We HEAR her going as the SHOT CLOSES on the black gift box.
FADE OUT: 11. INT. HAYWARD HOUSE
FADE OUT: Donna sits in the front room over a cup of coffee and a copy of the Gazette. The DOORBELL
FADE OUT: sounds. At the door is a vaguely familiar man with a close light beard, spectacles and thick,
FADE OUT: snowy eyebrows. We RECOGNIZE his face from the photograph in Earle's cabin.
FADE OUT: Excuse me. I'm looking for Bill or Eileen Hayward.
FADE OUT: They're not in. Can I help you?
FADE OUT: #2.017 13.
FADE OUT: 11. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: I'm Dr. Gerald Craig, a friend of Will's from medical
FADE OUT: school. I've got a convention over in Spokane, and I
FADE OUT: thought I'd swing by and surprise them. Now, which
FADE OUT: daughter are you?
FADE OUT: I'm Donna.
FADE OUT: Would you like to come in, Dr. Craig?
FADE OUT: I'd appreciate that.
FADE OUT: They enter the living room, toward the perpendicularity of couch and chair.
FADE OUT: Would you like some coffee?
FADE OUT: Thank you, no.
FADE OUT: Is this your local paper?
FADE OUT: Yes. It's a pretty small town.
FADE OUT: Craig is stealing a glance at her, and various details of the room.
FADE OUT: Don't knock small towns, till you've lived in a city
FADE OUT: Donna. Looks to me like Will's found himself a little
FADE OUT: piece of heaven here.
FADE OUT: Now, don't you have two sisters?
FADE OUT: Yes. They're younger.
FADE OUT: Are they both as beautiful as you?
FADE OUT: Well I don't really -
FADE OUT: Funny. Your dad and I used to sit around, try to figure
FADE OUT: how our lives would turn out. Think he came closer to the
FADE OUT: mark than I have.
FADE OUT: #2.017 14.
FADE OUT: 11. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: You're in high school?
FADE OUT: Unfortunately.
FADE OUT: I felt exactly the same way. High school's difficult; you
FADE OUT: have no idea what you want to do with your life, so it
FADE OUT: seems as if almost none of it applies to your life.
FADE OUT: That's right.
FADE OUT: Trust me, it'll make sense later. For now, just enjoy it.
FADE OUT: In all its absurdity.
FADE OUT: Donna is visibly refreshed to hear so something from an adult that sounds so life-accurate.
FADE OUT: I have a small gift for your dad. Can I trust you not to
FADE OUT: open it?
FADE OUT: Sure.
FADE OUT: Craig pulls a small, wrapped box from his pocket.
FADE OUT: Speaking of school. Will and I graduated thirty years
FADE OUT: ago, this month. This is a small remembrance for him.
FADE OUT: He hands it to her. With the box is a piece of paper.
FADE OUT: I should be on my way. That's the number where I'm
FADE OUT: staying.
FADE OUT: Hope to see you later, Donna.
FADE OUT: Me, too.
FADE OUT: She looks at this little package with fascination. As he ambles off, we HEAR Craig begin to
FADE OUT: whistle: we RECOGNIZE this as the piece Earle was playing on his Samurai flute.
FADE OUT: #2.017
FADE OUT: 12. INT. SHERIFF'S STATION - DAY
FADE OUT: Encamped in one growing corner of the room is PETE MARTELL, surrounded by chess
FADE OUT: boards, chess books, coffee, lined tablets on which he's made notations specific enough to
FADE OUT: embarrass some field generals of actual wars. Cooper enters.
FADE OUT: Pete, how are we doing?
FADE OUT: Martell looks up. Another face in need of sleep.
FADE OUT: Never had to look at a chess board like it's a bunch of
FADE OUT: actual human beings. Makes for some nasty dreams.
FADE OUT: I've been through every stalemate in recorded history, and
FADE OUT: I've jerryrigged a few country standoffs they've written no
FADE OUT: books about. But it's no use: there isn't a stalemate game
FADE OUT: on earth where you don't lose at least a few footsoldiers.
FADE OUT: The classic Herbstman leaves you with six pieces. Now I
FADE OUT: can improve on that, but even if I get there in half the
FADE OUT: time and keep twelve, that means six people will die.
FADE OUT: Do your best, Pete. Windom Earle's genius carries with it
FADE OUT: the vice of impatientence. He doesn't want to kill eight
FADE OUT: pawns. He wants royalty. Protect those, particularly the
FADE OUT: queen, and we can frustrate him.
FADE OUT: You can't do that.
FADE OUT: My students.
FADE OUT: In another corner of the room, LUCY and ANDY sit across a chess board, clearly at
FADE OUT: loggerheads.
FADE OUT: Mr. Martell, Andy moved his knight but he didn't do the
FADE OUT: little hook thing.
FADE OUT: You don't have to do the little hook thing. That's
FADE OUT: optional.
FADE OUT: Andy ... the knight has to do the little hook thing.
FADE OUT: #2.017
FADE OUT: 12. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: Every time?
FADE OUT: It's a privilege. No one else gets to make that move.
FADE OUT: Okay, Mr. Martell...
FADE OUT: Lucy looks on at her opponent with indignant superiority.
FADE OUT: I guess some people don't know quite as much as they
FADE OUT: think they do...
FADE OUT: Check.
FADE OUT: Brennan stares at the board. Cooper turns to see he has visitors.
FADE OUT: BRIGG'S VOICE
FADE OUT: We thought it best we come see you.
FADE OUT: 13. INT. CONFERENCE ROOM
FADE OUT: ANGLE ON the blackboard, on which are drawn three inverted triangles. PULL BACK to
FADE OUT: Cooper, Briggs and the Log Lady.
FADE OUT: As you know, that pattern on the back of my neck
FADE OUT: appeared during ... my experience. With of course no
FADE OUT: idea as to how it got there.
FADE OUT: And you noticed it today.
FADE OUT: My log noticed. I remember.
FADE OUT: Remember?
FADE OUT: Look at the back of my leg.
FADE OUT: 14. INSERT - HER LEG
FADE OUT: Behind the knee is the figure of a square with an 'x' inside, creating four triangles.
FADE OUT: #2.017
FADE OUT: 14. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: Where Cooper has drawn this image on the board, beside the inverted triangles of Briggs:
FADE OUT: I was seven years old. I went walking up in the woods
FADE OUT: and when I got back, I was told I'd disappeared for a
FADE OUT: day. All I could recall was a flash of light ... and that
FADE OUT: mark was on my leg.
FADE OUT: We all three recall the light.
FADE OUT: And also... the sound of an owl...
FADE OUT: I remember that.
FADE OUT: The only other other time I saw that sight and heard that
FADE OUT: sound... was just before my husband died.
FADE OUT: Cooper is staring at the board. He steps up to the square of four triangles and draws Briggs's
FADE OUT: three smaller inverted triangles inside them creating another shape which immediately
FADE OUT: excites Briggs and the Log Lady.
FADE OUT: I've seen that before.
FADE OUT: Yes...
FADE OUT: Cooper turns to them excitedly.
FADE OUT: What is it?
FADE OUT: Something about this figure is visibly upsetting to them both. Briggs looks at Cooper and just
FADE OUT: shakes his head. The Log Lady hunkers down with her log, for security and insight, and finally
FADE OUT: looks up, dismayed.
FADE OUT: I don't know...
FADE OUT: CLOSE ON the blackboard's symbol.

FADE OUT: 15. EXT. WOODS - DAY
FADE OUT: OPEN ON a wooded vista, some hidden spot in the verdent forest. We HEAR a man's voice,
FADE OUT: singing clear as a bell, 0 Bury Me Not On The Lone Prairie. CAMERA MOVES between the
FADE OUT: pines to REVEAL Audrey and John Wheeler seated upon a blanket, a picnic lunch between
FADE OUT: them, Wheeler singing his cowboy song. Audrey watches, jawdropped, she couldn't be more
FADE OUT: surprised ... or taken with this handsome stranger. Wheeler finishes, peers at her. For once in her
FADE OUT: life Audrey Horne is speechless. Finally:
FADE OUT: Wow.
FADE OUT: Wheeler says nothing, waits for her. Audrey, suddenly vulnerable, without the usual banter to
FADE OUT: protect her, finally continues:
FADE OUT: Nobody's ever sung a song to me before.
FADE OUT: You must've been serenaded a time or two.
FADE OUT: I don't inspire a lot of singing. Most boys are afraid.
FADE OUT: Wolf whistles, maybe.
FADE OUT: They don't know you then. Not really.
FADE OUT: He's right. Audrey's been waiting a long time for someone to discover her secrets. She's
FADE OUT: delighted, though not sure what to say. Wheeler interprets her silence as rebuke.
FADE OUT: Sorry for being forward. It's not I like I know you that
FADE OUT: well. In fact I don't know you at all.
FADE OUT: Charm is a rocky road...
FADE OUT: Another cowboy song, I know, a shot...?
FADE OUT: I'm completely tone deaf.
FADE OUT: Now it's his turn to be discomfited. A beat. Both realizing that the other fills them with a
FADE OUT: sort of uncertain warmth, the awkwardness that accompanies sudden infatuation, or love.
FADE OUT: Wheeler reaches for a bottle of beer, changes the subject.
FADE OUT: Flying out here, I took a big northern swing. It's
FADE OUT: beautiful. The air and light up toward the pole is like
FADE OUT: Revised 1-10-91, Green
FADE OUT: #2.017 19.
FADE OUT: 15. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: nothing you've ever seen. You sort of float while the earth
FADE OUT: turns underneath. And the northern light gets trapped on
FADE OUT: the horizon, in this bright blue band. Frozen light.
FADE OUT: Frozen color.
FADE OUT: Wheeler looks at her. Audrey pauses, preoccupied; then returns to the heart of the matter.
FADE OUT: I don't think anyone really knows me.
FADE OUT: That sounds like a warning.
FADE OUT: I know.
FADE OUT: Audrey. If there's some other guy, I'll...
FADE OUT: There used to be, but...
FADE OUT: A long beat. Audrey thinking about Cooper, first love, then, at last...
FADE OUT: No. There's not. There's nobody.
FADE OUT: So what'll we do now?
FADE OUT: Know any more cowboy tricks?
FADE OUT: If you've got a lariat in that picnic basket, I could lasso
FADE OUT: passing cattle.
FADE OUT: The closest cow is miles from here.
FADE OUT: Well. Stray dogs, raccoons, a bluebird ... anything you
FADE OUT: want...
FADE OUT: HOLD ON Jack and Audrey for a beat. Falling in love. FADE OUT.

FADE OUT: 16. INT. HAYWARD'S LIVING ROOM. - DAY
FADE OUT: DOC and EILEEN HAYWARD enter, Doc pushing her in the wheelchair. Donna enters from
FADE OUT: a back room.
FADE OUT: You two had a visitor.
FADE OUT: Who's that?
FADE OUT: Somebody you went to medical school with. Gerald
FADE OUT: Craig?
FADE OUT: Hayward reacts with visible surprise. Eileen pales.
FADE OUT: Gerald Craig? That's impossible, Donna.
FADE OUT: He's on his way to convention in Spokane. He knew all
FADE OUT: about me and...
FADE OUT: He left a phone number. And this.
FADE OUT: Donna hands her father the wrapped package , Craig's phone number. Hayward, still silent,
FADE OUT: stunned, hands the number to Eileen, begins to open the package
FADE OUT: Gerry Craig was my roommate, he ... he drowned during a
FADE OUT: rafting trip on the Snake River. I was there, Donna, I
FADE OUT: tried to save him, but...
FADE OUT: Then who was ...?
FADE OUT: Eileen turns to both from the phone, she's just dialed the number Donna gave them.
FADE OUT: It's a cemetary.
FADE OUT: Doc takes the lid off the gift box.
FADE OUT: 17. INSERT - THE OPENED BOX
FADE OUT: contains a beautiful black hand-carved chess piece. A knight. The piece of paper below it
FADE OUT: Revised 1-11-91, YELLOW
FADE OUT: #2.017 21.
FADE OUT: 17. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: reads "Kn to KB3".
FADE OUT: Knight to King's Bishop 3.
FADE OUT: What is it, dad?
FADE OUT: That man, he's ... he's very dangerous. Don't let him in
FADE OUT: here again, do you understand?
FADE OUT: Sure -
FADE OUT: I've got to take this over to Cooper.
FADE OUT: He gathers up the box, chess piece and paper, then exits.
FADE OUT: Donna give me your father's yearbook. It's upstairs, in the
FADE OUT: study ...
FADE OUT: Donna nods assent. WE FOLLOW her out of the room and up the stairs. From far away, WE
FADE OUT: HEAR the DOORBELL.
FADE OUT: I'll get it
FADE OUT: Fearing this might again be the impostor, Donna starts down the stairs, but only gets a couple
FADE OUT: beats down...
FADE OUT: 18. DONNA'S POV
FADE OUT: looking down over the stairway, into the front alcove. Eileen leans forward in her wheelchair
FADE OUT: to unlock the door. A MAN immediately steps inside. It is Ben Horne. He drops to one
FADE OUT: knee and speaks to Eileen in urgent, hushed tones. We cannot HEAR what is being said.
FADE OUT: 19. INT. HURLEY LIVING ROOM DAY
FADE OUT: Ed and NADINE sit body-width apart on the couch. DR. LAWRENCE JACOBY sits in a
FADE OUT: facing chair.

FADE OUT: 19. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: Nadine, what I'm really here to say to you is...
FADE OUT: (a look to Jacoby, who gazes back with cool
FADE OUT: encouragement)
FADE OUT: ... seeing as how you're with Mike now...
FADE OUT: It's so cute the way you get embarrassed.
FADE OUT: Ed gathers himself. This is not easy. Despite the absurdity of it, this is still, after all, his
FADE OUT: wife; and someone he's been with since high school.
FADE OUT: And since I've found someone else ... Nadine, I'm not sure
FADE OUT: you're going to understand this.
FADE OUT: Course I understand, Eddie. This isn't just a little spat.
FADE OUT: Do you know what Ed is suggesting?
FADE OUT: It's not too obvious. We're not like talking relativity
FADE OUT: here. We're breaking up. Major, final breakup.
FADE OUT: Ed and Jacoby trade looks.
FADE OUT: Well, yes, technically it is a breakup, Nadine...
FADE OUT: But it's a little more than that, too, honey.
FADE OUT: Ed, you're so serious. These are the dating years. You're
FADE OUT: acting like it's some really big deal.
FADE OUT: Doc ...
FADE OUT: There aren't any secret tricks or magic words. It's like
FADE OUT: the dissolving of scar tissue around a wound: she'll start
FADE OUT: to see reality again when her mind begins to feel safe.
FADE OUT: When will that be?

FADE OUT: Can't say. That tissue's packed in there pretty hard.
FADE OUT: Okay, well one thing I don't want to see, Ed, are any
FADE OUT: incidents with Mike. No jealous rages.
FADE OUT: Well... maybe just a little one.
FADE OUT: I give up.
FADE OUT: Nadine. You and Ed are about to get a divorce.
FADE OUT: Nadine stares at Jacoby. Her expression goes from incomprehension to discomfort to fear.
FADE OUT: Suddenly she closes her good right eye. Opens it.
FADE OUT: I think I've gone blind in my left eye.
FADE OUT: It's the eye with the patch. Ed and Jacoby again trade looks, they are both bankrupt of
FADE OUT: responses.
FADE OUT: 20. INT. DINER
FADE OUT: OPEN ON Norma looking at a FLYER for the Miss Twin Peaks contest. She then carries it
FADE OUT: over to Shelly at the counter.
FADE OUT: Shelly, have you seen this?
FADE OUT: "Miss Twin Peaks."
FADE OUT: Me? Are you kidding?
FADE OUT: There's a cash prize, a college scholarship ... I'll bet you
FADE OUT: could walk away with it.
FADE OUT: I don't know, Norma.
FADE OUT: It's easy. Give a speech, answer a couple questions...
FADE OUT: Miss Double R Diner, how would you bring about world

FADE OUT: peace?
FADE OUT: Well. I would ask all world's leaders to form a circle
FADE OUT: and hold hands. Because you can't make a fist if you're
FADE OUT: busy holding hands.
FADE OUT: You're a shoe-in.
FADE OUT: I've got an order up.
FADE OUT: Shelly, to Norma's amusement, sashays to the kitchen window and vamps the order over to her
FADE OUT: customer, a dark-haired man who looks like a highway gypsy, possibly a trucker.
FADE OUT: What's with the little dance?
FADE OUT: Oh, my boss was telling me I should enter this contest.
FADE OUT: Miss Twin Peaks.
FADE OUT: As she lowers his order, we see the EMERALD RING of Windom Earle.
FADE OUT: You can kid about it, but you're very pretty. I think you
FADE OUT: should enter.
FADE OUT: Thank you. I never think of myself as pretty.
FADE OUT: Shelly muses as she walks away. Over her shoulder we watch Cooper enter and take a counter
FADE OUT: seat on the side opposite Earle, and further down. We CLOSE ON Cooper.
FADE OUT: Are you ready to order?
FADE OUT: He looks up at this unfamiliar voice and freezes on Annie Blackburne's face. There is instant,
FADE OUT: mutual attraction. Something close to love at first sight. Cooper is hooked by Annie's soft
FADE OUT: features - Botticcelli's Venus serving coffee. Annie feels it too, but is far less comfortable with
FADE OUT: it.
FADE OUT: A cup of deep, black joe.
FADE OUT: Coming right up.

FADE OUT: 20. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: You're a new face.
FADE OUT: I'm Annie. Norma's sister.
FADE OUT: Dale Cooper. Local law enforcement.
FADE OUT: Must keep you pretty busy
FADE OUT: It does. But in this town, there's always time to sit a
FADE OUT: while and absorb ... observe.
FADE OUT: Are you staying in town ... awhile?
FADE OUT: I might be here quite a while
FADE OUT: It's happened to me.
FADE OUT: Looks like it's grown on you.
FADE OUT: Things have a way of doing that here.
FADE OUT: She starts to speak, then self-consciously backs off, sloe-eyed, half-smiling.
FADE OUT: 21. POV - THE MAN
FADE OUT: stares over at Cooper speaking to Annie. Studying him.
FADE OUT: As Annie serves his coffee, her longsleeved shirt rides up far enough for Cooper to spot the
FADE OUT: beginning of extensive wrist scars. He knows what they mean.
FADE OUT: I made it a little strong.
FADE OUT: You made it right.
FADE OUT: Cooper gets an odd feeling, and suddenly looks across the counter: Earle is gone. Hawk

FADE OUT: 22. INT. BOOKHOUSE ENTRANCE - NIGHT
FADE OUT: Dark, ominous. Standing beside the door is Andy.
FADE OUT: Agent Cooper, Hawk, the Sheriff's gone off. He's broken
FADE OUT: every piece of furniture that's not nailed down and shot
FADE OUT: out the ceiling lights. I honestly don't know what to do.
FADE OUT: It's okay, Andy.
FADE OUT: He is clearly frightened. Cooper and Hawk follow a trail of broken furniture. Truman sits in
FADE OUT: darkness, a bottle of Jack Daniels beside him, gun in hand.
FADE OUT: Hello, Coop. How's business?
FADE OUT: A little complicated at the moment.
FADE OUT: Nice thing about the law. It doesn't breathe.
FADE OUT: You can't kill it.
FADE OUT: Harry, let's make this simple ... why don't you hand me
FADE OUT: that gun.
FADE OUT: Don't think I've handed my gun over to anybody my
FADE OUT: entire life.
FADE OUT: This might be the time.
FADE OUT: You know something else I've never done? I've never
FADE OUT: really left Twin Peaks. Ever. Never crossed the ocean. I
FADE OUT: was the one who stayed. Then Josie came to town. And
FADE OUT: my life...
FADE OUT: My life was different. It was better. And now she's

FADE OUT: Your life belongs to you, Harry. Josie didn't take it with
FADE OUT: her.
FADE OUT: When I walked in that room... and it looked like I might
FADE OUT: have to shoot her...
FADE OUT: I know she lied. I know she was evil.
FADE OUT: I looked into her eyes... and watched the life drain out of
FADE OUT: them... she was...
FADE OUT: ... so helpless... she needed me and there was nothing I
FADE OUT: could do...
FADE OUT: With that, Truman completely unravels, knocking over the bottle.
FADE OUT: It didn't have to end like that... she didn't have to die...
FADE OUT: The gun's aim swings into wider, more dangerous circles. Cooper steps in, pulls Truman into
FADE OUT: a bearhug. Truman grabs onto him, finally allowing himself some comfort.
FADE OUT: Easy.
FADE OUT: The sheriff's arms extend despondently, the gun dangling from his hand. Hawk takes it.
FADE OUT: There's so much I don't understand...
FADE OUT: We're all like that, Harry.

FADE OUT: Cooper and Hawk carry Truman in, dropping him lightly down on the bed. They step over
FADE OUT: toward the table lamp, as Truman lies in the darker background.
FADE OUT: Somebody keep an eye on him tonight.
FADE OUT: Never seen him that way. It was like hiking out to a
FADE OUT: favorite spot and finding a hole where the lake used to be.
FADE OUT: Josie had power.
FADE OUT: "A man who doesn't love easily, loves too much."
FADE OUT: A good man.

FADE OUT: Okay, so we'll just go now. Me and Mrs. Hinkman.
FADE OUT: Two of the Ghostwood benefit models pass by. Young girls, about high school age. One of
FADE OUT: them slows at the sight of the registering couple.
FADE OUT: Is that ... Mike?
FADE OUT: Mike cringes. Nadine, through shades and an eye patch, stares knives at this girl, who is
FADE OUT: thinking her buddy Mike must have lost a bet.
FADE OUT: How are you, Susan?
FADE OUT: Fine.
FADE OUT: See you in school...
FADE OUT: Lazare looks askance at this. Nadine simmers. Mike feels her iron grip tighten further.
FADE OUT: The room, please.
FADE OUT: For emphasis, Nadine impatiently SLAMS the desk bell. The clerk stares down at the

FADE OUT: The Stop Ghostwood benefit has drawn a large, black tie crowd. BEN HORNE stands at the
FADE OUT: microphone, located off on a wing of the newly constructed runway.
FADE OUT: I'd first like to thank you all for this marvelous turnout.
FADE OUT: It's gratifying to see so many people who are serious
FADE OUT: about their environment.
FADE OUT: The Stop Ghostwood campaign is a determined effort to
FADE OUT: keep the rabid development interests from trying to turn
FADE OUT: our beautiful northwest forests into a monstrous
FADE OUT: amusement park, destroying animal preserves that have
FADE OUT: been undisturbed for centuries, the little worlds which
FADE OUT: serve as sanctums for several endangered species.
FADE OUT: Before moving along, I'd just like to remind us all that
FADE OUT: ecology is not a luxury science, and it's not about pleasant
FADE OUT: appearances: it's about survival. About whether we're all
FADE OUT: going to make it. Period.
FADE OUT: But on the other hand, not to understate the value of visual
FADE OUT: splendor, we come now to our fashion show. If you think
FADE OUT: you recognize some of our models, it's because they're
FADE OUT: concerned members of our community who have
FADE OUT: graciously contributed their time tonight. So, ladies and
FADE OUT: gentlemen, to kick things off, our host Richard
FADE OUT: Tremayne.
FADE OUT: Tremayne approaches the mike to scattered applause, grinning up past his eyebrows.
FADE OUT: Thank you. Splendid gathering.
FADE OUT: We DROP to a LONG SHOT of the runway, FAVORING the models as they emerge. The
FADE OUT: first striding figure is Lucy Moran, cautiously eying Tremayne as she walks uncertainly out
FADE OUT: along the ramp.
FADE OUT: Our little Lucy wears a delightful mix of warm northern
FADE OUT: comfort and southern insouciance. An elegant worsted
FADE OUT: wool jacket over a sueded charmeuse T-shirt... fabulous,
FADE OUT: isn't it?
FADE OUT: Having nervously reached the end of the runway a little early, Lucy has to do a few too many
FADE OUT: turns and starts to grow dizzy.
FADE OUT: And a moonless-night-blue slim skirt of matching
FADE OUT: worsted, for the look that always says, hey, world! I'm
FADE OUT: here...
FADE OUT: #2.017 31.
FADE OUT: 25. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: Lucy wobbles back toward the curtain. A pause. The next model, who looks more like he's
FADE OUT: walking a plank than a runway, is Andy Brennan.
FADE OUT: Mr. Brennan, a man for all seasons, is wearing a baby rib
FADE OUT: wool turtleneck beneath a daring plaid all-wool
FADE OUT: pendleton shirt.
FADE OUT: Andy reaches the end of the ramp and freezes in stage fright, gawking out at the audience.
FADE OUT: The look is completed by his black flaring cotton
FADE OUT: trousers. For the man who wants to make a statement
FADE OUT: while retaining the casual feel, whether he's out mastering
FADE OUT: a task or riding the breeze of a chance meeting ...
FADE OUT: That'll do it, Andy.
FADE OUT: With stiff hulklike movements, Andy turns and goes.
FADE OUT: 26. BACKSTAGE
FADE OUT: Audrey hectically lines up the remaining models.
FADE OUT: At this rate, were going to run late, so if you could all
FADE OUT: sort of hurry Richard along with some quick movement
FADE OUT: our there ...
FADE OUT: Lucy walks past, still a little dazed, trailing Andy, the bright red turtleneck almost exploding
FADE OUT: out of his shirt.
FADE OUT: I'm hot in this thing.
FADE OUT: You're hot? All this worsted? I'm dressed like a sheep.
FADE OUT: And I also think Mr. Tremayne's getting a little warm
FADE OUT: himself, over all these girls...
FADE OUT: Our next model....
FADE OUT: Audrey gives the lead girl a tap.
FADE OUT: Go!
FADE OUT: #2.017
FADE OUT: 27. THE BAR
FADE OUT: Ben Horne sits over a drink, momentarily escaping the crowd. Catherine sits beside him.
FADE OUT: Well, if it isn't John Muir, friend of the redwood.
FADE OUT: Catherine, dear, how good of you to come?
FADE OUT: Ben, darling, let me ask you; who are you kidding with all this?
FADE OUT: Catherine, I am absolutely one hundred per cent sincere.
FADE OUT: Ben, look who you're talking to. We're in the same line of
FADE OUT: work: you've always been a little more obvious, but this...
FADE OUT: at least I use some imagination.
FADE OUT: Catherine, have you ever in your entire life had an
FADE OUT: experience that truly changed you.
FADE OUT: Spare me the Born Again sales pitch and level with me,
FADE OUT: you can't really hope to stop development plans with
FADE OUT: this little sideshow; what do you actually expect to gain
FADE OUT: from all this?
FADE OUT: A first scrubbing on one of the dirtiest consciences in the
FADE OUT: entire Northwest.
FADE OUT: It'll happen to you, Catherine. I know what you're
FADE OUT: planning with Ghostwood. And granted, I used to see
FADE OUT: life exactly the way you do. And no matter how many
FADE OUT: deals I closed, or much money I made, inside I was a
FADE OUT: black, miserable clod of dirt. Catherine, the one thing
FADE OUT: that really affords you joy in life, the only authentic
FADE OUT: thing is giving. Darling, don't wait until you're on your
FADE OUT: death bed to find that out.
FADE OUT: God help you. It sounds like you actually mean this.
FADE OUT: I do mean it. For you, for me, and for the future.
FADE OUT: #2.017
FADE OUT: 27. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: Catherine, why not take this opportunity to transcend a
FADE OUT: lifetime of megalomania and egocentricity...
FADE OUT: ... and write us a fat check to help stop Ghostwood?
FADE OUT: 28. RUNWAY STAGE
FADE OUT: Standing beside Tremayne, much to Richard's disgust, is Tim Pinkle, attired in a cherry
FADE OUT: sportcoat and pink polyester pants. Beside Pinkle is a cage, containing a meek-looking weasel.
FADE OUT: And now, to introduce us to an endangered little critter
FADE OUT: whose home is currently under attack by the proposed
FADE OUT: Ghostwooddevelopment project ... Mr. Tim Pinkle.
FADE OUT: Thanks, Dick. How's everybody doing tonight?
FADE OUT: That's good.
FADE OUT: In following the taller Tremayne, Pinkle loosens the stand in order to lower the mike, which
FADE OUT: drops with a loud thud down to his ankle. In trying to extend it back up, he encounters more
FADE OUT: resistance, gives it a good yank and shoots the mike up for someone six-eleven. Tremayne just
FADE OUT: stares at him. Finally Pinkle lowers it to where it was originally.
FADE OUT: Thank you. I'm here to introduce you all to a little guy
FADE OUT: who doesn't understand the dark peril that awaits him.
FADE OUT: An innocent in a world gone mad ...
FADE OUT: Tremayne lightly elbows him, in a plea for brevity. Pinkie drops down and opens the cage.
FADE OUT: Ladies and gentlemen, I give you ... the endangered Pine
FADE OUT: Weasel.
FADE OUT: Pinkle reaches down into the cage and pulls up the frightened animal, who is half-hypnotized
FADE OUT: by the lights.
FADE OUT: This species, technically of the weasel family, not only is
FADE OUT: nonaggressive toward us humans and has beautiful fur ... he
FADE OUT: is also by nature an excellent controller of rodents.
FADE OUT: Pinkle holds the animal up in front of Tremayne.
FADE OUT: #2.017
FADE OUT: 28. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: Unfortunately the little fella is a very curious animal,
FADE OUT: making him unusually easy to trap. He's particularly
FADE OUT: drawn to ...
FADE OUT: The weasel leans over toward Tremayne, sniffing.
FADE OUT: ... bright tinkling objects.
FADE OUT: Must be my tie clasp.
FADE OUT: And to various smells, particularly, believe it or not, very
FADE OUT: cheap cologne ...
FADE OUT: Ignoring this, Tremayne affectionately drops his head down toward the weasel, playing to the
FADE OUT: audience. The little creature reaches up toward Tremayne.
FADE OUT: Think he wants to give you a little kiss, Dick ...
FADE OUT: Hello there, little pilgrim.
FADE OUT: The weasel lunges up sweetly and suddenly bites Tremayne on the nose. The host lets out a
FADE OUT: yell, trying to pull himself away, but the animal won't let go. Tremayne finally wrenches
FADE OUT: himself free, dancing up the runway in pain. The weasel screeches and bolts off the stage,
FADE OUT: causing an immediate panic in the crowd. Women scurry around senselessly, screaming in fear.
FADE OUT: No need to panic, folks ... he's completely harmless...
FADE OUT: The place is in chaos. The weasel tears through the room, under a banquet table, spilling back
FADE OUT: guests on both sides. Andy Brennan, still in costume, begins pursuit.
FADE OUT: Nobody panic!!......
FADE OUT: Up on the stage, Audrey is out trying to restore order.
FADE OUT: Please everyone, calm down... stay in your seats ...
FADE OUT: From behind, an alarmed model knocks Audrey off the runway. She tumbles headlong ... into
FADE OUT: the arms of Jack Justice Wheeler. And stays there.
FADE OUT: #2.017
FADE OUT: 28. CONTINUED:
FADE OUT: You alright?
FADE OUT: Fine ...
FADE OUT: Lot of fuss over a loose weasel.
FADE OUT: Maybe we should help.
FADE OUT: Oh, I don't know. Little excitement might do this crowd
FADE OUT: some good.
FADE OUT: They share a laugh as confused patrons knife by them. Audrey settles a little deeper into his
FADE OUT: arms.
FADE OUT: Did you come for the fashion show?
FADE OUT: No. I came for you.
FADE OUT: And with that, as the world falls apart all around them, Audrey and Wheeler share their first
FADE OUT: passionate kiss. HOLD ON this tableau for a beat.
FADE OUT: 29. OMITTED
FADE OUT: 30. OMITTED
FADE OUT: 31. INT. BOOKHOUSE
FADE OUT: ANGLE ON a Bookhouse Boy, CAPPY, who sits guarding the door. Suddenly a GUN
FADE OUT: BUTT cracks his head; he slides down onto the floor. The person who hit him, still faceless,
FADE OUT: moves further inside.
FADE OUT: 32. TRUMAN
FADE OUT: is asleep in bed. The assailant walks up to him, holding the gun. A beat. The gun is then
FADE OUT: placed on the nightstand.
FADE OUT: The CAMERA PANS UP until we see it is Jones, still looking down at the sleeping Truman.
FADE OUT: She now begins removing her clothes.
FADE OUT: FADE TO BLACK.
FADE OUT: THE END
