REVISED: 1. INT. HAROLD SMITH'S HOUSE - NIGHT
SUDDENLY: HAROLD SMITH looms, gardening tool in hand. It arcs through the air,
SUDDENLY: smashes Laura's diary out of MADDY FERGUSON'S hands. Maddy screams, backs toward
SUDDENLY: the door. But DONNA HAYWARD remains frozen in place, ashen, as Smith turns to her.
SUDDENLY: He speaks quietly at first, almost puzzled. And quite mad.
SUDDENLY: I trusted you. I invested my heart and my soul in you.
SUDDENLY: We only wanted to read it, I didn't -
SUDDENLY: Donna, run!
SUDDENLY: I thought you were different. You made me feel I could
SUDDENLY: return to the world and find something decent and pure.
SUDDENLY: But you're just like all the others. You lie, you betray, and
SUDDENLY: then you laugh about it. You are unclean. You have
SUDDENLY: contaminated me.
SUDDENLY: Smith raises the tool over his head. Donna remains transfixed. Maddy screams.
SUDDENLY: DONNA!!
SUDDENLY: Just then: the front door explodes open, JAMES HURLEY tumbles inside. The sound
SUDDENLY: distracts Smith, Donna regains her senses, turns to run. But then she spots Laura's diary open
SUDDENLY: on the floor nearby. Donna moves toward it, as if to grab and flee. Smith yells:
SUDDENLY: NO!
SUDDENLY: Donna!
SUDDENLY: James rushes forward, Smith raises his hand to strike. Donna retreats, James pushes Smith
SUDDENLY: out of the way, takes Donna by the hand. Maddy joins them as they rush our the door. Smith
SUDDENLY: kneels to retrieve the diary. He looks at the open door, the black night beyond it. The world
SUDDENLY: outside. Smith turns and races back to his greenhouse.
SUDDENLY: CAMERA VIEWS Smith through the large glass panel, his features lurch into view, shadowy,
SUDDENLY: distorted by the glass. He lets out a howl, but we can't quite hear it behind the thick panes.
SUDDENLY: #2.006
SUDDENLY: 1. CONTINUED:
SUDDENLY: Muffled, anguished. It sounds a little like "Laura."
SUDDENLY: 2. EXT. HAROLD SMITH'S HOUSE - NIGHT
SUDDENLY: James, Donna, and Maddy race into the night.
SUDDENLY: Run!!
SUDDENLY: He's not coming. He won't. He's afraid.
SUDDENLY: They stop running, catch breath.
SUDDENLY: Are you okay? Did he hurt you?
SUDDENLY: No. I'm fine. I ...
SUDDENLY: Donna begins to cry. James takes her into his arms. Donna holds him tighter.
SUDDENLY: Oh James. It's all my fault. I'm so sorry.
SUDDENLY: Don't cry. It's my fault too.
SUDDENLY: We have to tell the Sheriff. We'll tell him everything.
SUDDENLY: You've had enough trouble. I'll go.
SUDDENLY: But -
SUDDENLY: Just hold me. Please.
SUDDENLY: James takes Donna into a deeper embrace. Maddy stands and watches. Then looks away.

SUDDENLY: 4. INT. THE BOOKHOUSE - NIGHT
SUDDENLY: AGENT COOPER carries AUDREY HORNE into the Bookhouse interior. She moans
SUDDENLY: softly, drifting in and out. DEPUTY HAWK enters behind him. They are met by, a
SUDDENLY: handsome young man. A Bookhouse Boy named CAPPY.
SUDDENLY: We're all set up inside.
SUDDENLY: Cooper nods, no time for conversation. He carries Audrey to a bed inside a curtained area.
SUDDENLY: Cappy pulls back a blue blanket, assists Cooper as he gently sets Audrey upon it. They work
SUDDENLY: with quiet, but discernible urgency.
SUDDENLY: Cooper checks Audrey's pulse, softly placing two fingers upon her neck. He peers into her
SUDDENLY: eyes, listens to whispered breath.
SUDDENLY: Sluggish pulse. Pupils constricted. Breathing slow and shallow.
SUDDENLY: Cooper gently lifts her left arm - every time he touches her it is with great care and precision
SUDDENLY: and checks inside the elbow. Bruises. Red pinpricks.
SUDDENLY: Needle tracks. Most likely heroin.
SUDDENLY: Poor kid.
SUDDENLY: Daddy? ... Can you see me Daddy?
SUDDENLY: Multiple injections over the course of a two day period.
SUDDENLY: Audrey, can you hear me?
SUDDENLY: Audrey says nothing. Her eyes roll back. She nearly loses consciousness. Cooper leans closer.
SUDDENLY: Audrey, you must stay awake. Do you hear me? You've
SUDDENLY: got to stay awake.
SUDDENLY: Can you catch me? ... Can you ...?
SUDDENLY: Cooper watches, helpless, uncertain. Then, urgent, emphatic:
SUDDENLY: I want you to talk to me. Audrey, Please.
SUDDENLY: #2.006
SUDDENLY: 4. CONTINUED:
SUDDENLY: There's a faint note of desperation in his voice. But Audrey cannot hear it. She's lost in a
SUDDENLY: heroin fog, she rambles, slips in and out.
SUDDENLY: His tongue, so heavy ... a hand in my throat ... it hurts me,
SUDDENLY: Oh God it hurts ...
SUDDENLY: Black cold, the lake, black cold ... can't breathe ... help
SUDDENLY: me, please help me ... I'm sinking ...
SUDDENLY: Cooper gently gathers Audrey into his arms.
SUDDENLY: I'm here, Audrey. I will stay with you. You're right here.
SUDDENLY: You're right here with me.
SUDDENLY: Cooper gently places a hand upon her cheek, offers a healing caress. Suddenly: Audrey's
SUDDENLY: hand rises into view, takes Cooper by the palm. Holds on tight.
SUDDENLY: Audrey?
SUDDENLY: Audrey's eyes focus. She sees him for the first time.
SUDDENLY: I prayed prayed that you would come and you did ...
SUDDENLY: He holds her.
SUDDENLY: 5. EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT
SUDDENLY: Maddy drives off in the station wagon. James and Donna stand together, face to face.
SUDDENLY: She was so brave. I feel terrible. If anything had
SUDDENLY: happened to her
SUDDENLY: No more plans, okay? No more going off on our own.
SUDDENLY: James, he has Laura's secret diary. He could have killed
SUDDENLY: her.
SUDDENLY: He could've killed you too.
SUDDENLY: Revised 9-17-90. GREEN
SUDDENLY: #2.006
SUDDENLY: 5. CONTINUED:
SUDDENLY: Donna offers a gentle kiss, looks deep into James' eyes. A beat, then:
SUDDENLY: I feel stupid. Ashamed.
SUDDENLY: After Laura died, everything happened so fast. It's hard
SUDDENLY: to know exactly what to believe in.
SUDDENLY: Yes.
SUDDENLY: Bur when I saw you tonight I knew exactly what I
SUDDENLY: believed.
SUDDENLY: Did you?
SUDDENLY: It's like if we could put our hearts together, and keep
SUDDENLY: them that way forever, we'd be safe no matter what.
SUDDENLY: You and me.
SUDDENLY: From now on.
SUDDENLY: Yes.
SUDDENLY: James kisses her on the mouth. Donna reacts with whispered repetition.
SUDDENLY: Yes.
SUDDENLY: They kiss with even greater fervor. Their passion in direct contrast to - or perhaps in
SUDDENLY: conjunction with - their innocence.

SUDDENLY: 7. INT. TRUMAN'S OFFICE - NIGHT
SUDDENLY: Sheriff Truman looks up from a book of mug shots and corresponding paper work as
SUDDENLY: Cooper enters and slumps, exhausted, into a chair across from him.
SUDDENLY: How is she?
SUDDENLY: She's through the worst of it. Heroin.
SUDDENLY: This close to a lethal dose. Sooner or later the dope
SUDDENLY: would have been lethal. Hard to imagine that kind of
SUDDENLY: cruelty.
SUDDENLY: Truman slides the mug book over to Cooper. Points out a shot.
SUDDENLY: Not really. Take a look. Blackie's killer. I knew I'd
SUDDENLY: seen him before. Jean Renault.
SUDDENLY: "Renault?"
SUDDENLY: Eldest to Jacques and Bernard. Hell of a lot more
SUDDENLY: dangerous.
SUDDENLY: He runs the northern territories. Drugs, extortion,
SUDDENLY: gambling; you name it.
SUDDENLY: Revised 9-17-90, GREEN
SUDDENLY: #2.006
SUDDENLY: 7. CONTINUED:
SUDDENLY: There was a tape in Blackie's office of you playing
SUDDENLY: blackjack the night you and Big Ed visited the casino.
SUDDENLY: Jean Renault was after me.
SUDDENLY: The man who caught his brother.
SUDDENLY: Renault planned to kill me. And he used Audrey as bait.
SUDDENLY: It's a deeply troubling revelation. A long beat. Truman comforts, reminds:
SUDDENLY: We got her back, Coop. And she's going to be okay.
SUDDENLY: Cooper doesn't look convinced, a long beat. Then
SUDDENLY: I went out of my jurisdiction twice I've violated my
SUDDENLY: professional code. And Audrey is paying the price for it.
SUDDENLY: We did what we had to do.
SUDDENLY: This isn't the first time my actions have brought suffering
SUDDENLY: to someone I care about. In the name of 'doing what I
SUDDENLY: thought I had to do.' Dammit. I should have known better.
SUDDENLY: That doesn't change the fact that Audrey's here now. Not
SUDDENLY: up at Jack's with a needle in her arm.
SUDDENLY: You're the best lawman I've ever seen, Cooper. But
SUDDENLY: sometimes you think too much.
SUDDENLY: He says the latter with admiration and quiet humor. Cooper appreciates both.
SUDDENLY: Thank you, Harry.
SUDDENLY: #2.006
SUDDENLY: 7. CONTINUED:
SUDDENLY: HOLD ON this tableau for a beat. Cooper and Truman standing together.
SUDDENLY: 8. EXT. GREAT NORTHERN HOTEL - NIGHT
SUDDENLY: 9. INT. GREAT NORTHERN DINING ROOM - NIGHT
SUDDENLY: The middle of the night. Deserted, errie. Cooper walks through the empty room carrying a
SUDDENLY: briefcase full of cash.
SUDDENLY: BEN HORNE enters, finds Cooper waiting for him there. Ben is nervous, but trying hard to
SUDDENLY: hide it. How much does Cooper know?
SUDDENLY: Agent Cooper, I got your call.
SUDDENLY: What happened? Did you ... ?
SUDDENLY: We were able to free your daughter without payment.
SUDDENLY: Cooper hands him the briefcase.
SUDDENLY: Thank God.
SUDDENLY: Audrey was being held in a brothel north of the border
SUDDENLY: known as One-Eyed Jack's.
SUDDENLY: No.
SUDDENLY: The brothel's Madam was at least partially responsible
SUDDENLY: for your daughter's kidnapping and subsequent blackmail.
SUDDENLY: Ben pauses, fearing what Cooper might know. All the things Blackie could have told him.
SUDDENLY: Did you arrest her?
SUDDENLY: #2.006
SUDDENLY: 9. CONTINUED:
SUDDENLY: She was killed before we could question her.
SUDDENLY: No!
SUDDENLY: Murdered by a man named Jean Renault.
SUDDENLY: And this Renault, did you catch him?
SUDDENLY: He escaped.
SUDDENLY: Too bad.
SUDDENLY: Everything seems to be in order.
SUDDENLY: Audrey's recovering from a drug overdose.
SUDDENLY: Drug overdose? Oh my God.
SUDDENLY: She's going to be all right.
SUDDENLY: Can I see her?
SUDDENLY: I wouldn't disturb her now. She's resting, comfortably.
SUDDENLY: I'll call you in the morning.
SUDDENLY: Ben doesn't like his tone. But given the time and place, not to mention all the lies he's telling.
SUDDENLY: Yes, do that, Agent Cooper. Thank you.
SUDDENLY: Ben reaches out, takes Cooper into a celebratory hug. It's an odd, awkward gesture.
SUDDENLY: Unexpected. Completely devoid of feeling.
SUDDENLY: #2.006
SUDDENLY: 9. CONTINUED:
SUDDENLY: Thank you for bringing my Audrey back to me.
SUDDENLY: Cooper accepts the embrace. Grudgingly. Then extricates himself, prepatory to leaving
SUDDENLY: Good night, Mr. Horne.
SUDDENLY: Ben watches, wheels turning, as Cooper steps into the shadows.
SUDDENLY: #2.006
SUDDENLY: 10. INT. LEO JOHNSON'S HOME DAY
SUDDENLY: BOBBY BRIGGS, in sport coat and tie, struggles to push LEO JOHNSON in his wheelchair
SUDDENLY: through the doorway. It's too tight a fit. Bobby curses under his breath, struggles with the
SUDDENLY: chair. Maybe he can slide it through sideways.
SUDDENLY: SHELLY JOHNSON and an Insurance Representative, TOM BROCKMAN, watch Leo's
SUDDENLY: bumpy progress from the living room. Shelly winces with each shove and bang. Brockman,
SUDDENLY: fifties, unctuous, offers his best sympathy:
SUDDENLY: Poor fellow, really gone.
SUDDENLY: You ain't kiddin'.
SUDDENLY: Bobby finally gets Leo into the living room nearly losing control of the chair, but holds on
SUDDENLY: tight, manages a grim smile for Brockman. The Insurance Agent returns it.
SUDDENLY: I want you to know how much I admire you kids,
SUDDENLY: standing by Mr. Johnson. Not taking the easy way out.
SUDDENLY: Most people would just ship him off.
SUDDENLY: Yeah, well, Leo's sorta special to us.
SUDDENLY: Believe you me, in-home care is the stuff of miracles. It
SUDDENLY: may not always seem that way to you, but Mr. Johnson
SUDDENLY: should benefit tremendously from his being here among
SUDDENLY: his loved ones.
SUDDENLY: We certainly hope so.
SUDDENLY: Will you be hiring full or part-time help?
SUDDENLY: Cousin Bobby and I will be here full-time.
SUDDENLY: #2.006
SUDDENLY: 10. CONTINUED:
SUDDENLY: I admire your dedication.
SUDDENLY: Everything looks to be in order. You might want to child-
SUDDENLY: proof those electrical sockets when you get a chance. Sign
SUDDENLY: here ...
SUDDENLY: Brockman extracts a form from his briefcase. Shelly signs it.
SUDDENLY: Your check
SUDDENLY: Shelly opens it, reacts with disbelief.
SUDDENLY: There must be some mistake.
SUDDENLY: Bobby takes the check Looks at it. He can't believe it either.
SUDDENLY: 1700 bucks?
SUDDENLY: Sad, isn't it? The cost of health care is going through the
SUDDENLY: roof.
SUDDENLY: It's bringing rain. We're supposed to get five thousand a
SUDDENLY: month.
SUDDENLY: Figure state and local taxes, equipment fees, medical and
SUDDENLY: maintinence costs, administrative fees ... you see the
SUDDENLY: results. Fortunately with you two here Mr. Johnson will
SUDDENLY: be more than adequately provided for. Good luck
SUDDENLY: Brockman extends a hand for shaking. Bobby just looks at him for beat, a little dazed. Then
SUDDENLY: he offers an aimless handclasp. Brockman exits. Shelly turns to Bobby, mortified.
SUDDENLY: I have to quit my job, Bobby. How am I going to make
SUDDENLY: it on this?
SUDDENLY: I don't know.
SUDDENLY: #2.006
SUDDENLY: 10. CONTINUED:
SUDDENLY: You don't know? Bringing him home was your bright idea
SUDDENLY: in the first place -
SUDDENLY: I'm thinking.
SUDDENLY: Shelly stops, swallows hard. Fights a few unwanted tears.
SUDDENLY: Well you'd better think of somethin'. For both of us.
SUDDENLY: Just then: a quiet noise from Leo's chair. From Leo. It starts somewhere deep his chest,
SUDDENLY: then pours weakly out his lips. A moan. A protest. Bobby and Shelly both whirl about, stare
SUDDENLY: at Leo with amazement. His face remains blank. His eyes deeply empty. But the sound
SUDDENLY: continues, now stutters just a bit. HOLD ON Leo for a beat.
SUDDENLY: 11. INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY
SUDDENLY: Donna sits before a doubting Sheriff Truman in the Interrogation Room.
SUDDENLY: Donna. We, already have Laura Palmer's diary.
SUDDENLY: No, this is her secret diary.
SUDDENLY: And she gave it to this "Harold Smith?" Why?
SUDDENLY: I don't know. To hide it or something.
SUDDENLY: Did he ever actually show you the diary?
SUDDENLY: No. But he read from it. I saw her name on the inside
SUDDENLY: cover. Her handwriting.
SUDDENLY: Donna, are you and James up to something again, He's
SUDDENLY: been warned about getting mixed up -
SUDDENLY: James has nothing to do with this.

SUDDENLY: 11. CONTINUED:
SUDDENLY: I'm sorry, it's a little bit like the boy who cried wolf.
SUDDENLY: The last time you played this game Dr. Jacoby ended up
SUDDENLY: in a hospital bed.
SUDDENLY: It's not a game.
SUDDENLY: All right. I'll try to get someone out there to take a look.
SUDDENLY: We've got our hands full, I can't promise anything -
SUDDENLY: Sheriff, please -
SUDDENLY: Suddenly: a loud man stands in the doorway, interrupts. His name is GORDON COLE.
SUDDENLY: EXCUSE ME! I'M LOOKING FOR A SHERIFF
SUDDENLY: TRUMAN.
SUDDENLY: That's me.
SUDDENLY: Cole enters, extends a hand. He's in his forties and wears a pink hearing aid in each ear.
SUDDENLY: FBI REGIONAL BUREAU CHIEF, GORDON
SUDDENLY: COLE. THAT'S A REAL MOUTHFUL AND I
SUDDENLY: CAN'T HEAR MYSELF ANYWAY. I'M AGENT
SUDDENLY: COOPER'S SUPERVISOR.
SUDDENLY: Nice to meet you, sir. Excuse me a moment, Donna.

SUDDENLY: Are you looking for Agent Cooper?
SUDDENLY: I JUMP RIGHT UP AND PAY A VISIT.
SUDDENLY: Agent Cooper isn't here right now.
SUDDENLY: ALBERT ROSENFIELD IS NOT COMING BACK,
SUDDENLY: BUT I'VE GOT HIS WORK RIGHT HERE.

ITEM: Did Albert say anything else?
ITEM: CRIME SITE. FROM A DIARY.
ITEM: Revised 8-31-90,

ITEM: Just then: around the corner, another interruption. DEPUTY HAWK leads an angry PHILLIP
ITEM: MICHAEL GERARD, the one-armed salesman, towards lock-up.
ITEM: Since when is selling shoes against the law?
ITEM: THERE'S THE ONE-ARMER NOW.
ITEM: We need to ask you a few questions, Mr. Gerard. Why
ITEM: don't we all move to my office?
ITEM: Truman leads them away. Donna comes out of interrogation. HOLD ON Donna for a beat.
ITEM: She sighs, watches them go. She's got no one to tell her story to.
ITEM: 12. INT. BOOKHOUSE - DAY
ITEM: START CLOSE on Audrey, asleep, peaceful. Ben Horne's voice is heard:
ITEM: BEN'S VOICE
ITEM: She looks like an angel.
ITEM: ANOTHER ANGLE reveals Agent Cooper and Ben Horne standing over her. Cooper says
ITEM: nothing, just looks at Audrey. Then he kneels to wake her.
ITEM: Audrey? You're father is here.
ITEM: Audrey's eyes flutter open. She's weak, dreamy. Ben comes around from behind Cooper,
ITEM: crouches at her side.
ITEM: Thank god, Audrey. Thank god.
ITEM: Ben tries to embrace her. But Audrey focuses, realizes who it is. And recoils. Cooper takes
ITEM: notice. Ben shifts backward, plays the loving father without missing a beat.
ITEM: I was so worried about you.
ITEM: Were you?
ITEM: #2.006
ITEM: 12. CONTINUED:
ITEM: Worried sick. Times like these make a man aware of the
ITEM: value of life. Every raindrop. Every sunset.
ITEM: I'm aware of a lot of new things too.
ITEM: Don't talk now, sweetheart. We're going to get you
ITEM: home. Safe and warm. In your own bed. God, what a
ITEM: terrible experience. What terrible people. The things
ITEM: you must have seen.
ITEM: I saw so much.
ITEM: Ben tenses, checks to see if Cooper is listening. He is.
ITEM: We'll sort it out. Together.
ITEM: Yes. You and I, Daddy.
ITEM: That's my girl.
ITEM: (rises, happy to bring this duel to a conclusion; to
ITEM: Cooper)
ITEM: My car's outside. I'll take her home now.

ITEM: with you.

ITEM: NADINE HURLEY enters, carrying some boxes from Horne's.
ITEM: Ed, I'm home!
ITEM: Ed comes out of the kitchen to see her, wearing a teenager's JUMPER DRESS. She plops

ITEM: Isn't this the swellest dress you've ever seen? And you
ITEM: know, they didn't look at me twice when I used the
ITEM: credit card - say, Ed, when do my folks get back from

ITEM: When are your parents coming home?
ITEM: Poor, poor Ed.
ITEM: 14. INT. BLUE PINE LODGE LIBRARY - DAY
ITEM: START CLOSE on JOSIE PACKARD, lying upon a sofa. Her clothing in disarray, tear
ITEM: tracks on her cheeks. She sits up, unsteady, as if she had been assaulted.
ITEM: ANOTHER ANGLE reveals JONATHAN, the Asian Man, standing over her. He buckles
ITEM: his belt, adjusts his shirt, looks at her coldly. Boxes are strewn about the floor at his feet;
ITEM: Josie's shopping purchases, now scattered. Jonathan kneels, paws through the baubles and
ITEM: wrapping paper as one might the spoils of a war recently won.
ITEM: You've kept yourself in fine nick, Josie. Sapphire earrings
ITEM: ... Parisian perfume ... cashmere sweaters, silk blouses.
ITEM: Please go.
ITEM: He reaches into his jacket pocket, produces an envelope, tosses it to Josie. Josie flinches, the

ITEM: Ben Horne hasn't payed me yet; I've been waiting five
ITEM: years -
ITEM: Mr. Eckhardt will make it more than worth your while.
ITEM: You can't make me leave -
ITEM: Suddenly: Jonathan grabs Josie behind the neck, pulls her forward. Josie shudders, is afraid to
ITEM: resist. Jonathan offers a cold, hurtful kiss. Then he whispers.
ITEM: Be adaptable.
ITEM: We had an arrangement ...
ITEM: Jonathan releases her, now turns his grip into a caress, his fingers tracing her jawbone.
ITEM: Sheriff Truman is important to you. You be to him. You
ITEM: make him into a fool. But he is important to you
ITEM: nonetheless,
ITEM: Leave with me tonight. Or I'll kill him.
ITEM: He doesn't know anything -
ITEM: Jonathan's fingers move smoothly from jawbone to lips, silence her. It is a gesture both
ITEM: violent and sexual.
ITEM: The plane leaves at midnight. Be there. Or I will come
ITEM: for you. And your Sheriff. That's ... the arrangement.
ITEM: HOLD ON them for a beat.
ITEM: #2.006
ITEM: 15. EXT. LAKE - DAY
ITEM: James pulls up on his bike, approaches Maddy waiting, by the water. Both a little sad. Both
ITEM: wiser.
ITEM: I think I owe you an apology.
ITEM: Not really.
ITEM: When we were to together you know, just talking ... I felt
ITEM: something. I just wasn't sure.
ITEM: You looked at me and you saw Laura.
ITEM: I guess I did.
ITEM: Want to know somethin' strange? I liked it.
ITEM: You did?
ITEM: When we were growing up, Laura and I were so close it
ITEM: was scary. I could feel her thoughts. Like our brains were
ITEM: connected or something. Our mothers were the same way.
ITEM: When she died suddenly I had a chance to be Laura. At
ITEM: least other people saw me that way. Like the way you
ITEM: looked at me. I liked that too.
ITEM: It was wrong.
ITEM: It wasn't one thing or the other. For a while I got to be
ITEM: somebody different. Now I'm just me again.
ITEM: James pauses, uncertain. Maddy continues, reassures:
ITEM: #2.006
ITEM: 15. CONTINUED:
ITEM: You and Donna belong together. That's the best thing.
ITEM: It's hard sometimes, you know?
ITEM: How?
ITEM: If you really love someone, it's like this bright light is
ITEM: shining on you every minute. You're right in it. It's great.
ITEM: But I don't think you can stay that way all the time.
ITEM: Sure you can.
ITEM: I want to. I want to try to make the way my heart feels
ITEM: last forever. Pretty weird.
ITEM: Maddy doesn't think it's weird at all. A tender beat. Just a whisper of what might have been
ITEM: between them. Then Maddy offers a confession of her own:
ITEM: I'm going home tomorrow, James. I came to Twin Peaks
ITEM: for Laura's funeral. And I stayed for Uncle Leland and
ITEM: Aunt Sarah, just to help out. But it's time to go ...
ITEM: So this is goodbye or somethin' ...
ITEM: I guess it is.
ITEM: Bye, James.
ITEM: She gives him a sweet kiss. He smiles. They separate.

ITEM: Jerry brought back a case from some obscure French
ITEM: vineyard. I've been saving it for just such a special
ITEM: occasion as this.
ITEM: To "The Fire."
ITEM: Horne takes a sip, then steps behind his desk, sits. A more business-like mien.
ITEM: Now, to what do I owe the pleasure of this call?
ITEM: I've got the contract with Pete's Signature. I want my
ITEM: money.
ITEM: Of course you do.
ITEM: All of it. Now. Before you get this.
ITEM: Josie, Josie. Surely a mind as quicksilver as your own can
ITEM: grasp the complicated position we're in. Fluidity is all.
ITEM: I can't summon up cash reserves I don't have. But I have

ITEM: will immediately -
ITEM: I won't leave this office without my money
ITEM: Pause.
ITEM: Why do I sense this isn't a negotiable position? You're

ITEM: Games?

ITEM: This key unlocks my personal hotel safe. And inside that
ITEM: safe, I've put together a fascinating dossier on you, dear
ITEM: Josie, and husband Andrew's little boat that went boom.
ITEM: So you behave yourself, lady, or, believe me when I say
ITEM: this ... I will ... bury you.
ITEM: Josie moves towards him. Shows him a key.
ITEM: That's a shame. Because if anything unfortunate were to
ITEM: happen to me, it would lead authorities to a certain safety
ITEM: deposit box in another city. Inside of which is
ITEM: enough evident to put you away for three lifetimes.
ITEM: They'll bury us side by side.
ITEM: They stare at each other; mongoose and cobra.
ITEM: Stalemate.
ITEM: Now Josie moves towards Ben seductively, holding the contract.
ITEM: Your move. Cash.
ITEM: Happily, I can accomodate you.
ITEM: He goes back to his desk, retrieves TOJAMURA'S CASHIER'S CHECK and endorses it.
ITEM: A sign of my good faith. Tokyo bank. Five million
ITEM: dollars.
ITEM: Ben hands the check to Josie. She examines it. Folds it. Puts it away. Hands him the

ITEM: 18. INT. LEO JOHNSON'S HOUSE - NIGHT
ITEM: START CLOSE on Leo Johnson. Wheelchair bound, he wears a festive party hat, Ray Ban
ITEM: shades, and a blank expression. A kazoo hangs from his mouth, it bleats with each jagged
ITEM: breath. But Leo remains perfectly still. On permanent leave in the Land of Nod.
ITEM: ANOTHER ANGLE reveals Bobby and Shelly. Wearing party hats, piping a jaunty tune on
ITEM: their own kazoos, Auld Lang Syne. Shelly leads Leo to the dinner table, a cake before him.
ITEM: Bobby acts the mocking Master of Ceremonies.
ITEM: Leo, we figured with you gettin' out and all, well, what
ITEM: the hell, we sorta wanted to give you a little party. Our
ITEM: way of saying, hey, Leo Johnson, welcome home.
ITEM: Welcome home, darling.
ITEM: Bobby paces, steps behind Leo. Adjusts his glasses. Tweaks his nose.
ITEM: Cause you're a special guy, Leo. And we just want you to
ITEM: know that we remember all the great stuff you did for the
ITEM: ones you loved.
ITEM: Bobby pulls up Leo's hat, the elastic chin strap stretches, then Bobby lets it snap back down.
ITEM: Like Shelly here. Who could ask for a more caring and
ITEM: thoughtful husband? Makin' her clean your dirty clothes.
ITEM: Wash your dishes. Mop your floors. You're a class act,
ITEM: man. Top to bottom.
ITEM: And how 'bout Leo Johnson, wife abuser? There's a guy
ITEM: you want to party with. Soap in a sock. Internal injuries
ITEM: and barely leaves a bruise.
ITEM: But last, and I'm thinkin' not least, we got Leo Johnson,
ITEM: murderer. Hang your wife up like a piece of meat.
ITEM: Leave her to burn. Don't let anybody ever tell ya you
ITEM: don't know how to treat a woman.
ITEM: Bobby puts his arms around Shelly. Gives her a deep kiss. Both turn to look at Leo in his
ITEM: chair, festively decorated, utterly silent.

ITEM: "This is your life," Leo Johnson. You deserve it. Every

ITEM: Bobby kisses her again, gently pushes her backward, onto the table. Takes one last look at
ITEM: Leo.
ITEM: Sorta makes you believe in karma, don't it?
ITEM: Bobby kisses her more passionately, she returns his kisses with equal fervor. He pulls at her
ITEM: blouse, she hurries to unbutton his shirt. But then, she can't help it, Shelly turns to glance at
ITEM: Leo.
ITEM: Leo remains inert. But the angle, Shelly's guilty conscience, perhaps a flare of light off the Ray
ITEM: Bans, all conspire to suggest movement, some imperceptible shift in Leo's posture.
ITEM: Shelly SCREAMS. Rolls out from under Bobby.
ITEM: What? What?
ITEM: He moved. I saw him move.
ITEM: No. It's too creepy. It's wrong, Bobby.
ITEM: Bobby looks from Shelly to Leo. Walks to him.
ITEM: Okay, Shel. Maybe you're right. I mean I don't wanna
ITEM: exploit him or nothing.
ITEM: Bobby carefully removes the party hat, the shades. And the kazoo from Leo's mouth.
ITEM: Sorry, Leo. We sorta lost control. No need to make
ITEM: your rehabilitation any more difficult than it already is.
ITEM: Doc Hayward says you need 'familiar stimulus', so we
ITEM: just figured, what the hell ... kazoos.
ITEM: Bobby scoots Leo a little closer to the dinner table, the cake before him, continues, soothes:
ITEM: Honest, Leo, Shelly and me are gonna do everything we
ITEM: can to keep you safe and happy.
ITEM: You want some cake or somethin'? That'd be nice, huh?
ITEM: With ice cream?

ITEM: 18. CONTINUED:
ITEM: Bobby spoons a big scoop onto the cake as he speaks. Leo does a header into the cake and
ITEM: cream. Shelly gasps.
ITEM: Bobby!
ITEM: Bobby pulls Leo's face out of the cake, returns him to a sitting position. Turns to Shelly.
ITEM: Gee, you gotta be more careful, Leo. Good thing we
ITEM: didn't light the candles.
ITEM: A beat. Then, she can't help it... Shelly begins to laugh.
ITEM: Gordon Cole sits on a bench in the station foyer. He glances at his watch. Adjusts his

ITEM: AGENT DALE COOPER!
ITEM: Hello, Gordon. Hope you haven't been waiting too long.
ITEM: I'VE BEEN WAITING TO SEE YOU HERE FOR

ITEM: What can I do for you?

ITEM: WITHOUT A DOUBT. EVERYTHING IS A-

ITEM: Thanks, Harry.
ITEM: ANONYMOUS MESSAGE. SENT TO HOME
ITEM: BASE WITH YOUR NAME ON IT, COOP.

FADE OUT: Ben Horne paces while LELAND PALMER sits like a puppy watching him.
FADE OUT: I can't be too specific, Leland, but with Jerry on the road
FADE OUT: I need you back here. Let's just say I have a much better
FADE OUT: sense of what you've been through in the last few weeks.
FADE OUT: I appreciate that, Ben. And I appreciate the confidence.
FADE OUT: Really I do.
FADE OUT: If it weren't for your indictment, I could drop you into
FADE OUT: your old slot. Our friendship, our history together. But
FADE OUT: first I need to know you're okay.
FADE OUT: I am 100%. 110%. Let me prove it to you.
FADE OUT: We've taken a payment from the Icelanders on
FADE OUT: Ghostwood, but a group from the Orient wants in in the

FADE OUT: out. I'm about to take Mr. Big to dinner. We need to
FADE OUT: buy a little time here.
FADE OUT: First thing we do is re-survey the land. Required because
FADE OUT: of the fire. Set up a parade of inspectors, federal, state,
FADE OUT: and county 'til Jerry comes back with a full report. If
FADE OUT: there is money coming from either direction, we run it
FADE OUT: thru the Caymans, pick up some pocket money on the
FADE OUT: exchange rate. And if we have to we can drop escrow
FADE OUT: into a black hole for six months.
FADE OUT: That's my Leland.
FADE OUT: The phone RINGS, Ben answers it. Tojomura is waiting for him in the hotel bar. While Ben
FADE OUT: is occupied, Leland slips over to the bookshelf, a stuffed white fox displayed there. Leland

FADE OUT: Truman tries to read what is happening off of Josie's face.
FADE OUT: Josie?
FADE OUT: Harry, I don't believe you have met my assistant, Mr.
FADE OUT: Lee.
FADE OUT: Pleased to meet you.
FADE OUT: I'll take these to car.
FADE OUT: He nods to Truman and exits with the luggage.
FADE OUT: What are you doing?
FADE OUT: I'm going away.
FADE OUT: Pause. She moves away from him.
FADE OUT: Where? Why?
FADE OUT: I always called you from here. It was here I could talk to
FADE OUT: you and be everything you wanted me to be.
FADE OUT: Where are you going?
FADE OUT: I sold the mill. It's over. I'm going home.
FADE OUT: No.

FADE OUT: You waste my time. We shall withdraw.
FADE OUT: Oh, no. Please, Mr. Tojomura. Consider the position
FADE OUT: I'm in. The mill fire has created a raft of unforeseen
FADE OUT: problems, psychic as well as financial. It is my duty as
FADE OUT: a civic leader to foster the healing process, even at the
FADE OUT: temporary expense of my larger business opportunities.
FADE OUT: But I assure you -
FADE OUT: I know a little about fire. My family was at Nagasaki.
FADE OUT: And what a tragedy it was. Horrifying.
FADE OUT: From across the room, loud piano playing stops their conversation. They hear a singer.

FADE OUT: Excuse me a moment.

FADE OUT: Cooper turns back to Mike. Reacts. Truman and Hawk SEE what he sees. They freeze. And
FADE OUT: Mike the One-Armed Man begins a TRANSFORMATION. Mike fights it at first, he
FADE OUT: arches in his chair as if to fend off some invading spirit. But then his body relaxes completely,
FADE OUT: his arms fall to the side. Mike's features shift, a shadow passes into his eyes. His head, once

FADE OUT: There is no need for medicine. I am not in pain.
FADE OUT: Who are you?

FADE OUT: He is Bob, eager for fun. He wears a smile, everybody
FADE OUT: run.
FADE OUT: Do you understand the parasite? It attaches itself to a life
FADE OUT: form and feeds. Bob requires a human host. He feeds on
