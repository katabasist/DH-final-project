REVISED: EVELYN MARSH sits on the steps behind them playing the grieving widow.
REVISED: His room is completely empty.
REVISED: He's a drifter. I'm sure he was long gone once Mr. Marsh
REVISED: pulled out of the driveway.
REVISED: Would you know his full name?
REVISED: I barely knew the kid. Jim... ah, Jim -
REVISED: James Hurley. He said he was from Twin Peaks.
REVISED: Work here long?
REVISED: Mrs. Marsh hired him to fix the Jaguar.
REVISED: How did you meet him, Mrs. Marsh?
REVISED: Jeffrey's Jaguar broke down near Wally's. I went inside
REVISED: to use the phone and he offered to help.

REVISED: 3. INT. WALLY'S BAR - NIGHT
REVISED: JAMES and DONNA slide quietly, nervously into a booth in the bar.
REVISED: We can't get out of this by ourselves, James. We've got
REVISED: to get someone to help us.
REVISED: But I didn't do anything. Malcolm killed Mr. Marsh.
REVISED: I'm being framed
REVISED: It doesn't make any difference. We can't just wait for
REVISED: cops to catch us. I think you should call Big Ed.
REVISED: No, my only chance is to talk to Evelyn. If she told me
REVISED: this was a set up, maybe she'll tell the police, too.
REVISED: You wouldn't have a chance. The police will be waiting
REVISED: for you. We've got to keep moving.
REVISED: But she'd listen to me. I know she would.
REVISED: Would she? Why?

REVISED: His look tells her about his relationship with Evelyn.
REVISED: I'm gonna call Ed. Stay here.
REVISED: Donna moves quickly to the phone. Dials. It takes awhile for ED to answer.
REVISED: Ed, it's Donna. I don't have much time. James is in lots
REVISED: of trouble. He was working for this woman, repairing a
REVISED: car and there was an accident - James thinks -
REVISED: The COP from the Marsh House enters the bar. Donna stares at the cop and then at James who
REVISED: also watches the cop. James slides out of the bar. Donna is about to run after him when the
REVISED: Cop moves suspiciously towards her. She changes the subject.
REVISED: - so, tell me about your new boyfriend, Janie - he's
REVISED: really cure, isn't he? He lettered in football? What
REVISED: position does he play?
REVISED: The cop walks over to the bartender. They are obviously talking about James. MOVE BACK
REVISED: to the receiver sitting on top the pay phone. Donna is gone. On the other end is Ed's voice.

REVISED: We just want to know why Leo would attack you?
REVISED: Revised 12-4-90, BLUE
REVISED: 5. CONTINUED:
REVISED: Here's the deal. Shelly and I are together, okay? We
REVISED: have been for a long time, since before Laura died.
REVISED: Before and after Leo went into his drool mode.
REVISED: Bobby, where were you the night the mill burned?
REVISED: What's that got to do with this?
REVISED: Leo tried to kill you. Maybe you shot him that night.
REVISED: No way. I went to Shelly's house the night of the fire
REVISED: because I was worried about her. Leo was waiting for
REVISED: me. He was about to play Paul Bunyan on me when Hank
REVISED: Jennings shot him through the window.
REVISED: You sure it was Hank?
REVISED: Absolutely.
REVISED: Is this true Shelly?
REVISED: Yes.

REVISED: What about the insurance money?
REVISED: Just a happy accident. I figure Leo owed us that.
REVISED: Where do you think Leo went?
REVISED: You tell me.
REVISED: Bobby has no intention of saying anything else.
REVISED: That will be all for now, Bobby. Shelly you be careful.
REVISED: As Shelly and Bobby leave they bump into ALBERT ROSENFIELD in the doorway.
REVISED: Cooper is genuinely happy to see him.
REVISED: Albert.
REVISED: Another trip on the Seattle to Twin Peaks Shuttle. I'll
REVISED: confess to you gentlemen, coming down here today I
REVISED: toyed with singing "Ninety-Nine Bottles of Beer on the
REVISED: Wall."
REVISED: (opens his briefcase and drops a picture of Earle
REVISED: on the table)
REVISED: My invite back to Twin Peaks. Direct orders from
REVISED: Gordon Cole. As he so succinctly put it,
REVISED: "I'M WORRIED ABOUT COOP.
REVISED: (spreads out a map, pointing out a pattern
REVISED: marked on it)
REVISED: Biloxi, Houston, Oklahoma City, Salina, Lincoln,
REVISED: Chicago. Earle's been sending gift wrapped packages to
REVISED: police departments and offices of major law
REVISED: enforcement agencies. Each look like mail bombs, but
REVISED: turn out to be harmless. Deliveries are paid for with
REVISED: phony credit cards signed "Windom Earle." Cole's
REVISED: doing the follow up on this. He should run up here after
REVISED: that.

REVISED: Caroline ...
REVISED: He's got the DEA, FBI, Treasury, Postal Service and
REVISED: the Mississippi, Oklahoma, and Illinois state patrols
REVISED: looking for him. Invited all of them to the party, but
REVISED: my guess is he won't dance with anyone but you, Coop.
REVISED: Cooper is unnerved. Albert retrieves more work from his case.
REVISED: The vagrant in the office died from a knife wound
REVISED: severing the aorta. He'd been dead for two days.
REVISED: But it's finger was pointing to the chess board? How did
REVISED: he manage that with the rigamortis?
REVISED: Rigamortis goes from head to toe but after two days
REVISED: leaves the body toe to head. Earle waited for it to leave
REVISED: the arms and fingers so that he could maneuver them on
REVISED: the chess board.
REVISED: And then he played Zeus at the power station.
REVISED: How do you know?
REVISED: He left us this map. Taped under a table.
REVISED: Revised 12-4-90, BLUE
REVISED: 2.015 7.
REVISED: 5. CONTINUED:
REVISED: Cooper moves away from the map. Stares our the window. Albert worries for his friend.
REVISED: He's making his move. Most definitely.
REVISED: Albert moves to the door. Tries to cheer Cooper up.
REVISED: About the uniform, Coop. Replacing the elegance of the
REVISED: dark suit and tie with the casual indifference of a mouse
REVISED: brown work outfit is a form of fashion suicide, but, call
REVISED: me crazy, I like it.
REVISED: Albert goes out. Truman studies the frightened Cooper.
REVISED: 6. INT. WINDOM EARLE'S CABIN - DAY
REVISED: LEO JOHNSON in bed with his wounds from the night before freshly dressed. WINDOM
REVISED: EARLE sits next to him playing an antique wooden flute. Five stainless steel square suitcases
REVISED: rest near him. The chess board is set up on the table. A small school desk sits by the door.
REVISED: On one wall is a Earle's high tech command module - computer, modem, monitoring
REVISED: devices, police scanners. Leo awakes to the haunting flute music.
REVISED: Ah, you are awake, then.
REVISED: I trust you've slept well.
REVISED: (goes to his computer returns with Leo's picture
REVISED: and a police APB)
REVISED: While you slept I've learned all about you.

REVISED: 6. CONTINUED:
REVISED: "Drug trafficking, arson, attempted murder."
REVISED: "Domestic violence." I'm partial to that.
REVISED: Leo tries to make a bolt for the door. Earle slams his wound with his flute. Leo falls back.
REVISED: Well, Leo, I have cleansed your wounds. You're on the
REVISED: mend. I've removed the proverbial thorn from your paw.
REVISED: Leo. Leo the Lion.
REVISED: I want you to help me. And obey me. Will you do
REVISED: that?
REVISED: Leo hesitates. Earle shows the flute to Leo.
REVISED: In thirteenth century Japan the Samurai were stripped of
REVISED: their weaponry. But they discovered that the aged and
REVISED: treated bamboo of their Shaku hachi flute made an
REVISED: excellent cudgel.
REVISED: This flute is truly an instrument of pleasure, don't you
REVISED: think?
REVISED: Leo tries to make a run for it, but merely allows Earle to have more fun with his flute. It ends
REVISED: with Earle standing over Leo near the doorway. He takes a dog collar out of his coat.
REVISED: I wanted to save this necklace for an "occasion," but now
REVISED: you've ruined it.
REVISED: He wraps the collar around Leo's neck. Attached is a round object that looks like a beer can.
REVISED: Now, come over here. I've made you some gruel.
REVISED: As Earle returns to the table, Leo scrambles for the door. He stops short. Struggling with an
REVISED: electrical shock coming from the collar. He falls backwards. Stunned. Earle sits at his table.
REVISED: Come here, Leo. Come on.
REVISED: Leo struggles towards the table as Earle plays his flute.

FADE OUT: ED HURLEY and NORMA JENNINGS lie in bed. Norma snuggles next to Ed.
FADE OUT: Almost twenty years, Norma. One day we're talking
FADE OUT: about a graduation party and the next day we're here. In
FADE OUT: between nothing but hurt.
FADE OUT: I tried not to think about it. Spent more and more time
FADE OUT: in the diner trying to make the place work because there
FADE OUT: was nothing else. We were open everyday so that I
FADE OUT: wouldn't have another life. No birthdays, no Fourth of
FADE OUT: July, no Christmas.
FADE OUT: I turned all my Christmases into a week full of
FADE OUT: Mondays. When that didn't work I'd spend my time
FADE OUT: thinking about presents I never got to buy you. Never got
FADE OUT: to give you.
FADE OUT: I bought you a present last Christmas. An onyx and
FADE OUT: turquoise bolo tie. I walked over to your house to give it
FADE OUT: to you, but I just stood there and waited to see you
FADE OUT: through a window. I should have just walked right in. I
FADE OUT: don't know why I didn't. I'm sorry I didn't.
FADE OUT: All the time that you should have been in my home. My
FADE OUT: bed.
FADE OUT: It's about the future now, Ed, and what we are going to
FADE OUT: do about it.
FADE OUT: I want you to pick me up after I close the diner, tonight,
FADE OUT: and I want you to take me home.

FADE OUT: Norma scrambles to get her clothes on, but Ed stops her.
FADE OUT: Don't Norma. I may as well talk to her now.
FADE OUT: Before they can get up, NADINE HURLEY walks into the room. She sits dejectedly on the
FADE OUT: bed. She carries a trophy.
FADE OUT: Hello, Nadine.
FADE OUT: Got all the way to the District Finals at Knife River
FADE OUT: only to find out the airplane slam is illegal. I was
FADE OUT: disqualified.
FADE OUT: Second Place. What a drag.
FADE OUT: That's a tough break, alright.
FADE OUT: Nadine stares at Norma for a moment.
FADE OUT: Hello, Nadine.
FADE OUT: I owe you an apology, Norma. I mean I really pounded
FADE OUT: Hank and I am sorry. But I thought he was going to do
FADE OUT: something to Eddie and I sort of got mad.
FADE OUT: Thank you.
FADE OUT: Nadine gets up and walks to the door. Turns back.
FADE OUT: Know what?
FADE OUT: I know about you guys. And it's really, really okay.
FADE OUT: Cause now, I don't feel so guilty about me and Mike.

FADE OUT: I don't want to get into it, but I have to tell you, it is
FADE OUT: really, really serious.
FADE OUT: So you two should do whatever you want. I am
FADE OUT: completely cool about all of this. Really.
FADE OUT: Nadine slowly exits leaving a baffled Norma and Ed.

FADE OUT: Truman and Cooper sit across a table from JOSIE PACKARD who is in her maid's outfit.
FADE OUT: The newspaper clipping with Jonathan's picture lies between them.
FADE OUT: Josie, this is it. I have to tell the police in Seattle
FADE OUT: something. They asked me to question you. They know
FADE OUT: you're connected with Jonathan.
FADE OUT: How did he die? Was it a robbery?
FADE OUT: He was shot three times in the back of the head.
FADE OUT: Josie begins to cry. Uneasy, Cooper checks his coffee cup
FADE OUT: I think I'll get another cup of joe.
FADE OUT: Cooper walks to the kitchen area. Truman presses Josie.
FADE OUT: If you were ever going to tell the truth, Josie, this would
FADE OUT: be an ideal time.
FADE OUT: Josie trembles with fear.
FADE OUT: 9. INT. BLUE PINE LODGE, KITCHEN AREA - DAY

FADE OUT: I get over to the "Clean and Save" and Jeanie Pombelek was working
FADE OUT: the counter. She doesn't speak a word of English. Nada. Zip. She's
FADE OUT: from Budapest. We just stood there and looked at each other like we
FADE OUT: were made of wood.
FADE OUT: Something in the laundry catches Cooper's eye.
FADE OUT: Who does all this belong to?
FADE OUT: Catherine's runnin' her into the ground so I offered to stop by
FADE OUT: the dry cleaner and pick up Josie's stuff.
FADE OUT: The only words I know in Hungarian are paprika and goulash.
FADE OUT: It took me twenty minutes to get this stuff.
FADE OUT: Cooper takes a COAT out of the dry cleaning.
FADE OUT: This is Josie's?
FADE OUT: Yep.
FADE OUT: The phone rings. Pete answers it.
FADE OUT: Hello ... Just a minute.
FADE OUT: It's for Josie, she here?
FADE OUT: In the other room.
FADE OUT: Pete moves into the next room.
FADE OUT: PETE'S VOICE
FADE OUT: Josie, it's for you.
FADE OUT: Cooper moves quickly to the coat and taking out his pocket knife cuts away a small piece of
FADE OUT: fabric from the Vicuna coat. He then opens the coat and there are a pair of gloves pinned to
FADE OUT: the hanger. He takes the gloves.

INTERCUT: Josie, it's Thomas. I'm so glad I've found you. I'm
INTERCUT: wondering if we can get together.
INTERCUT: Terrified, Josie stands frozen with the phone in her hand.
INTERCUT: Did you hear about what's happened to Jonathan?
INTERCUT: Dreadful. Dreadful.
INTERCUT: 11. INT. BLUE PINE LODGE - ANOTHER PHONE IN THE HOUSE

INTERCUT: Welcome to Twin Peaks, Mr. Eckhardt.
INTERCUT: 12. ECKHARDT'S ROOM - DAY
INTERCUT: Eckhardt hangs up the phone. JONES stands behind him.
INTERCUT: She's run back to Catherine Martell. I am disappointed.
INTERCUT: She's become predictable.
INTERCUT: I warned you not to trust her.
INTERCUT: Jones returns to some suitcases on the bed and her unpacking. There are maps, blue prints,

INTERCUT: BEN HORNE talks to a stunned group of HOTEL STAFF. He sits on a saddle draped over
INTERCUT: a STUFFED HORSE. Young JOHNNY HORNE stands nearby, arms folded, Indian
INTERCUT: headdress on, mind blank and jumbled. DR. JACOBY stands to one side. Observing.
INTERCUT: So I said to Stonewall Jackson. "What would you like
INTERCUT: to do when we run the Yanks up to Canada?" And he says,
INTERCUT: "Follow them. I'd like to be the Duke of Montreal."
INTERCUT: And I say to Stonewall, "Then we'd have to fight the
INTERCUT: French?" And then he just gives me that Stonewall look
INTERCUT: of his and says, 'What are we waiting for?"
INTERCUT: Ben laughs heartily. Johnny gives a hearty howl. The Hotel staff reacts with ashen silence.
INTERCUT: Jacoby walks to the back of the room to confer with a bemused JERRY HORNE and a
INTERCUT: concerned AUDREY.
INTERCUT: What do you think, Dr. Jacoby?
INTERCUT: Letting him out to mingle with the public does not seem
INTERCUT: to have helped.
INTERCUT: We can't just leave him like this.
INTERCUT: Well, you have to admit he's kind'a fun this way.

INTERCUT: the staff and up to Aubrey. He is dressed as a CONFEDERATE BUGLE BOY.
INTERCUT: Sorry, I'm late boss.
INTERCUT: HOLD ON this incongrous tableau, as Ben chatters on in the background...
INTERCUT: I asked Stonewall what I should do with Lincoln and he
INTERCUT: said, "Honest Abe is going to be about as useful to you
INTERCUT: as a spittoon cleaner in a whorehouse."

INTERCUT: You don't get it do you? I'm talking about our lives.
INTERCUT: Life will be rosy if you can just get out of one silly little

FADE OUT: Pete, I need your help. I'm playing a chess match of
FADE OUT: considerable importance. I can't tell you any more than
FADE OUT: that. I want to put the game into a stalemate while
FADE OUT: losing the least number of pieces possible. None, if you
FADE OUT: can arrange it.
FADE OUT: Agent Cooper, I'd be honored to serve. Chess being my

FADE OUT: Thanks, Pete. Great players are either far or few.
FADE OUT: Pete puffs up with pride. He nearly salutes.

FADE OUT: Hi.
FADE OUT: Shelly. I heard about Leo. Are you okay?
FADE OUT: Sure. Bobby's looking after me, so I guess I'm safe and
FADE OUT: everything...
FADE OUT: I wanted to come right over. But with Hank gone, it's a
FADE OUT: madhouse around here.
FADE OUT: Well ... do you need any help? I've got plenty of time
FADE OUT: now... I'd feel better during the day, you know, if I was
FADE OUT: here...
FADE OUT: Shelly's asking for her old job back. And Norma knows it.
FADE OUT: Are you kidding? Things aren't the same without you.
FADE OUT: When can you start?
FADE OUT: I don't know, I guess I could start ... now.
FADE OUT: Welcome back, sweetheart.
FADE OUT: They hug. A nice beat. Truman interrupts:
FADE OUT: Excuse me, Norma? Can I talk to you for a minute?
FADE OUT: Sure.
FADE OUT: Your apron's in the back.
FADE OUT: Shelly beams, steps off Truman and Norma speak privately:
FADE OUT: Hank's nearly well enough to leave the hospital. I

FADE OUT: What about his parole violations? Harry, this time I
FADE OUT: don't want him back.
FADE OUT: I wouldn't worry. Hank's next stop is a jail cell. We're
FADE OUT: charging him with the attempted murder of Leo Johnson.
FADE OUT: Add that to breaking parole...it looks like Hank's going
FADE OUT: away for a long, long time.
FADE OUT: Good.
FADE OUT: Pete is HEARD shouting checkmate off-screen. Another speedy triumph.

FADE OUT: Josie, please. Give the fork a little room.
FADE OUT: Put it right there. Perfect. Now you may prepare to

FADE OUT: Who will be joining you this evening?
FADE OUT: That is secret.
FADE OUT: Just then: the DOORBELL rings. Josie reacts with a start.
FADE OUT: The door ... ?
FADE OUT: Josie nods, steps to answer it. She opens the door, goes white with fear. THOMAS
FADE OUT: ECKHARDT stands before her. He stares at Josie with dark soulless eyes. Catherine chirps
FADE OUT: from the rear.

FADE OUT: Ahh, Mister Eckhardt. Welcome.
FADE OUT: Josie reacts with a trembling panic, uncertain whether to stay or flee. Eckhardt finally turns his
FADE OUT: gaze from her, smiles at Catherine as she approaches.
FADE OUT: Thank you.
FADE OUT: Josie, where are your manners? Help our guest with his
FADE OUT: coat.
FADE OUT: Eckhardt turns back to Josie. Catherine smiles. HOLD ON Josie as she reaches for Eckhardt's

FADE OUT: table. They converse, run forks through salads on fine china.
FADE OUT: I must confess I received your invitation with some
FADE OUT: surprise.
FADE OUT: Word travels fast in Twin Peaks. It seemed fitting that
FADE OUT: I dine with my late brother's business rival. Some wine,
FADE OUT: Josie.
FADE OUT: Eckhardt listens to Catherine's charter, now looks up at Josie as she steps toward them
FADE OUT: Your brother was not always my rival. We were friends.
FADE OUT: Andrew was a witty, intelligent, and charming man.
FADE OUT: Plaudits no doubt employed to describe his sister as well.
FADE OUT: But your friendship soured.
FADE OUT: Sadly. Men of business frequently find their personal
FADE OUT: lives disrupted by the larger portraits they paint.

FADE OUT: Of a sort. Your brother was as well.
FADE OUT: I wonder, Mister Eckhardt. When you had him killed,
FADE OUT: was it for art or money? Don't stand there, Josie, pour.
FADE OUT: Josie nearly drops her bottle of wine. But Eckhardt betrays no reaction. He simply turns his
FADE OUT: gaze from Josie to Catherine. Catherine's playing a dangerous game. Eckhardt will play
FADE OUT: along ... for now. Josie pours blood-red wine into crystal glasses with a shaking hand.
FADE OUT: Call me Thomas. Your brother did.
FADE OUT: Thomas. We'll have the h'or d'ouerves now, Josie.
FADE OUT: Josie moves off to fetch them. As the conversation continues:
FADE OUT: One does not kill for art or money. They are
FADE OUT: commodities easily lost, but just as easily gained.
FADE OUT: However, one -
FADE OUT: - rather, I, would find reason to kill for love.
FADE OUT: Did you love her that much?
FADE OUT: Josie returns, offering a tray of canapes. Eckhardt's tone has been cratonic throughout. But now
FADE OUT: he pauses. looks at Josie. Takes a small confection from the tray. And speaks quietly:
FADE OUT: Yes.
FADE OUT: Eckhardt pops the canape in his mouth. Josie nearly drops the tray. Catherine speaks evenly, as
FADE OUT: if describing a prized possession.
FADE OUT: Josie has the most incredible hands. They effect a sort
FADE OUT: of porcelain grace. Each finger a thing of beauty.

FADE OUT: Eckhardt reaches out to touch Josie's hand. Josie stands up with a start, freezes. Eckhardt never
FADE OUT: takes his eyes from her.
FADE OUT: I wonder. What shall we do with her now?
FADE OUT: You've come so far to Twin Peaks. It would be a shame
FADE OUT: to leave us empty-handed.
FADE OUT: It would.
FADE OUT: On the other hand, Josie is almost completely
FADE OUT: untrustworthy. She'll betray you again. And again.
FADE OUT: I have managed to find pleasure in even that repetition.
FADE OUT: Of course I'll miss her cheery disposition. We've
FADE OUT: become the very best of friends. Two girls chatting over
FADE OUT: tea ...
FADE OUT: Perhaps you should purchase an animal of some kind. A
FADE OUT: cat or a dog.
FADE OUT: But if I give her to you. What will you give me in

FADE OUT: Evelyn Marsh steps through the dark living room. She carries drink and cigarette, sits upon a

FADE OUT: the ceiling. Just then: a VOICE in the dark.
FADE OUT: JAMES' VOICE
FADE OUT: Why did you do it?
FADE OUT: Evelyn reacts, startled. James steps out of the black.
FADE OUT: I've been givin' it a lot of thought. And I still don't
FADE OUT: understand.
FADE OUT: James pauses, pent up, full of anger. Evelyn stands to meet him.
FADE OUT: James, you're not safe here. If Malcom finds you...
FADE OUT: For money, is that it? No, wait. I got it: Malcom's a

FADE OUT: believe that. Make me believe it, Evelyn. Tell me a
FADE OUT: story. 'Cause I'm all mixed up and I just want to know
FADE OUT: why you did this to me.
FADE OUT: James...
FADE OUT: Don't touch me.
FADE OUT: Evelyn pauses. A long beat, then she whispers:
FADE OUT: What did you expect? Apology? A hidden heart of
FADE OUT: gold?
FADE OUT: I did it all. Everything. I found you I lured you in.
FADE OUT: And I kept you here while Malcom planned a nice, neat
FADE OUT: frame.
FADE OUT: Why?
FADE OUT: For the money. Out of fear. Because I wanted to.
FADE OUT: Her words chill him. James' anger subsides. He expected excuses, regret. Anything but this.
FADE OUT: That's not exactly what you want to hear, is it, James?
FADE OUT: The truth hurts. I know.
FADE OUT: James stares into her eyes. Evelyn moves closer. The truth hurts her too:
FADE OUT: You're good and you're honest. I'm not. But that doesn't
FADE OUT: mean there weren't moments when I truly wanted you
FADE OUT: here. Not for the money or for Malcom. But for me.
FADE OUT: For the good and honest way you taste.
FADE OUT: A long beat. And despite everything she's told him, or perhaps, in some odd way, because of
FADE OUT: it...James steps toward Evelyn's arms.
FADE OUT: I wanted you too.

FADE OUT: MALCOLM APPEARS, STRIKES JAMES ON THE HEAD. James slips to the floor, lies
FADE OUT: still. Evelyn looks at his inert form with shock, then to Malcolm.
FADE OUT: Malcolm speaks quietly, words for Evelyn to commit to memory. Her story, her alibi, a tale
FADE OUT: to be told to the police.
FADE OUT: James broke into the house. He was angry, he was crazy.
FADE OUT: He killed Jeffrey and now he came back to kill you. A
FADE OUT: poor, helpless widow. But you were ready for him,

FADE OUT: A fire burns in the hearth casting warm light about the cabin. Windom Earle peers into a
FADE OUT: mirror, carefully affixes a false mustache to his face, other concealing facial hair. He speaks
FADE OUT: aloud as he prepares his disguise:
FADE OUT: Work slowly and with care. Everything must be written
FADE OUT: in a steady, uncompromising hand.
FADE OUT: Leo sits at a small wooden school desk, concentrates on a piece of writing paper before him.
FADE OUT: He painstakingly copies from an open book of poetry, produces a version in his own hand. The
FADE OUT: shock-collar still hangs about his neck. Earle steps behind him, peers over Leo's shoulder. He
FADE OUT: uses his flute as a yard stick or marker.
FADE OUT: No, no, no. Terrible.
FADE OUT: Erase.
FADE OUT: Earle produces the shock collar control, presses a button. A low-grade SHOCK shivers
FADE OUT: through Leo's body. Leo reacts with a shudder. Then erases in haste, looks up at Earle with
FADE OUT: plaintive expression.
FADE OUT: Now. Try again. Concentrate.
FADE OUT: Leo looks back to the paper. As if it was responsible for the shocks that course through him.
FADE OUT: He puts pen to paper. But he errs again.
FADE OUT: Oh, Leo. For heaven's sake.
FADE OUT: Another stinging shock. Leo turns, as if to flee. But Earle is upon him. He grabs Leo's hand in
FADE OUT: an iron grip.
FADE OUT: Let me show you.
FADE OUT: Earle guides Leo's hand to the paper. And carefully leads him through the difficult section.
FADE OUT: There is something odd and tender about Earle's actions. As teacher to pupil. Father to son.

FADE OUT: I am proud of you, Leo.
FADE OUT: Leo looks up it Earle, eager to curry his favor, whispers.
FADE OUT: Windom ... Earle...
FADE OUT: Yes. Windom.
FADE OUT: Earle picks up Leo's work. THREE child-like VALENTINES. In the center of each heart is
FADE OUT: a picture: Shelly, Donna, and Aubrey. They are surveillance photos. Leo has written their
FADE OUT: names on each valentine.
FADE OUT: Pretty words for pretty girls. Which one will be my
FADE OUT: Queen?
FADE OUT: Queen ...
FADE OUT: Earle carefully tears the page into vertical thirds . Leo reacts with a protesting groan.
FADE OUT: No...
FADE OUT: Earle looks at him sharply. Leo cowers at his school-desk. Earle produces three identical

FADE OUT: A surreal tableau follows. Grant's surrender as enacted by Ben Horne (as the victorious General
FADE OUT: Lee), Dr. Jacoby , Jerry Horne , Aubrey
FADE OUT: and Bobby .
FADE OUT: Ben pauses, midroom, surveys the small table at its center, the players grouped about him.
FADE OUT: Aubrey steps forward with a smile.
FADE OUT: Welcome to our humble home, General Lee.
FADE OUT: Thank you. You are ...?
FADE OUT: Scarlett McLean. This is my father.
FADE OUT: Aubrey gestures toward Jerry in his farmer's suit. But Jerry misses his cue, stands frozen with
FADE OUT: stage fright. So Aubrey repeats:
FADE OUT: This is my father.
FADE OUT: Jerry reacts, hurries forward, still clutching Ben's sword.
FADE OUT: Wilmer McLean at your service. I'm indeed honored to
FADE OUT: make your extremely suitable acquaintance.
FADE OUT: Why are you armed with my sword?
FADE OUT: I ... like your sword. Sire.

FADE OUT: General Grant's a-comin', sire. I know'd it.
FADE OUT: An awkward beat. Jacoby remains in hiding. Someone's missed their cue. Jerry looks at
FADE OUT: Aubrey. Aubrey frowns, shoots a look at Bobby. Bobby plays a hasty toot on the bugle. The
FADE OUT: cue Jacoby's been waiting for. A beat. And he steps forward, with as much diginity as
FADE OUT: stepping from behind a curtain allows, into the room. Ben reacts to the odd entrance, ignores
FADE OUT: it. And extends a hand.
FADE OUT: General Grant.
FADE OUT: General Lee.

FADE OUT: She gestures toward the small round table. They sit.
FADE OUT: We once met during the Mexican War. Do you

FADE OUT: sticking to the script)
FADE OUT: I have come to surrender the North.
FADE OUT: Ben reacts. Is he the only sane man in the room?

FADE OUT: Well. They have my eternal respect and sympathy.
FADE OUT: Very well, General. Enough fruitless conversation. My

FADE OUT: I thought the North won the Civil War...

FADE OUT: shots, tightly grouped. Like the gun went off in your

FADE OUT: staggers, Malcom falls dead to the floor. A beat. Donna weeps, cradles James in her arms.
FADE OUT: Evelyn drops the gun. And in a voice totally devoid of emotion, begins to recite the story
FADE OUT: Malcom taught her.
